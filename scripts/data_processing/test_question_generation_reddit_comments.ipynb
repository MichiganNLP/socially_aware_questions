And I make around $400. We have a car payment that is $341.40 as well as the insurance which is $121.00 . My girlfriend is depressed and we don’t have enough to get her any help. \\n\\nI need help figuring out how to make our quality of life any better at all. Idk if we are allowed to apply for welfare or even how to start that process. Any advice would be greatly appreciated !\\n\\nUpdate: thank all of y’all for the advice and I appreciate the time. I’m sorry I couldn’t directly respond to all but I’ve been inspired. God bless.',\n",
       "       'I\\'ve been trying to think of how to condense this question so it\\'s more palatable for a quicker response, but I\\'m at a loss, so I hope somebody is willing to read this novel-length post.\\n\\nMy fiancee lives in New York state. Due to severe PTSD and mental illness, she has never been able to work and is currently in a supported housing program, living in an affordable housing building, the construction of which was funded by government grants, and is owned by the same company that runs her housing program. She  pays a portion of her rent from her monthly deposit, and the housing program pays the rest. I am not sure as to the specifics, but that\\'s the general gist.\\n\\nBack in June, due to a recent traumatic experience, she left her apartment building and stayed with a friend for a little over a month. During this time, the property manager of her apartment building was preparing to have a select number of units (approximately 25% of them, to be a little more precise) inspected by one of the investors involved in the building\\'s construction. At this point in time, it was not clear exactly which units would get inspected, so it was advised that all tenants tidy up. For whatever reason, the last time he had been in my fiancee\\'s unit, the property manager felt there could be some cleaning up done. Keep in mind, none of these things he wanted addressed violated any safety or health codes. So when it came out that the investors could potentially see her apartment, and knowing she was currently away, he wanted to hire a professional cleaner to go in and tidy the place up. He contacted her case worker from her housing program and asked if this would be okay. Knowing her psychological and emotional trauma history, the case worker knew right away that this would not be a good idea. The case worker, in turn, contacted my fiancee for confirmation, and sure enough, she confirmed that she would not be able to handle this psychologically or emotionally. She suggested, then, that if the property manager was that concerned about the condition of the place, that I be allowed entry while she was still away, wherein I could tidy things up in a manner that would not cause any repercussions for her psychological wellbeing. The case worker then took this information to the property manager, who was more than happy to have his security buzz me into the building and let me into the apartment. This seemed like a fair compromise.\\n\\nI actually live out of state, and had quite a long day the day of my trip, so when I showed up, I didn\\'t look around much, and just went to bed. When I woke up that morning however, I was woken up by the sound of someone knocking on the door. It was housekeeping. They were attempting to enter the apartment before they were informed that my fiancee does not pay for a housekeeping service. They apologized for their mistake and continued on. However, this was far from the first time this had happened. My fiancee had lodged several complaints to the property manager in the previous year or more about housekeeping mistakenly trying to enter her unit. Each time, he\\'d claim that he\\'d speak with them, but the \"mistakes\" never stopped. So that in and of itself was an ongoing problem. Anyway, I started looking around the apartment and noticed the place was nearly spotless. This didn\\'t surprise me, as my  fiancee keeps a clean home, which is why the request to hire a cleaner in the first place baffled me. I literally just threw out a few cardboard boxes and took out the garbage. That was the extent of any cleaning I did. At this point, I called up the property manager and asked him to come and look at the unit. He did, and talked about how pleased he was with the look of the apartment. He also told me, referring to some past interactions he\\'d had with my fiancee, that he didn\\'t want me to think he was being a jerk to her, he just hated watching her suffer. He seemed genuinely emotional when he told me this. For context, they had had some strained and difficult interactions in the past year revolving around her receiving assistance from staff that was related to her illness. He eventually went on his way and I was alone in the apartment once again. But looking around the apartment, something didn\\'t seem right.\\n\\nI video called my fiancee and we started talking about this. We noticed several items that were either moved or outright missing. She was already extremely ill at ease seeing this and started to freak out a little. Again, going into the ins and outs of her illness would be far more than you\\'d be willing to read right now, so you\\'ll just have to take my word that this is very, very serious. So at this point, I got my luggage together and went to see my fiancee at her friends\\'. We spent a few days there before spending a week and a half at a motel, trying to get in touch with her case worker to see what could be done about the possibility of someone having entered her apartment while she was away. She was not yet comfortable returning home, before knowing what had happened to her apartment, if you\\'re wondering why we spent time in the motel.\\n\\nOnce we finally did get in touch with the case worker, a meeting was arranged with him, another representative from the housing program, and her mental health treatment team. During this meeting, it came to light that the property manager had, in fact, had the apartment professionally cleaned and had let either one cleaner or a team of cleaners into the unit while my fiancee was away, without her consent. Remember when he contacted her case worker to see if it was okay? Well, by that point, he had already arranged it, which means he did that without contacting literally anyone first. Which also means that when he agreed to let me into the unit to clean it, he knew that 99% of the cleaning had already been done. So not only did he allow someone into her apartment without her consent for non-emergency purposes, he had also lied about doing it. And while he did not know everything about her mental health case, my fiancee had told him enough that he would know what kind of psychological damage he was risking with her. And when myself, my fiancee, and her case worker returned to see the apartment, my fiancee looked around the apartment and, upon seeing what had been done, had a full-on mental breakdown. Once again, without getting into the ins and out of her trauma history and mental illness, I can\\'t explain why, but she was inconsolable and distraught in such a manner that I was concerned for her safety.\\n\\nTo this day, she hasn\\'t felt safe in her home, and her mental health symptoms have went completely downhill since this incident, in a way I have not seen in all the years we\\'ve been together. The property manager will not speak to her directly and has the building\\'s secretary call her if he wants to tell her anything. He is also pressuring her and the housing program to agree to a new lease, as it also happens to the time of year that they\\'re renewing leases. But he seems particularly eager in this case.\\n\\nAfter all of this, bottom line, what can we do here legally? Between allowing strangers into her home without consent for non-emergency purposes while she was away, and the absolutely profound and downright scary psychological damage he knowingly inflicted (this incident undid a decade\\'s worth of trauma counselling), what can we do?',\n",

These were almost entirely fake and make no sense if you know me ( I like guns but don't own them, have plenty of friends, keep my cool, etc). During the course of this investigation the school went through my browser history from home without notifying me. They did this by signing into a school computer on my account that I had signed into chrome on, allowing them to access my browser history. This was unnecessary as the school's server logs all web traffic and in some of the rooms they can check whats on a screen at any given moment. They presented me with some things I had been looking online, at home, after school hours, on a personal computer on a personal account and asked me about them. My understanding is that this violated my rights against search and seizure, as all of the data they searched was not connected to school and they didn't notify me. I found out about the investigation two hours after it started because the detective involved requested access for a google file and I looked him up ( hes a pretty cool dude by the way shout out to him).\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nWere my rights violated? What courses of action can I take to prevent this from happening in the future?\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nEdit: This is an alt so I might not remember to check it too often\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEdit2: When I say the tips were fake, what I mean is only one of them is even close to anything I said, it was entirely non serious and out of context.

       "       'I\\'ve been helping my in-laws with their retirment savings. They had a high expense ratio roth IRA with Primerica, which I got them to agree to roll over to a low cost Vanguard fund. When you do a rollover with Vanguard, they send you paperwork to fill out, ask for account statements, etc. All seemingly standard stuff. I filled out the paperwork over 2 months ago, and the transfer is still not complete. \\n\\nFirst, Vanguard found an unspecified issue with the paperwork I submitted. Instead of correcting the individual issue (whatever that was), they told me that their form had changed from LAST WEEK to now, and had me fill out a new form. The new form seemed to have a few missing lines or errors. I called and asked a rep about this; I was told there were no issues with the form and to please submit it. I did, and 6 weeks later, still no rollover.\\n\\nEvery week, I get a notification that their information is incomplete, and that we need to call. Every time I call, the rep is unclear about what the actual issue is. Just about every time, they hazard a guess at what might be wrong, have us \\'fix\\' one thing, and then tell us that they think our transfer will probably go through soon. But every time, we get a near-identical notification the following week. The reps can never give us a complete list of what needs to be done on our end to complete the transfer. It seems like the various people working on the transfer don\\'t keep good notes; nobody knows what anybody else is doing.\\n\\nThis last week was the worst. We got another \"call us, there\\'s a problem\", notification. I called, and the rep said they couldn\\'t see any issues having to do with the account (just that there had been a fund transfer in process for 2 months). She claimed I had not actually received a notification to call them, because I did not have a reference number (the email had no reference number). \\n\\nI feel like their money is stuck in limbo. It would be a pain in the ass to go back to Primerica (and their funds are expensive), but I don\\'t see how the money is ever going to fully transfer to Vanguard.\\n\\nI wrote this as a cautionary tale; reddit salivates over this company, and while they must do some good things, their customer service has been confusingly awful. Considering the amount of money involved, I\\'m surprised and annoyed.

       "       'This is going to be long, but I really need some encouragement.\\n\\nI am a high school teacher from Delaware-- where I\\'ve lived my whole life. I worked at a particular school (in DE) for the past three years-- small private school, great kids, very progressive with tons of teacher autonomy, amazing co-workers, a classroom of my dreams, etc. I was in a very unique position where I was teaching two subjects I absolutely love-- English and History. More so, last year I started teaching my favorite subject (psychology). Not to brag but the kids in my psych class liked it so much and the enrollment tripled for this year. What was just one section became three sections, including an AP level class. Granted, not everything was great (the pay was nearly humiliating), but it was a great environment and I know that this school year would have been rewarding.\\n\\nAside from that, everything else in my home state was shit. I came home every day, took a nap, and then sat online until bed. Weekends were not much better. My SO and I were wasting away-- he hated his job, we did nothing aside from our predictable weekend dinner date to one of 3 restaurants we liked, I started gaining some weight, and the only joy I felt was when we would head to NYC to spend a weekend. Moving to NY was something we always talked about and it got to the point that he was ready to go-- I guess I was too, but he did not love his job like I did.\\n\\nHaving said this, at the end of last year, I decided to start applying for jobs in NY. Everyone told me I either wouldn\\'t get a teaching job or I\\'d be \"putting time in\" at some murderous public school-- well, I got a job offer at a reputable private school and he got a nice job with a big company. We found an apartment in our ideal area and everything just seemed like it was meant to be. I told myself that a job is just a job and that it was time for me to live my life. I felt I needed to get out of my small town while I was still young and, as much as I loved my job, my life was very dull and comfortably numb aside from that. I told myself that I did not want to look back at age 50 and wonder, \"What if...?\"\\n\\nHowever, now, I cannot get my old job out of my mind. I keep thinking about the kids I let down by leaving and about the ideal schedule I gave up. What if I never get to teach psychology again? I miss the kids, my colleagues, my classroom, my schedule...  I even think, every single day, about the lessons I would be doing and how much fun they were. I\\'m almost masochistic in a sense-- I look through my old files and keynotes, I go on my old school\\'s website and look at my past teaching pages, I even looked up rosters (I still have access to them) to see what students I would have. Obviously all of this makes things 10x worse. I\\'ve received emails from kids saying they miss me or how much they liked my class and, though it makes me so happy, it also makes me sad that I\\'m not still there for them. \\n\\nI also am just very afraid of the changes at this new school-- I have no classroom, it is all girls, it does not have the same tech my old school did, etc. I just keep obsessing over the job I gave up and thinking maybe I shouldn\\'t have left. While I am enjoying life here, maybe I left for the wrong reasons? However, maybe if I had stayed, I\\'d be regretting that choice even more.\\n\\nHow do I get this out of my head and move on? I don\\'t want to regret this forever.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nEdit: I should add that my new school has not started yet. Right now, I\\'m hoping that I\\'ll snap out of this funk once the year starts.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nEdit 2: I also want to add that I\\'m sorry if I sound like an asshole.

The pc just randomly locks up for 2-4 seconds, while the cpu is under load at Stock speeds (See orange lines during light gaming)\\n\\nhttps://i.redd.it/we4y5d7xdjj11.png\\n\\nTo add insult to injury,  The temps seem to be way off.  anything above 4.6Ghz(all core overclock) at 1.300V, under stress gives temperatures around the 97C mark (cpu and fpu stress test).\\n\\nAND if I dont force the cpu to keep its turbo at stock speeds. after 5 minutes it'll underclock to 3.6Ghz yet the thermals are 65C.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe only thing I havent tried yet is to do a system wipe / fresh windows install,  mostly because I have 4TB of work data. Secondly I kinda dont want to risk loosing my windows lisence as that shits expensive.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo....Can anyone shed some light on this as I have no ideas left if the problem is still happening at stock clocks (with the anti throttle enabled).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\nPre edit: I’ve got work in 4 hours so I’m going to bed.

The person driving is another employee in the mall. \\nI was reversing from a space and he was almost done driving behind me down the aisle when my rear driver’s side bumper hit his rear passenger side bumper. \\nThe damage was very minimal and my car took 99% of the damage (2001 Honda Civic vs a 2007 Chevy Suburban). I took photos of my car and stupidly didn’t take photos of his. \\nMy insurance isn’t covering the accident as there was a lapse in my coverage (I know, I know). \\nI told the gentleman I was happy to pay out of pocket for the damage my vehicle caused. \\nI get an invoice from the guy for $3,200 including repairs for damages that my car didn’t cause. \\nI’m feeling very, very stupid and stuck. \\n\\nEdit: in a nutshell, my question is this: his invoice shows costs for repairs I know I didn’t and couldn’t have caused (including a dent that existed beforehand and work on the roof). How can I only pay for what I caused? ',\n",
