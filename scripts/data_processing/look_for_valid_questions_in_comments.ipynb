Her costume was “The Great Dust Bowl” - she wore a tattered dress and covered herself in dirt and carried around a bowl filled with dust. I was “The Great Depression” and wore my old pill bottles around my neck with my pajamas on and a comfy blanket over my shoulders. Everyone at the party thought it was great, especially since they were mostly friends of ours who know my history struggling with anxiety and depression and how amazing my beautiful fiancé has been through it all. We looked at my costume as a funny way to celebrate how much better i am doing (no longer on a ton of medication, am happy and healthier than ever). But when she posted a photo of us on her instagram she got some flak for “making a joke out of depression.” I believe that comedy = tragedy + time, but was wondering what you all think. Am i the asshole? \\n\\nedit: WIBTA if i send the instagram haters a  link to this post, haha   \n",

I transferred the money to his bank account provided and sent through a screenshot of the receipt as usual. \\nUsually at this point the seller will post the item to me as that’s enough proof of transfer, but some don’t and want to see the money in their account before they post their item which is also fine. \\nAlthough, this guys claims he still hasn’t received my bank transfer 8 days later which is false.\\nI’ve tripled checked the bsb and account number I sent to and asked him to do the same that he provided me the right details. I’ve spoken to my bank and confirmed that the money has left my account and should be in his but he’s still denying he’s received anything.\\n\\nI’m wondering how I go about replying and attempting to recover my funds now. \\nDo I contact my police station? Do I call my banks fraud department?\\nI definitely won’t be as trusting on Facebook marketplace anymore.\\n\\nEDIT: I live in Australia   \n",

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\\n\\n*“But aren’t noncitizens not subject to the jurisdiction, and therefore this doesn’t apply to them?”*\\n\\nAlso no. The only people in America who aren’t subject to US jurisdiction are properly credentialed foreign diplomats. (edit: And in theory parents who were members of an occupying army who had their children in the US during the occupation).\\n\\n*“Can Trump amend the constitution to take this away?”*\\n\\nHe can try. But it requires 2/3 of both the House and Senate to vote in favor and then 3/4 of the states to ratify amendment. The moderators of legal advice, while not legislative experts, do not believe this is likely.\\n\\n*“So why did this come up now?”*\\n\\nProbably because there’s an election in a week. \\n\\nEDIT: *No serious academics or constitutional scholars take this position, however [there is debate](https://reason.com/volokh/2018/07/19/a-bad-argument-on-birthright-citizenship) on the far right wing of American politics that there is an alternative view to this argument. \\n\\nThe definitive case on this issue is [US v. Wong Kim Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark). Decided in 1898 it has been the law of the land for 120 years, barring a significant (and unexpected) narrowing of the ruling by the Supreme Court this is unlikely to change.    \n",

We flirt for a few weeks, bring each other snacks, talk alot. The usual. Valentine's day rolls around I ask her if she want to skip class and go for a drive. We do, get lost, and have a fantastic evening. We begin dating but only really meet during or after class. Due to her family having a chokehold on her. Theres alot I can't say but they tried to marry her to a 40y/o guy in Mexico when she was 6. And she always seemed like she was justifying everything her family did. Anyway this goes on for several months. \\n\\nMy parents go out of town and we decided to spend the night together. At arround 4 am we wake up to her phone ringing. It is her mother and she is screaming so loudly that i can hear it on the other side of the room. She wants her back home now. We comply and i drive her back home. Arriving at her home there is a police car outside and i brace for the worst. I am left in my car for 2 hours while they talk to her and her family. At they end of it they say I'm under arrest for sexual assault against her daughter. At this point I'm pretty confused and the officer says he can't tell me any more as it is an active investigation. They drive me to the sheriffs department and impound my car. I'm handcuffed to a wall in an interrogation room and left there for nearly 6 hours. During this time i am told they are speaking to my girlfriend in private away from her family. At the end of the 6 hours a detective comes in and un handcuffed me from the wall. I tell him everything that happened. He leaves and I am left alone for another few hours. The detective comes back and escorts me to my car gives me my keys and tells me  my gf liked me very much and didn't want to get me in trouble. And she has gone back home. They tell me I'm free to go but they may be in contact. \\n\\nAt this point I'm more confused than anything. And am kinda upset about being chained to a wall for most of this time. And am feeling multiple conflicting emotions. Was there something wrong done here or am I just crazy?\\n\\nI've been in contact with her a few times since, but she is saying her family forbids her from seeing me. I just feel lost right now. \\n \\nThere is alot more to this story, but I'm on mobile rn so I can edit when I get back home.\\n\\nEdit: Detroit MI   \n",

This new student says he has a mental condition( idk didn't really pay attention to that kind of stuff), but it really doesn't matter to me. So, all was going well for a couple of weeks until I started seeing him doing other devilish stuff around other people like snitching on people(claims its on accident), taking people stuff saying he didn't know, and just at random screaming like a banshee  at people for smacking or even just tapping their feet. People have been telling me he has a condition so they take up it up the ass and I don't really agree with that so i ry to stay clear of that person when possible.\\n\\n   So all was going well until I'm in the library about to go too class About to pick up my bag until I realise the new guy place his stuff around mines he was about to go as well so I just grab my bag and just trying to get out there. Then this the new guy grabbed my bag saying that is hes bad( granted our bag look the same but there is clear difference my bag has a medium size tear and hes doesnt). So Im telling him \"Look dude this has a huge tear I know yours doesn't now let go of my stuff.\", he told me to open it up I refused  then he started screaming trying to take my bad with him. So at this point I had enough of this bs and decided to punch him making him land right on his back. He started screaming and crying like like a little demon until teacher broke us up,   settled the situation and made us both open the bags too see if who was right(I was right).  Then the teacher asked who punch first the lil demon said I punched first it was true, but I did it becuase he was trying to steal my stuff. Short story after the teachers said  he has a mental condition and I should be more patience and more empathic. In my head I said fuck that this demon need  deserve what's coming to him. Now some people saying Im a jerk for doing that am I  jerk for standing up.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: I have been listening to others opinions and thoughts. I have come with my educated opinion that Iwas wrong and will try to day sorry and ask for forgiveness    \n",
       "85   My company has a 401k match. I noticed a few weeks ago that the match had not been applied the entire year (shame on me for not checking sooner). I asked the benefits team and I got an odd response. they say that because I started in 2017, the 2018 401k policy does not apply to me and that I must follow the 2017 401k standards and wait one year before getting the company match . The 2018 401k policy states that all employees get a company match immediately and that if you were hired prior to 2018 it is fully vested, otherwise it will take two years to vest. The issue that I have is that I was not eligible to start my 401k until 1/1/2018 AND the 2018 policy does not have any stipulation on eligibility other than you must be 21 and a full time employee, which I am.

She passed it but was still detained and taken to jail. She has yet to go before the judge, but she's been locked up for around 120 days because they keep moving her court date everytime it comes close. I don't have that much information because this is all I can get from phone calls she's occasionally allowed to have. I can try to press for more info but I doubt I'll get anything. She's taken multiple drug tests and has passed every single one. How long can they keep her like this?\\n\\nNotes:\\nMom DOES smoke and has smoked, even before I was born.\\n\\nI don't know who \"suspicious person\" is and neither does she.\\n\\nMom had a previous history of drugs (hell, I was an accidental child because of them) but she's been clean for a year and has visited rehab often.\\n\\nEDIT: She was on probation at one point, but isn't anymore, if that helps. She was arrested once for violation of probation.   \n",

They continued on saying that I can not use that language, I was confused because i dropped spik just seconds earlier(their were black people there) After class they said that I offended some people and I should not use that language.

       "374  I'm not unrealistic about my looks, I know I'm not a supermodel.  However I am in very good shape and I have a pretty face.  I used to be much more rigorous about working out, which has gone way down since I started my career. But I still stay in great shape and am slim.  BF is an extremely athletic guy, but I don't think he's more physically attractive than I am, just more fit.\\n\\nWe were drinking about a month ago, and I jokingly got him to rate me. I wasn't expecting him to say 8/10, but it kind of shocked me, as all my previous boyfriends have spoken to me as though I was the most beautiful woman and called me 10/10. It made me feel unique and wanted and it just felt good to hear that. In comparison, it hurt to learn that my current bf doesn't feel that way.\\n\\nI stewed on it for a month, then last night I decided not to bottle up my feelings anymore and told him how I felt when I first heard it. He again confirmed that he thinks I am 8/10 in the looks category, but that I \"make up for it by being 12/10 everywhere else.\"  I really didn't know what to make of that. I have just opened up to him explaining it hurts me and he just confirms what he said? I didn't know how to talk to him about it, so I kind of clammed up and was distant for the rest of the evening. He kept trying to talk to me, and I just kept telling him it made me feel bad, but he never took it back.\\n\\nI just want him to tell me I am 10/10 in his eyes, even if it's not true. AITA?\\n\\nTl:dr:  BF told me I am 8/10 after some prompting from me, it hurt my feelings, I stewed on it and brought it up again to tell him how I feel, he confirmed I am 8/10 to him and now I am hurt and distant but honest with him about why I'm being this way.\\n\\nEdit: I hope he doesn't see this. It will be awkward. Taking the chance anyway, Reddit, judge away.\\n\\nEdit 2: Starting to look like I am the asshole. Open to suggestions on how to fix this or not be an asshole. The relationship is important to me but have I damaged it permanently?\\n\\nEdit 3: Final update, I told him the truth and apologized as per your suggestions. I said I love him and I know I'm being stupid about a small thing but that was how I feel. He used the words \"You are 10/10 in my eyes\" so I guess I finally got what I wanted, but I don't feel good about it because of how I treated him. So I apologized again, for making a big deal out of it and bringing it up in the first place and being cold about it last night. Thank you all for giving your...   \n",

I thought that it was a good thing to do and (of course), needed money at the time. I’m still glad that I did it, but they contacted me through Facebook, and forced pictures on me. It has been traumatic for my partner and I, and I want to do something about it. Any ideas? \\n\\nEdit: this was at a well-known “international sperm and egg bank” in NYC. Also, those of you saying to just block, that doesn’t rectify violating an agreement.    \n",

Her costume was “The Great Dust Bowl” - she wore a tattered dress and covered herself in dirt and carried around a bowl filled with dust. I was “The Great Depression” and wore my old pill bottles around my neck with my pajamas on and a comfy blanket over my shoulders. Everyone at the party thought it was great, especially since they were mostly friends of ours who know my history struggling with anxiety and depression and how amazing my beautiful fiancé has been through it all. We looked at my costume as a funny way to celebrate how much better i am doing (no longer on a ton of medication, am happy and healthier than ever). But when she posted a photo of us on her instagram she got some flak for “making a joke out of depression.” I believe that comedy = tragedy + time, but was wondering what you all think. Am i the asshole? \\n  \n",

After buying and selling a lot ive become pretty trusting in the buyer/seller as I’ve never had any issues until now.\\n\\nI went about buying some Apple AirPods for $160 of this seller. I transferred the money to his bank account provided and sent through a screenshot of the receipt as usual. \\nUsually at this point the seller will post the item to me as that’s enough proof of transfer, but some don’t and want to see the money in their account before they post their item which is also fine. \\nAlthough, this guys claims he still hasn’t received my bank transfer 8 days later which is false.\\nI’ve tripled checked the bsb and account number I sent to and asked him to do the same that he provided me the right details.

We flirt for a few weeks, bring each other snacks, talk alot. The usual. Valentine's day rolls around I ask her if she want to skip class and go for a drive. We do, get lost, and have a fantastic evening. We begin dating but only really meet during or after class. Due to her family having a chokehold on her. Theres alot I can't say but they tried to marry her to a 40y/o guy in Mexico when she was 6. And she always seemed like she was justifying everything her family did. Anyway this goes on for several months. \\n\\nMy parents go out of town and we decided to spend the night together. At arround 4 am we wake up to her phone ringing. It is her mother and she is screaming so loudly that i can hear it on the other side of the room. She wants her back home now. We comply and i drive her back home. Arriving at her home there is a police car outside and i brace for the worst. I am left in my car for 2 hours while they talk to her and her family. At they end of it they say I'm under arrest for sexual assault against her daughter. At this point I'm pretty confused and the officer says he can't tell me any more as it is an active investigation. They drive me to the sheriffs department and impound my car. I'm handcuffed to a wall in an interrogation room and left there for nearly 6 hours. During this time i am told they are speaking to my girlfriend in private away from her family. At the end of the 6 hours a detective comes in and un handcuffed me from the wall. I tell him everything that happened. He leaves and I am left alone for another few hours. The detective comes back and escorts me to my car gives me my keys and tells me  my gf liked me very much and didn't want to get me in trouble. And she has gone back home. They tell me I'm free to go but they may be in contact. \\n\\nAt this point I'm more confused than anything. And am kinda upset about being chained to a wall for most of this time. And am feeling multiple conflicting emotions. Was there something wrong done here or am I just crazy?\\n\\nI've been in contact with her a few times since, but she is saying her family forbids her from seeing me. I just feel lost right now. \\n \\nThere is alot more to this story, but I'm on mobile rn so I can edit when I get back home.\\n  \n",

This new student says he has a mental condition( idk didn't really pay attention to that kind of stuff), but it really doesn't matter to me. So, all was going well for a couple of weeks until I started seeing him doing other devilish stuff around other people like snitching on people(claims its on accident), taking people stuff saying he didn't know, and just at random screaming like a banshee  at people for smacking or even just tapping their feet. People have been telling me he has a condition so they take up it up the ass and I don't really agree with that so i ry to stay clear of that person when possible.\\n\\n   So all was going well until I'm in the library about to go too class About to pick up my bag until I realise the new guy place his stuff around mines he was about to go as well so I just grab my bag and just trying to get out there. Then this the new guy grabbed my bag saying that is hes bad( granted our bag look the same but there is clear difference my bag has a medium size tear and hes doesnt). So Im telling him \"Look dude this has a huge tear I know yours doesn't now let go of my stuff.\", he told me to open it up I refused  then he started screaming trying to take my bad with him. So at this point I had enough of this bs and decided to punch him making him land right on his back. He started screaming and crying like like a little demon until teacher broke us up,   settled the situation and made us both open the bags too see if who was right(I was right).  Then the teacher asked who punch first the lil demon said I punched first it was true, but I did it becuase he was trying to steal my stuff. Short story after the teachers said  he has a mental condition and I should be more patience and more empathic. In my head I said fuck that this demon need  deserve what's coming to him. Now some people saying Im a jerk for doing that am I  jerk for standing up.\\n\\n\\n  \n",
       "85   My company has a 401k match. I noticed a few weeks ago that the match had not been applied the entire year (shame on me for not checking sooner). I asked the benefits team and I got an odd response. they say that because I started in 2017, the 2018 401k policy does not apply to me and that I must follow the 2017 401k standards and wait one year before getting the company match . The 2018 401k policy states that all employees get a company match immediately and that if you were hired prior to 2018 it is fully vested, otherwise it will take two years to vest. The issue that I have is that I was not eligible to start my 401k until 1/1/2018 AND the 2018 policy does not have any stipulation on eligibility other than you must be 21 and a full time employee, which I am.

I have just opened up to him explaining it hurts me and he just confirms what he said? I didn't know how to talk to him about it, so I kind of clammed up and was distant for the rest of the evening. He kept trying to talk to me, and I just kept telling him it made me feel bad, but he never took it back.\\n\\nI just want him to tell me I am 10/10 in his eyes, even if it's not true. AITA?\\n\\nTl:dr:  BF told me I am 8/10 after some prompting from me, it hurt my feelings, I stewed on it and brought it up again to tell him how I feel, he confirmed I am 8/10 to him and now I am hurt and distant but honest with him about why I'm being this way.\\n\\n\\nEdit 2: Starting to look like I am the asshole. Open to suggestions on how to fix this or not be an asshole. The relationship is important to me but have I damaged it permanently?\\n\\nEdit 3: Final update, I told him the truth and apologized as per your suggestions. I said I love him and I know I'm being stupid about a small thing but that was how I feel. He used the words \"You are 10/10 in my eyes\" so I guess I finally got what I wanted, but I don't feel good about it because of how I treated him. So I apologized again, for making a big deal out of it and bringing it up in the first place and being cold about it last night. Thank you all for giving your perspective.  \n",

I thought that it was a good thing to do and (of course), needed money at the time. I’m still glad that I did it, but they contacted me through Facebook, and forced pictures on me. It has been traumatic for my partner and I, and I want to do something about it. Any ideas? \\n  "

The woman on the phone told me I can switch to AT&amp;amp;T and they would pay my early termination fee (ETF) from Verizon and not charge any activation fees. I asked if I needed to trade in my phones for the ETF to be paid, and she assured me that I would not. My AT&amp;amp;T bill includes $100 of activation fees, and when I submitted my Verizon bill to be processed to get the ETF credited, they denied my request. I called customer service to clear this up, and they credited me for the activation fee, but refuse to do so for the $880 ETF. I escalated to a manager and she told me there is nothing they can do as it is actually a third party that handles the ETF, and that I needed to trade in my phone, even though the original person I spoke with said otherwise. She then gave me an address for some \"correspondents' department\" to write them a written complaint to look into the matter, which I will be doing. I will also be filing a complaint with the FCC and the Bureau of Consumer Protection, and the Florida State Attorney General, but I am worried this won't do anything since the consumer agreement has a binding arbitration clause. Any advice on how to handle this would be much appreciated, thank you in advance.</td>\n",

I recently purchased a new car with the help of my mom on the loan. I pay about $690 a month. My insurance is $113 a month as well. In addition, my gas is about $60 per full tank and that typically lasts me about a week sometimes more. So monthly, I’d say I spend about $300 on gas at the most. Those are my current expenses as of now. \\n\\nI just graduated from nursing school and am currently waiting to test for licensure. \\n\\nI recently applied for my first credit card at the age of 23. I was approved for a Costco citi credit card with a limit of $5000. My loan approval stated my credit score was 823 although when I was trying to purchase my car, it said it was 706. I’m not sure which it is and if it isn’t obvious, I’m a little inexperienced. \\n\\nI make $25 an hour working 40 hours a week. Sometimes 32. I started this job in April 2017. At the time, I only had $3k total (checking and savings). Since I started working there (my first job as well), I now have 10k in my savings and about 3k in my checking (I did have to cut back on hours with school) Before I had the expenses (car and insurance), I was transferring about half of my paycheck into my savings. Since I started doing that, I have not touched my savings account at all. \\n\\nI have Mint to help me budget although I have some technical difficulties as my Bank of America is added, my other account (Orange County CU) can’t be added. I’m trying to sort that out with them. I have not received my credit card yet.\\n\\nI would like some advice on budgeting. But also, what can I expect with living on my own. I do have a bf that I plan to move in with very, very soon (as in a day after I move out). I just want to be aware of all the expenses without a SO/Roommate. Our ideal plan is to have both our names on the lease but I just want to prepare myself (and bank account) of the typical cost with or without a roommate.\\n\\nI would ideally like to not touch my savings at this time but I understand if I have to. I know that I will have to be purchasing some furniture as the only furniture I have is whatever is in my room. But am I crazy for taking this step? I know I shouldn’t rely on anyone but myself but I do know my SO can help me out. (We have been together for 3 years and moving in together is our next step). but like I said, I’d like to be aware of the cost in case anything happens. \\n\\nI know I’d like to have enough in my account to make sure I can make it in the case I get in an accident and am unable to work. So again, I’d like an idea of typical cost for living on your own. \\n\\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!</td>\n",

Meaning you give $1000, they give $500. There is no match after that. They make one single $500 deposit on the 31st of December.\\n\\n\\nThe plan is through Ascensus, and has some decent options and low expenses compared to some of what I've seen here. I've got about $28k in the account, after about 19 months of contributions. I contribute 12%, which is about $12,000/yr right now. My funds are allocated between some blue chip stock funds with low-ish expense ratios around 0.2%, and a growth strategy fund that's at 0.33%. 2017 was my first full calendar year in the plan, and i was very impressed with my return of 27.2% and expenses of 0.3%.\\n\\n\\nThe employer match has me feeling like I may be wasting time with it, but the returns and seemingly average expenses keep me in it. I can't afford to up my contributions at this time(kids are expensive) but I'm finding myself yearning for the employer match at my old company, which was 100% match to 6%, 50% match to 18%.\\n\\nIs it worth investing my money elsewhere?    \n",

The woman on the phone told me I can switch to AT&amp;T and they would pay my early termination fee (ETF) from Verizon and not charge any activation fees. I asked if I needed to trade in my phones for the ETF to be paid, and she assured me that I would not. My AT&amp;T bill includes $100 of activation fees, and when I submitted my Verizon bill to be processed to get the ETF credited, they denied my request. I called customer service to clear this up, and they credited me for the activation fee, but refuse to do so for the $880 ETF. I escalated to a manager and she told me there is nothing they can do as it is actually a third party that handles the ETF, and that I needed to trade in my phone, even though the original person I spoke with said otherwise. She then gave me an address for some \"correspondents' department\" to write them a written complaint to look into the matter, which I will be doing. I will also be filing a complaint with the FCC and the Bureau of Consumer Protection, and the Florida State Attorney General, but I am worried this won't do anything since the consumer agreement has a binding arbitration clause. Any advice on how to handle this would be much appreciated, thank you in advance.   \n",
       "2  I live in south OC but I need to move out of my parents place within the next month or so. What expenses should I be prepared for? \\n\\nCurrently, I have a car payment. I recently purchased a new car with the help of my mom on the loan. I pay about $690 a month. My insurance is $113 a month as well. In addition, my gas is about $60 per full tank and that typically lasts me about a week sometimes more. So monthly, I’d say I spend about $300 on gas at the most. Those are my current expenses as of now. \\n\\nI just graduated from nursing school and am currently waiting to test for licensure. \\n\\nI recently applied for my first credit card at the age of 23. I was approved for a Costco citi credit card with a limit of $5000. My loan approval stated my credit score was 823 although when I was trying to purchase my car, it said it was 706. I’m not sure which it is and if it isn’t obvious, I’m a little inexperienced. \\n\\nI make $25 an hour working 40 hours a week. Sometimes 32. I started this job in April 2017. At the time, I only had $3k total (checking and savings). Since I started working there (my first job as well), I now have 10k in my savings and about 3k in my checking (I did have to cut back on hours with school) Before I had the expenses (car and insurance), I was transferring about half of my paycheck into my savings. Since I started doing that, I have not touched my savings account at all. \\n\\nI have Mint to help me budget although I have some technical difficulties as my Bank of America is added, my other account (Orange County CU) can’t be added. I’m trying to sort that out with them. I have not received my credit card yet.\\n\\nI would like some advice on budgeting. But also, what can I expect with living on my own. I do have a bf that I plan to move in with very, very soon (as in a day after I move out). I just want to be aware of all the expenses without a SO/Roommate. Our ideal plan is to have both our names on the lease but I just want to prepare myself (and bank account) of the typical cost with or without a roommate.\\n\\nI would ideally like to not touch my savings at this time but I understand if I have to. I know that I will have to be purchasing some furniture as the only furniture I have is whatever is in my room. But am I crazy for taking this step? I know I shouldn’t rely on anyone but myself but I do know my SO can help me out. (We have been together for 3 years and moving in together is our next step). but like I said, I’d like to be aware of the cost in case anything happens. \\n\\nI know I’d like to have enough in my account to make sure I can make it in the case I get in an accident and am unable to work. So again, I’d like an idea of typical cost for living on your own. \\n\\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!   \n",

However in Mass Section Laws, Chapter 369 from the year of 2012 acts, it says a medical patient can have up to a 60 day supply. If I have a medical card and have, let's say, 2OZ for personal use. Can I legally have it seized and receive a fine for it, or am I covered under the act from 2012? \"A qualifying patient or a personal caregiver shall not be subject to arrest or prosecution, or civil penalty, for the medical use of marijuana provided he or she:\\n(a) Possesses no more marijuana than is necessary for the patient's personal, medical use, not exceeding the amount necessary for a sixty-day supply; and (b) Presents his or her registration card to any law enforcement official who questions the patient or caregiver regarding use of marijuana.\" mentions there should not be a civil penalty, but no mention of forfeiture.\\n\\nLaws:\\n\\nhttps://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter94G/Section7\\n\\nhttps://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2012/Chapter369\\n\\nIn Massachusetts   \n",

       "2  i live in south oc but i need to move out of my parents place within the next month or so. what expenses should i be prepared for? \\n\\ncurrently, i have a car payment. i recently purchased a new car with the help of my mom on the loan. i pay about $690 a month. my insurance is $113 a month as well. in addition, my gas is about $60 per full tank and that typically lasts me about a week sometimes more. so monthly, i’d say i spend about $300 on gas at the most. those are my current expenses as of now. \\n\\ni just graduated from nursing school and am currently waiting to test for licensure. \\n\\ni recently applied for my first credit card at the age of 23. i was approved for a costco citi credit card with a limit of $5000. my loan approval stated my credit score was 823 although when i was trying to purchase my car, it said it was 706. i’m not sure which it is and if it isn’t obvious, i’m a little inexperienced. \\n\\ni make $25 an hour working 40 hours a week. sometimes 32. i started this job in april 2017. at the time, i only had $3k total (checking and savings). since i started working there (my first job as well), i now have 10k in my savings and about 3k in my checking (i did have to cut back on hours with school) before i had the expenses (car and insurance), i was transferring about half of my paycheck into my savings. since i started doing that, i have not touched my savings account at all. \\n\\ni have mint to help me budget although i have some technical difficulties as my bank of america is added, my other account (orange county cu) can’t be added. i’m trying to sort that out with them. i have not received my credit card yet.\\n\\ni would like some advice on budgeting. but also, what can i expect with living on my own. i do have a bf that i plan to move in with very, very soon (as in a day after i move out). i just want to be aware of all the expenses without a so/roommate. our ideal plan is to have both our names on the lease but i just want to prepare myself (and bank account) of the typical cost with or without a roommate.\\n\\ni would ideally like to not touch my savings at this time but i understand if i have to. i know that i will have to be purchasing some furniture as the only furniture i have is whatever is in my room. but am i crazy for taking this step? i know i shouldn’t rely on anyone but myself but i do know my so can help me out. (we have been together for 3 years and moving in together is our next step). but like i said, i’d like to be aware of the cost in case anything happens. \\n\\ni know i’d like to have enough in my account to make sure i can make it in the case i get in an accident and am unable to work. so again, i’d like an idea of typical cost for living on your own. \\n\\nany advice is greatly appreciated. thank you!  \n",

(to be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, i did not. she was projecting.) as a result, as i have now learned, my legitimate relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. this also includes people who i excitedly called after getting engaged and people that i had offered positions in my wedding party to. to make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance. \\n\\ni feel so betrayed by this friend that i can't imagine ever reconciling. i am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if i'm overreacting to average workplace drama. \\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>within the last few months, i have come to the realization that it is time to make a very drastic change in my life and move away from my lovely state of illinois. this has come after living and breathing the small town midwestern lifestyle for my entire life and absolutely coming to resent it. this is especially true during the winter times where everything in the area turns lifeless, cold, and gray for months on end. the grass, the trees, the people. i don't know why anyone would actively choose to continue living here with its lack of stimulating scenery, lifestyle, and topography. i have had serious bouts of depression throughout the previous winters living here and this winter hit me incredibly hard. to be frank about it, i don't think i can make it through another year stuck in this place.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200b;\\n\\nwith that being said, i need help. serious help. i have been obsessing for the last month about where exactly i want to move to in this beautiful country and....well i have gotten almost nowhere meaningful.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200b;\\n\\nsome stats about me:\\n\\n\\-**22m**\\n\\n**-able to afford up to \\~950/month for apartment (just me and the cat so 1br or studio is ideal)**\\n\\n**-hates long cold winters**\\n\\n**-physically distressed by the sight of cornfields**\\n\\n**-major outdoor enthusiast**\\n\\n**-curious about city life**\\n\\n**-prefers commuting by bicycle whenever possible but does own car.**\\n\\n \\n\\nhere's my list of top qualities contenders so far and their biggest draws and flaws as i see them:\\n\\n\\-**colorado springs, co**\\n\\n**draw**: outdoor person's paradise/cheap cost-of-living   **flaw**: cold midwest winters as usual\\n\\n\\-**denver, co**\\n\\n**draw**: city living/fairly outdoorsy    **flaw**: cold winters/high cost-of-living\\n\\n\\-**tampa, fl**\\n\\n**draw**: great weather/cheap(ish) cost-of-living   **flaw**: hurricanes might destroy my house in the future/not bike   \\nfriendly\\n\\n\\-**austin, tx**\\n\\n**draw**: no winter weather!/city living    **flaw**: not very outdoorsy/ apparently very hot/humid in the summers\\n\\n\\-**los angeles, ca (thrown in as a pipe dream)**\\n\\n**draw:** great weather, city living    **flaw:** wildly prohibitive cost-of-living\\n\\n it seems that everywhere that i have looked to as a possibility has had at least one major downside. i totally get that these draws and flaws are not all on equal footing and even from writing this, i have helped myself getting a bit of a better understanding of what exactly is keeping me from making a decision.\\n\\ni'm looking for advice from any redditors who have lived in the cities mentioned above. what was/is your experience in your city and do you think it would be a good match for me? are there any misconceptions about your city that i may have gotten wrong? also, if you live in a city that i didn't mention but think it should make my list, please let me know! i'm really open here folks and i have a few more weeks to really nail down a destination so please any advice you can spare would be much appreciated. thanks!!!</td>\n",

       "      <td>i (f30) manage about a dozen software developers (mostly middle-aged men). the software is rather large and complex, so there are times when it can take several days or even weeks to resolve an issue. other issues can be resolved in a matter of minutes. so it's quite difficult to tell how much time i should allow for bug-fixing assignments, although the client managers of course always ask for this information so they can set expectations for the clients. new development projects are easier to pinpoint a level of effort (in time), but even then it can be challenging to ensure these guys stay on the rather liberal target they're given. i walk around the office occasionally to chat about this or that, and i often see reddit or other time-sucking sites up on these guys' screens. sometimes i playfully jab \"that's not work\"...\"i see you over there\"...or something along those lines. but it's easy to say they are just taking a few minutes to refresh their mind or whatever. and i get that, after all, i'm here, aren't i? i don't want to be a stickler. i'm okay with slacking off to a degree...the amount of deep thought that's required for some of the things we do means (imo) that it's okay to balance the load with light-hearted internet fun. but some of these guys are taking it too far. if i walk by 6 times throughout the day and every time someone is doing not-work...then i seriously doubt i'm getting even a half day's work out of them. what i think should take a day or less to resolve takes 3 days...and now i have to deal with a pissed off client manager. so i'm looking for advice from other development managers or anyone who can offer tips or methods to encourage these guys to slack off less...</td>\n",

       "      <td>my little sister (14) has been dealing- she admitted to weed, molly, and lsd, but i wouldn't be surprised if she was involved with harder drugs, and hanging out with an older girl who is an underage prostitute (17). she told me that this girl asked her to work for her, opening the door for people and letting her \"do the rest\". \\n\\na little backstory: my sister has had a rough time growing up. our parents had an ugly divorce when she was little, and our dad was horribly manipulative. he would shower her in gifts, then tell her she was trying to ruin his life and ignore her for months. she had to deal with years of emotional abuse from him (and his shitty girlfriend) which all came to a head when he rejected her on his deathbed. my mom feels guilty about leaving my dad; she thinks his treatment of my sister is due to her ending the relationship, and babies her because shes worried about her mental health. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200b;\\n\\nwe've tried being strict, having an open conversation, and nothing gets through to her. i hoped that she would be able to work through things, but it's gotten to the point that i have to intervene. i'm considering speaking with law enforcement, and asking for advise. my worry is that getting the law involved could make things worse. here's how i see it playing out: \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200b;\\n\\ni speak to the police and: \\n\\n1- she ends up in trouble, and is 'scared straight'\\n\\n2- she ends up in trouble, and gets worse\\n\\n3- any colourful characters that she's involved with think she ratted them out, which puts her and possibly my family in danger (i wouldn't be surprised if she's involved with gang members)\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200b;\\n\\ni stay quiet and: \\n\\n1- this is all a horrible phase that she ends up working through down the road\\n\\n2- she remains involved in drugs and prostitution \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200b;\\n\\ni know my mom will stick by her, and ruin her life trying to protect her, so i feel the responsibility to do something. i'm looking for advice from people who have been my sister, or know someone who went through something similar. \\n\\ndo i turn my sister in, or wait it out and hope that things get better? i know by acting, i risk ruining my relationship with her and my mom, but it's worth it if it results in her turning things around. \\n\\nserious responses only, please. if there's a better sub-reddit for this, please let me know. \\n\\nthanks in advance.\\n\\nedit: a few people have brought up how this would result in a record for her, and that family shouldn't be thrown under the bus. i want to make it clear that this is a last resort for me. i'm trying to come up with alternate ideas for helping my sister, which is why i'm here. i'm not a \"golden boy\". i've fucked up too, but i refuse to let my sister start down a path that will likely screw up her life.</td>\n",

(to be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, i did not. she was projecting.) as a result, as i have now learned, my legitimate relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. this also includes people who i excitedly called after getting engaged and people that i had offered positions in my wedding party to. to make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance. \\n\\ni feel so betrayed by this friend that i can't imagine ever reconciling. i am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if i'm overreacting to average workplace drama. \\n\\n  \n",

       "505205  within the last few months, i have come to the realization that it is time to make a very drastic change in my life and move away from my lovely state of illinois. this has come after living and breathing the small town midwestern lifestyle for my entire life and absolutely coming to resent it. this is especially true during the winter times where everything in the area turns lifeless, cold, and gray for months on end. the grass, the trees, the people. i don't know why anyone would actively choose to continue living here with its lack of stimulating scenery, lifestyle, and topography. i have had serious bouts of depression throughout the previous winters living here and this winter hit me incredibly hard. to be frank about it, i don't think i can make it through another year stuck in this place.\\n\\n&amp;#x200b;\\n\\nwith that being said, i need help. serious help. i have been obsessing for the last month about where exactly i want to move to in this beautiful country and....well i have gotten almost nowhere meaningful.\\n\\n&amp;#x200b;\\n\\nsome stats about me:\\n\\n\\-**22m**\\n\\n**-able to afford up to \\~950/month for apartment (just me and the cat so 1br or studio is ideal)**\\n\\n**-hates long cold winters**\\n\\n**-physically distressed by the sight of cornfields**\\n\\n**-major outdoor enthusiast**\\n\\n**-curious about city life**\\n\\n**-prefers commuting by bicycle whenever possible but does own car.**\\n\\n \\n\\nhere's my list of top qualities contenders so far and their biggest draws and flaws as i see them:\\n\\n\\-**colorado springs, co**\\n\\n**draw**: outdoor person's paradise/cheap cost-of-living   **flaw**: cold midwest winters as usual\\n\\n\\-**denver, co**\\n\\n**draw**: city living/fairly outdoorsy    **flaw**: cold winters/high cost-of-living\\n\\n\\-**tampa, fl**\\n\\n**draw**: great weather/cheap(ish) cost-of-living   **flaw**: hurricanes might destroy my house in the future/not bike   \\nfriendly\\n\\n\\-**austin, tx**\\n\\n**draw**: no winter weather!/city living    **flaw**: not very outdoorsy/ apparently very hot/humid in the summers\\n\\n\\-**los angeles, ca (thrown in as a pipe dream)**\\n\\n**draw:** great weather, city living    **flaw:** wildly prohibitive cost-of-living\\n\\n it seems that everywhere that i have looked to as a possibility has had at least one major downside. i totally get that these draws and flaws are not all on equal footing and even from writing this, i have helped myself getting a bit of a better understanding of what exactly is keeping me from making a decision.\\n\\ni'm looking for advice from any redditors who have lived in the cities mentioned above. what was/is your experience in your city and do you think it would be a good match for me? are there any misconceptions about your city that i may have gotten wrong? also, if you live in a city that i didn't mention but think it should make my list, please let me know! i'm really open here folks and i have a few more weeks to really nail down a destination so please any advice you can spare would be much appreciated. thanks!!!  \n",

       "      <td>hello,\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200b;\\n\\ni'm looking for advice from a adult entertainment lawyer. me (a woman) and a group of friends want to start a porn website and business. the model we're leaning with for right now is cam girls and then we'd like to transition into shooting our own videos once we get some revenue. we know all about appearance releases and making sure everyone's over 18. we know about the health law of using condoms as it's required in ca. we have the website and a webmaster. we are going to start a corp as we were told we're more protected if we do so. we were also told to do a trademark because of the niche type of porn we're trying to do so that's the plans. now for my questions. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200b;\\n\\nwe live in simi valley, is it all right to put down the business address there or should we get a p.o. box in la, say fernando valley, (i know there's lots of companies there so it's not banned)? and use that as our business address? we don't know about the zoning laws. another question, is it wise to put porn in our company name? or should that be avoided? we were also thinking about maybe doing a business deal with a company that's been in the business like say vivid but we also don't wanna be pushed out so we're  little skeptic of that right now, perhaps once we gain a following we'd be more comfortable doing that. is that a good idea now or later?\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200b;\\n\\nis there anything else we should know before going live? i did hear about \"guys in black vans\" running the industry so i'm a little off put by that but i believe we can all get along so we're gonna move forward. thank you for your responses.</td>\n",

       "467785  my father passed away in 2017 minnesota with a will that was about 15 years old. he designated one of his friends at the current time as the personal representative. once my father passed, the pr was a bit surprised that he was the pr, given that he hasn't spoken to my father is sometimes, and stated that his health wasn't up to the task. given that i'm the only next of kin, i thought maybe i could help in the process.\\n\\nwhen the time came for my dad's friend to state to the court he did want to be the pr, he had a change of heart. the reason why is unknown because he refuses to talk to me. he has hired a lawyer to handle the fully handle the estate and has requested that all communication goes through the lawyer.\\n\\nthe lawyer was usually okay about giving status updates, usually about once every month as long i request one via email. as of the last update in december, he stated that he was nearly done with the estate and would begin wrapping up.\\n\\ni have been since requesting an update from the lawyer since mid-january. i have sent three emails and have made three phone calls. all the phone calls \"he's heading to into a closing\" or \"just walked into a meeting\" with the promise of a return call which never arrives.\\n\\nin the beginning, when things went weird with my dad's friend, i hired a lawyer and gave a retainer. about six months into the estate, the lawyer quit his firm and returned about 20% of the retainer and did nothing more, as far as i can tell than send a few emails. many hours were racked up due to research and coordinating with the prs lawyer.\\n\\ni'm looking for advice from this community on how to encourage the “friend” and lawyer to provide an update. it's not a huge estate, and i'm looking to spend thousands on another retainer. \\n\\nthanks for reading my message!  \n",

       "      <td>hi pcmr!\\n\\ni've been struggling for a while (a few years, really) to find a mouse that i really like. i've tried over a dozen mice, and none of them feel completely \"right\" to me. instead of continuing the cycle of buying a mouse and returning it after a few days of trying to ignore the things i don't like, i'm looking for advice from those of you who may have similar preferences or experience. this may be kind of a long post, so i thank you for taking the time to read and offer any opinions.\\n\\n**my grip type:**\\n\\ni play with what i can most closely equate to a combination of part fingertip grip and part palm grip, but i am not sure if this is a product of using the wrong mouse for a long time, or if it's just how i naturally use the mouse. i find myself using my thumb and ring/pinky fingers to hold and move the mouse by the sides, with my palm almost cradling the very back of the mouse. my fingers lay more flat across the mouse than a claw grip, so i'm kind of \"choked\" down on the mouse more towards the back, and because i have maybe smaller than average hands (i am female, so comparing to what i assume is the majority/target audience for gaming mice being the average male sized hand) but not completely flat like a palm grip. \\n\\n**what i play:**\\n\\ni play a variety of games from mmorpgs to mobas to fps, and use varying dpi settings across these games (ranging from 4500-9000). i prefer a hard style mat, as most mice seem to slide easier for me on this surface, and allow me quick movement without having to move my whole arm/wrist or even my palm on higher dpi settings.\\n\\n**what i like/dislike in a mouse:**\\n\\n* i generally prefer a bigger/fuller mouse to a smaller mouse. \\n* i also prefer a mouse that has a taller/more pronounced palm area, as it tends to feel better under my palm/heel of my hand, even though i barely touch that area of the mouse. \\n* i do like the mice that have the little kind of lip on the left side for the thumb, but i don't find myself missing it when i'm using a mouse that doesn't have it, either.\\n* i would prefer a few extra buttons in addition to the typical two on the left side of the mouse\\n* wireless/wired isn't really a factor in my choice. wireless might be nice, but usually adds a lot in price.\\n\\n**mice i have tried:**\\n\\ni'll start with the more recent and go backwards as far as i can remember:\\n\\n* razer basilisk - had positive reviews and seemed to have a few features i was looking for. i liked the dpi shift button (though i would use it for other binds or macros) and the thumb cradle thing, but it felt small and kind of cheap, and the left and right click buttons were noticeably a harder click than any mouse i can recall using.\\n\\n* logitech g502 hero - loved the extra buttons at first and adjustable scroll wheel, but the mouse felt too long and narrow. i thought i would like the extra buttons along the edge of the left click, but i found them to be too close, and more than once hit them accidentally\\n\\n* razer mamba elite - this is my current mouse, as i returned both of the other two. i like this mouse the most of the rest that i have tried, but i wish it had more buttons and maybe a fuller feeling grip. it just doesn't feel perfect.\\n\\n* corsair glaive - i liked this a lot too, at first. i liked being able to swap the thumb rest part on the left size, and the palm area felt full in my hand, but my ring and pinky finger felt uncomfortable on the side, and after about an hour of gaming my hand started to cramp. additionally, i found the icue software to be buggy and laggy\\n\\n* razer trinity naga - this is the mouse my husband currently uses. i love the idea of being able to swap the side buttons easily, and more importantly, i love the shape of the palm area - this is the only mouse that fills my palm for my grip style! but the pink rest on the right side drives me nuts. i didn't like that the 12 button attachment has no differing textures or anything on the buttons to help orient where your thumb is, and it makes it difficult to know what button you're pressing, defeating the purpose. the moba option is probably my favorite of the three, but i don't care for the buttons being in a circular layout.\\n\\n* razer lancehead te - i had this because i liked the pure white set up, but i hated this mouse. it was too small, the ambidextrous shape was almost painful to hold, and i couldn't game for more than an hour at a time without literal hand cramping. i did like the buttons on the side as well as the left.\\n\\n* steelseries sensei 310 - feels too small and did not like the ambidextrous symmetry\\n\\n* razer deathadder - this has long been a fan favorite, and i didn't hate it, but i didn't love it. it just didn't feel right in my hand, and i can't recall exactly what it was at this point.\\n\\n* razer naga hex (v1) - this was one of those old ones with the shiny grip, and i hated the glossy plastic feel.\\n\\nprior to that, i used a variety of logitech or whatever mice, not r...</td>\n",

current system.  i currently play in 1080p up to 144hz when possible, but my ultimate goal is to eventually get a 1440p/144hz monitor, and i want my future upgraded pc to be able to achieve that.\\n\\ni just bought a prebuilt from canada computers. it came with the following:\\n\\n1. i5 7400\\n2. gtx 1060 3gb\\n3. 1x8gb ddr4 @ 2133mhz\\n4. 256gb adaa ssd\\n5. 1tb hdd @ 7200 rpm\\n6. ** gigabyte mb with only 2 ram slots, no oc capability, and only 1 pci express 16x connector**\\n\\ni was going to do what my friend did, and just eventually swap out my cpu for another 7th gen (i7 7700) and change to a gtx 1080 or 1080ti.\\n\\ni'm also considering changing my mobo and cpu to an 8th set up with oc capability, instead of staying 7th gen.\\n\\nbasically i don't know what to do, and in what order i should do it.\\n\\ni'm looking for advice from more experienced builders who will be able to tell me what will be the smartest thing to do to balance longevity and value.  \\n\\nany input is greatly appreciated.\\n  \n",

       "448031  hi pcmr!\\n\\ni've been struggling for a while (a few years, really) to find a mouse that i really like. i've tried over a dozen mice, and none of them feel completely \"right\" to me. instead of continuing the cycle of buying a mouse and returning it after a few days of trying to ignore the things i don't like, i'm looking for advice from those of you who may have similar preferences or experience. this may be kind of a long post, so i thank you for taking the time to read and offer any opinions.\\n\\n**my grip type:**\\n\\ni play with what i can most closely equate to a combination of part fingertip grip and part palm grip, but i am not sure if this is a product of using the wrong mouse for a long time, or if it's just how i naturally use the mouse. i find myself using my thumb and ring/pinky fingers to hold and move the mouse by the sides, with my palm almost cradling the very back of the mouse. my fingers lay more flat across the mouse than a claw grip, so i'm kind of \"choked\" down on the mouse more towards the back, and because i have maybe smaller than average hands (i am female, so comparing to what i assume is the majority/target audience for gaming mice being the average male sized hand) but not completely flat like a palm grip. \\n\\n**what i play:**\\n\\ni play a variety of games from mmorpgs to mobas to fps, and use varying dpi settings across these games (ranging from 4500-9000). i prefer a hard style mat, as most mice seem to slide easier for me on this surface, and allow me quick movement without having to move my whole arm/wrist or even my palm on higher dpi settings.\\n\\n**what i like/dislike in a mouse:**\\n\\n* i generally prefer a bigger/fuller mouse to a smaller mouse. \\n* i also prefer a mouse that has a taller/more pronounced palm area, as it tends to feel better under my palm/heel of my hand, even though i barely touch that area of the mouse. \\n* i do like the mice that have the little kind of lip on the left side for the thumb, but i don't find myself missing it when i'm using a mouse that doesn't have it, either.\\n* i would prefer a few extra buttons in addition to the typical two on the left side of the mouse\\n* wireless/wired isn't really a factor in my choice. wireless might be nice, but usually adds a lot in price.\\n\\n**mice i have tried:**\\n\\ni'll start with the more recent and go backwards as far as i can remember:\\n\\n* razer basilisk - had positive reviews and seemed to have a few features i was looking for. i liked the dpi shift button (though i would use it for other binds or macros) and the thumb cradle thing, but it felt small and kind of cheap, and the left and right click buttons were noticeably a harder click than any mouse i can recall using.\\n\\n* logitech g502 hero - loved the extra buttons at first and adjustable scroll wheel, but the mouse felt too long and narrow. i thought i would like the extra buttons along the edge of the left click, but i found them to be too close, and more than once hit them accidentally\\n\\n* razer mamba elite - this is my current mouse, as i returned both of the other two. i like this mouse the most of the rest that i have tried, but i wish it had more buttons and maybe a fuller feeling grip. it just doesn't feel perfect.\\n\\n* corsair glaive - i liked this a lot too, at first. i liked being able to swap the thumb rest part on the left size, and the palm area felt full in my hand, but my ring and pinky finger felt uncomfortable on the side, and after about an hour of gaming my hand started to cramp. additionally, i found the icue software to be buggy and laggy\\n\\n* razer trinity naga - this is the mouse my husband currently uses. i love the idea of being able to swap the side buttons easily, and more importantly, i love the shape of the palm area - this is the only mouse that fills my palm for my grip style! but the pink rest on the right side drives me nuts. i didn't like that the 12 button attachment has no differing textures or anything on the buttons to help orient where your thumb is, and it makes it difficult to know what button you're pressing, defeating the purpose. the moba option is probably my favorite of the three, but i don't care for the buttons being in a circular layout.\\n\\n* razer lancehead te - i had this because i liked the pure white set up, but i hated this mouse. it was too small, the ambidextrous shape was almost painful to hold, and i couldn't game for more than an hour at a time without literal hand cramping. i did like the buttons on the side as well as the left.\\n\\n* steelseries sensei 310 - feels too small and did not like the ambidextrous symmetry\\n\\n* razer deathadder - this has long been a fan favorite, and i didn't hate it, but i didn't love it. it just didn't feel right in my hand, and i can't recall exactly what it was at this point.\\n\\n* razer naga hex (v1) - this was one of those old ones with the shiny grip, and i hated the glossy plastic feel.\\n\\nprior to that, i used a variety of logitech or whatever mice, not r...  \n",

       "      <td>my question is about my retirement fund investments, but first, a little background:\\n\\ni'm 56 years old.  i retired three years ago due to health issue.  my pension is $2,000/month, and as of now my former employer pays for 70% of my insurance, but this will be reduced over the next few years to 50%.\\n\\ni earn a net (after expenses and taxes) of $60,000+/year ($150,000 gross) from licensing fees for a script i wrote that is used on various websites, but this money could evaporate at any time (i've thought this for ten years, but it keeps increasing.  i'd rather not plan on this income, just in case.)\\n\\nthe two houses i own are worth around $350,000 total. one has a mortgage of $80k, the other has a mortgage of $85k.  worth noting:  one of the homes is occupied by a family member who is paying about 1/2 the mortgage.  i've been supporting her for a few years, and my guess is she won't be able to pay even 1/2 for much longer.  \\n\\ni have no other debt, but may need a new car in the next year or two.\\n\\nmy retirement accounts are as follows:\\n\\nbrokerage account: $40k in stocks and an s&amp;amp;p index fund.\\n\\nsep ira: 60k in stocks and an s&amp;amp;p index fund.\\n\\n403b:  $204k, all in cash earning 2%\\n\\ni have $55 in a savings account as an emergency fund.\\n\\nwith my gov pension i'm not too sure i'll get social security when eligible, even though i still pay a great deal into ss.  \\n\\nhere's my question:  \\n\\nbeing conservative, what percent should i have in cash, how much in stocks, and how much in the s&amp;amp;p index fund?  i'm inclined to keep things as is, and buy incrementally on a market correction, and a bear market (which i believe will happen before i hit 65), but i'm looking for advice from others.\\n</td>\n",

experience with fidelity's 401k plans.\\n\\n\\nbackground: i now have a job making ~60k, i've followed the how-to guides on here to set up a roth ira with vanguard with a mix that i feel comfortable with and made the max contribution for 2017, plan to do the same for 2018.\\n\\n\\nbut i'm also contributing to a fidelity roth 401k for my employer's match. i believe i'm contributing 7%, and my employer is contributing 3.5%.\\n\\n\\ni felt fairly good about my setup for everything until a few weeks ago. i got an email from fidelity about \"fidelity portfolio advisory service at work.\" at the time, i just thought it was some web-tool to help pair me with the right mutual fund. then i watched john oliver's retirement episode, started doing some digging, and now i'm not so sure.\\n\\n\\nthe fidelity at work plan i picked has a \"net advisory fee\" of about .5%. when i was looking into it, i thought this was the expense ratio, and now i'm realizing this is likely an additional fee for an additional service. \\n\\n\\ni've dug around their website, and they do a very good job of making this seem like just the default thing to do, but i'm wondering if anyone who has

i'm also going to ask family members to co-sign me if they're willing. i'm not a big spender and manage my financials wisely but unfortunately, i have nothing on paper to show that which is why i want to start building my credit now rather than later.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\ni'm on a min. wage employment and i don't pay any rent. i actually don't have much expenses aside from grocery, cell &amp; internet services. after paying all of those, i still have money left over which i put into my savings. so right now, i'm looking for advice from others who have experience with this so i can steer myself onto the right track. much is appreciated. kudos.  \n",

 i'm inclined to keep things as is, and buy incrementally on a market correction, and a bear market (which i believe will happen before i hit 65), but i'm looking for advice from others.\\n  \n",

\\nmy work allows for four months of paid maternity leave, and right now i plan on taking six months. so at a minimum i know i need two months of my paycheck saved, plus the hospital copays (we have great medical insurance). what else? i'm a little lost, so i'm looking for advice from other soon-to-be parents or couples with babies. thank you!  \n",

it's taken them roughly 2+ weeks to respond and it'll take another week or 2 for the repairs to be completed. should i claim the mortgage for that time, or at least interest on the mortgage?  \n",

even though buying a new place isn't the most ideal right now, or stick it out for another year or so and risk having to sink more money into it than i'd be saving up/gaining in equity and it possibly being extremely difficult to sell.  \n",
       "646667  hi folks!     \\n\\nlong time lurker (~7.5 years) using a throwaway.\\nhoping to get some good feedback from the gurus of /r/personalfinance since i'm pretty torn.   \\n   \\ni've been with company a for 2 years. i was approached by a recruiter last month to take on a similar position at a different company in a different industry. i have now been given an offer! ^^^(yay.)   \\n\\n\\n**tl;dr: i've been pretty happy at my current job, but felt that the money was lacking. i told the recruiter my target was $120k-$140k based on average salary studies. after a month of interviews, i've finally received an offer for $100k and i'm expected to make a decision by friday and begin working 2nd week of july.** \\n\\n----------------  \\n#**company a (current)**   \\nsalaried, full time.   \\nstart base salary: $80,000.   \\ncurrent base salary: $84,250   \\nbonus: 10% of base salary target, actual annual incentive payment range is 0-200% of target   \\nbenefits: medical/dental/vision   \\nretirement savings plan: 3% full match, and additional 3% match of 50% of contributions in traditional 401k (fully vests at 3 years, currently only 2 years vested so far)  \\nlocation: local office in my city, requires 10-25% travel, international and domestic, work remote 1-2 days a month, 15 min drive 1 way   \\nsize: local division is ~250 people    \\nvacation: 120 hours/15 days (3 weeks), 13 holidays   \\ncontinuing education (mba target start date fall 2020), requires 1 year of work post graduation   \\n \\n----------------  \\n#**company b offer**   \\nsalaried, full time.   \\nstart base salary: $100,000   \\nbonus: 10% of base salary target, actual annual incentive payment range is 0-200% of target   \\nbenefits: medical/dental/vision   \\nretirement savings plan: 4% match traditional 401k, employee discount stock buy program   \\nlocation: remote, requires 25% travel minimum us only   \\nsize: local division is ~30 people   \\nvacation: 80 hours/10 days (2 weeks), 11 holidays   \\ncontinuing education (mba target start date may begin 6 months after start date, but likely will be delayed beyond fall 2020 due to learning the new industry) requires 1 year of work post graduation   \\n\\n---------------- \\n##**company a details**   \\nmy current manager knows that i've been unhappy about my current salary since november 2018.\\ni've never been ranked as a top performer, only ranked as meets expectations. my manager has given me feedback on actions i can take to grow in my role, but largely just attributes it to \"time and experience in the role\". i've given it my best effort despite several setbacks at the office and at home, but i doubt i will be ranked as a top performer this year during our evaluations at end of 2019. there is a large skill gap between my boss and myself just due to years of experience in our industry, but he has always taken time to explain or give assistance when i need it. working hours have ranged from 40 to 80 hours in a week depending on the week, though it is often around 40 hours in the office and 5-10 outside the office.\\n\\nthere is little room for advancement as our team is small and unlikely to grow in headcount, though my manager has indicated that he intends for me to be promoted at some non-indicated point of time in the future, possibly to replace his position in about 3-5 years. it is difficult to assess if i want to take on the job, because it is often times very difficult and requires many hours working outside the typical 8-5, and they would likely not promote me to have the same amount of salary considering i have less years of experience and credentials. i love the work and environment, but i have felt it's mostly due to the way my manager has excellent people skills and technical expertise.\\n\\n i have a solid reputation with my coworkers, and my boss is a good mentor who actively stands up for me and backs my decision making. i actively learn new things on the job, receive training and travel to customer sites. the company has been flexible with me being a new parent, but i fear that i'm unable to \"keep up\" with other people because i have strict scheduling based around daycare availability. \\n\\n---------------- \\n##**company b details**   \\nas for company b, they are nice enough. i do feel i could potentially negotiate a better offer, though recruiter told me in private that they are at a hard limit of $130k for base+bonus. he advised my years of experience do not constitute a $120k salary base (4 years total professional work experience).\\n\\nthe position itself is remote, meaning i could work from home most days, and travel to customer sites, trade shows, etc. minimum 1-2 times a month. no relocation required. daycare would likely remain. i cannot work with a baby at home.\\n\\ncompany b product is much more basic compared to company a and not nearly as exciting, but it is a strong stable product with strong projected growth for the company. they have achieved rapid growth over the past several years, and have created t...  \n",

property taxes), and it's all happening faster than i expected after listing my house. two days with the house on the market and i'm in contract. i'm looking at condos, but there seems to be more pitfalls with condos than there are with houses because they're connected to your neighbors homes. i'm looking for advice from people that own or have owned condos on what to look for or try to avoid.

       "      <td>i am looking for advice from people to help me choose between two jobs.i am a graduate from aircraft maintenance program in canada, and i recently got hired as a ramp agent by both companies. my goal is to become a licensed engineer in the future, and as canadian regulation stands anyone who wants to become a licensed engineer has to work as apprentice to fill out their work log book to 75% completion. however, before getting the apprentice position most companies prefer to hire people with some ramp experience. think of the ramp job as pre-apprenticeship of an apprenticeship.here comes my problem.company a specialized in ramp work, and is offering a full time position (40hr per week) with $3/hr more than the other company. however, i would have to find an apprentice position elsewhere after i have enough ramp experience.company b is a small local airline, with potential to get an internal transfer into apprentice position after 1 or 2 years of work within company if such position is available. however, the catch is, the pay is $3/hr less with no benefit. the job is also an on-call part time only job, meaning i'll only be getting around 10 - 15 hours of work per week and my working time and working hour will always vary since it's an aviation job. (which means i may be working 12am to 5am today, and 3pm to 6pm next day.i would love to get some help from people with experience which company should i choose, and why. thank you very much!</td>\n",

       "      <td>21m living in melbourne, australia with my parents.looking for advice from first home buyers, those in shared houses and of course, those in the same predicament as mei'm in a state of complete contradiction to whether i should continue to live at home to save more, move into a shared house with 3 other friends or purchase my own house and live alone. of course, it is most effective for the long run if i were to continue living at home to save more money. i'd consider myself a workoholic as i work 3 jobs. 38 hours in a warehouse, 30 hours in a restaurant and 16 hours doing cash in hand work on the weekends. i'm happy with this, and i even have time to gym and continue my hobbies. living at home is great, there's nothing wrong with it but i want experience in this world, i want freedom and of course, responsibility. at this point, i'm willing to trade less savings for more freedom and experience.moving in with friends (renting) seems great, the party life would definitely be bliss, yet i'm rarely home. i love my mates, they're awesome and i'd be nowhere without them yet the idea of renting scares me, your money is being voided and not reinstated back into a house. i'm a finance guy, i love maths and business. with that in mind, i know a lot of people rent and that's not a problem and i know it's the least expensive option aside from living with my parents. renting with friends is an option of freedom, fun and least expense but at the trade of not owning my own house.purchasing a house is a scary, yet dream i want to become true. i work hard and i'd be able to keep the payments up. i have enough for a deposit but is it too expensive? is 21 too young to own a house by yourself? i'm scared and i don't know who i can turn to for advice in regards to the process of even buying a house, let alone daily problems for a first home owner. this path seems the most yet somehow the least optimal (if that makes sense) for me, yet very scary. as i mentioned earlier, i'm rarely home so would owning my own place even grant me infinite freedom?i'm scared but i want to experience more in this world, any advice would be extremely appreciated.</td>\n",

       "      <td>we have an insane amount of bills that need to be paid by the beginning of june and my father hasnt gone to work at his own company in over 2 months. he has laid on a couch and slept for that long. his excuses for doing so range from saying his arthritis in his hips hurt to he has the flu and cannot go to work (he has no symptoms of the flu whatsoever). since he is not going to work, he is not getting paid. he has no income aside from his social security, which is like 2k a month. but the irs is taking portions of that away from him because he owes like 90k to them. we are barely able to pay the mortgage. my mom only works 16 hours a week as a kitchen manager at an elementary school. i ask her if she could possibly get another job to help pay the bills and she just ignores me and says \"this job already feels like full time.\" she is using as much money as she can to pay my fathers bills, but its not enoughi work technically part time at a retail store called zara. i make around 12.50 an hour when i combine my wage+global commission. my hours can vary from 20 a week to like 35 a week. depending on what my manager gives me. i asked him what it would take to get my on full time. minimum 37 hours a week.... plus benefits(health and dental care). he said its up to me... i can do it if i wanted to.this is my issue, and basically what i need advice from you guys for.... clearly i cant depend on my parents. i shouldnt be anyways. i want to move out and be on my own, so that i can depend on myself, im sick of walking past my dad sleeping on the couch everyday, smelling like shit because he doesnt shower, and then passing by the stacks of bills in the kitchen on my way out to my dads car on my way to my 9 hour shift. i live in california, the south bay, so the cost of living here is pretty ficking high. i pull in about 600-700 bucks every 2 weeks right now. if i was full time..it'd be around 1000 every 2 weeks.give or take teh commision earned between the pay periods. i also want to go to school, i'm a business major, but i'm not the best student. i struggle at doing well in school. i'm not sure when i will be able to get my degree done when im workign 40 hours a week living on my own. plus im fucking terrified to live on my own. i have been diagnosed with ptsd from my awful childhood and i have crippling anxiety. sorry if this is so jumbled and put together so poorly. i typed this out after i had a really bad altercation with my dad. so my mind is all over the place.</td>\n",

(which means i may be working 12am to 5am today, and 3pm to 6pm next day.i would love to get some help from people with experience which company should i choose, and why. thank you very much!   \n",

       "125846  we have an insane amount of bills that need to be paid by the beginning of june and my father hasnt gone to work at his own company in over 2 months. he has laid on a couch and slept for that long. his excuses for doing so range from saying his arthritis in his hips hurt to he has the flu and cannot go to work (he has no symptoms of the flu whatsoever). since he is not going to work, he is not getting paid. he has no income aside from his social security, which is like 2k a month. but the irs is taking portions of that away from him because he owes like 90k to them. we are barely able to pay the mortgage. my mom only works 16 hours a week as a kitchen manager at an elementary school. i ask her if she could possibly get another job to help pay the bills and she just ignores me and says \"this job already feels like full time.\" she is using as much money as she can to pay my fathers bills, but its not enoughi work technically part time at a retail store called zara. i make around 12.50 an hour when i combine my wage+global commission. my hours can vary from 20 a week to like 35 a week. depending on what my manager gives me. i asked him what it would take to get my on full time. minimum 37 hours a week.... plus benefits(health and dental care). he said its up to me... i can do it if i wanted to.this is my issue, and basically what i need advice from you guys for.... clearly i cant depend on my parents. i shouldnt be anyways. i want to move out and be on my own, so that i can depend on myself, im sick of walking past my dad sleeping on the couch everyday, smelling like shit because he doesnt shower, and then passing by the stacks of bills in the kitchen on my way out to my dads car on my way to my 9 hour shift. i live in california, the south bay, so the cost of living here is pretty ficking high. i pull in about 600-700 bucks every 2 weeks right now. if i was full time..it'd be around 1000 every 2 weeks.give or take teh commision earned between the pay periods. i also want to go to school, i'm a business major, but i'm not the best student. i struggle at doing well in school. i'm not sure when i will be able to get my degree done when im workign 40 hours a week living on my own. plus im fucking terrified to live on my own. i have been diagnosed with ptsd from my awful childhood and i have crippling anxiety. sorry if this is so jumbled and put together so poorly. i typed this out after i had a really bad altercation with my dad. so my mind is all over the place.    \n",

(side note: that left me to pay the entire bill for brunch when we agreed beforehand we were all only paying for ourselves, so that was awesome /s.)a few days ago i got a text from sarah that said she talked to dan and both of them are disgusted by my behavior and have decided they can't interact with such a \"hateful, homophobic bitch\" anymore and both will be blocking my number and blocking me on all forms of social media.i still feel pretty justified in what i said but it's started eating at me, especially because it made two different people decide i'm horrible enough to cease contact with altogether. aita here?</td>\n",

       "52168  a couple years ago i made friends with a guy and a girl who we'll call sarah and dan. we grew to be fairly good friends. we're all adults in our mid 20s and when we get together we get really into talking about our relationships.it just so happens that dan is gay, and he liked to actively participate in giving out advice when sarah and i had relationship issues, and we could do the same for him. but after a while i noticed that he never actually gave me any advice when i had problems with my romantic relationships. when sarah wanted to talk about her problems he was helpful and gave sound advice, but whenever i was seeking the same, his advice began and ended with \"you should dump your boyfriend and switch to girls.\"i thought it was a joke the first time but he kept saying it every time i went looking for advice from my friends. he never gave that advice to sarah when she was having guy problems (even though she's bisexual and that advice would be more applicable to her, although i personally think it's a rude thing to say to anyone). i'm straight, and i have never implied otherwise. i've never even been bi-curious. for me, personally, the idea of myself being with a woman romantically makes me uncomfortable and i told that to dan several times and asked him to stop. he said he would try. he didn't stop.  i started skipping meeting up with dan and sarah because his comments continued to make me uncomfortable, but several days ago i decided to meet them for brunch and we started talking romantic relationships. i was supportive as he described a few problems with his current boyfriend and sarah and i offered a few suggestions to how he could solve those problems; overall it was a good chat.i'm finally in a committed relationship with a man i adore and i was very excited to share my excitement about it. along the way i mentioned just a couple pet peeves i had with my boyfriend (that aren't even a big issue) and dan said it again. \"well, time for you to dump him and switch to girls!\"i just snapped. i raised my voice (not quite a yell, but louder than usual) and asked, \"dan, why don't *you* switch to girls?\"he acted like i slapped him. started crying and demanding to know why i'd ever say something so horrible to him, then he grabbed his stuff and stormed out. sarah told me how disgusted she was by me and also stormed out. (side note: that left me to pay the entire bill for brunch when we agreed beforehand we were all only paying for ourselves, so that was awesome /s.)a few days ago i got a text from sarah that said she talked to dan and both of them are disgusted by my behavior and have decided they can't interact with such a \"hateful, homophobic bitch\" anymore and both will be blocking my number and blocking me on all forms of social media.i still feel pretty justified in what i said but it's started eating at me, especially because it made two different people decide i'm horrible enough to cease contact with altogether. aita here?   \n",

       "      <td>i've never purchased real estate before, so i'm out of my depth as well. but my parents bring me legal documents to read over because i can read english, and i'm trying my best to help them through this process. i've been telling them they need advice from a professional, but the house closes on monday and i'm afraid i'm the best they've got for now.anyway, the situation is that they bought a foreclosed house from auction.com, without financing on their part. currently, the house is owned by the bank, who foreclosed it from some property company. they've had hardly any contact with either of them, and they've been dealing with the auction site, who has been light on details.they've never seen the interior of the house. they don't know who lives there. but they do know that the house is currently being rented.they've never seen the lease. they're not clear on who currently receives rent, but they'd like to keep receiving rent after the house is closed. they seem to be under the impression that the original property company still holds the lease. they don't have any documents to this effect, and they say that they've been told they're not allowed to look at the lease until the property is closed.so i have some specific questions:1. once the house closes, does the lease automatically transfer to them? i know they are required to continue honoring the old lease, but i'm not clear on this. would they need to ask anything from the bank or the property company? and if they're bound by the existing lease, is there a way for them to review it beforehand?2. if both parties are ok with continuing the lease, what do my parents have to do?3. if the tenants want to move out, what happens?4. if my parents want to evict, what happens? texas law requires 30 day notice but federal law requires a 90 day notice for foreclosures, but i don't know what statute applies to my parents.5. if my parents want to annul the old lease and get the tenants to sign a new one, what should they do? is it in their best interests to pursue this? and generally, if you can tell me what they should look out for, what potential problems they might run into, and just any links to resources, i'd really appreciate that as well. thanks!</td>\n",

       "116677  i've never purchased real estate before, so i'm out of my depth as well. but my parents bring me legal documents to read over because i can read english, and i'm trying my best to help them through this process. i've been telling them they need advice from a professional, but the house closes on monday and i'm afraid i'm the best they've got for now.anyway, the situation is that they bought a foreclosed house from auction.com, without financing on their part. currently, the house is owned by the bank, who foreclosed it from some property company. they've had hardly any contact with either of them, and they've been dealing with the auction site, who has been light on details.they've never seen the interior of the house. they don't know who lives there. but they do know that the house is currently being rented.they've never seen the lease. they're not clear on who currently receives rent, but they'd like to keep receiving rent after the house is closed. they seem to be under the impression that the original property company still holds the lease. they don't have any documents to this effect, and they say that they've been told they're not allowed to look at the lease until the property is closed.so i have some specific questions:1. once the house closes, does the lease automatically transfer to them? i know they are required to continue honoring the old lease, but i'm not clear on this. would they need to ask anything from the bank or the property company? and if they're bound by the existing lease, is there a way for them to review it beforehand?2. if both parties are ok with continuing the lease, what do my parents have to do?3. if the tenants want to move out, what happens?4. if my parents want to evict, what happens? texas law requires 30 day notice but federal law requires a 90 day notice for foreclosures, but i don't know what statute applies to my parents.5. if my parents want to annul the old lease and get the tenants to sign a new one, what should they do? is it in their best interests to pursue this? and generally, if you can tell me what they should look out for, what potential problems they might run into, and just any links to resources, i'd really appreciate that as well. thanks!   \n",

       "      <td>looking for advice from the community. this is a throwaway account because my family knows my regular reddit name and i don't want them to worry about me.  i have a piece of property in maine with a mobile home on it.  my wife, kids and i had to move out unexpectedly 3.5 years ago.  we had to move because while dealing with a medical emergency the house froze up (this was february 2015). when the weather decided to turn back above freezing the pipes had burst and flooded the mobile home.  rendering the kitchen/bathrooms useless due to water log and destroying the sub floor. when we discovered the damage we were  in no position financially, emotionally (because of the ongoing medical emergency) or otherwise to deal with the home.  my mother had a rental home that was unoccupied at the time and allowed us to stay in that rent free for 2 years to allow us to get back on our feet.  in that time we paid off all debt we had except for the mortgage on the ruined mobile home, and my car.fast forward to today, and we have been paying rent for a year and a half.  we are a little behind on it but doing alright.  the mortgage on the ruined house is a couple months behind. my car is paid off and she had to get a new car that we bought used and are keeping up on payments.  my wife is unable to work due to the cost of childcare in our area and us having 4 children that need to go to 3 different school systems. i work for a quasi-government agency and bring home $520 a week (not including overtime).  that is after all health insurance and other benefits. my daughter (who had the medical emergency that tipped the scale for us 3.5 years ago) gets a ssi benefit of about 600/month.  i have a second job that is mostly winter related that i make about 12000 from but 80% of that is made from november to february. the other 2400ish is spread out throughout the rest of the year and can't be counted on at any given time for a budget.  we owe about 22000 on the mortgage. the payment is 350 a month. currently owe 700.  the property taxes are 800 a year and those are two years behind.  my wife's car has 2000 left on it at 200 a month.  rent is 600. cell phones are 150, internet is 65 electricity is 180. we paid credit cards and student loans off while living rent free. adding this all up my bill's equal 1545 a month.my income is 2680.  this leaves 1135 for groceries which are usually 750 a month for 4 kids my wife and i, gas to do school runs and get to work etc and anything else that comes up.  not much room for error. so where i am seeking advice: what to do about my ruined mobile home/property?  i can't sell it as is unless the person has cash, because it can't be mortgaged by someone else due to it not being livable. i can't demolish it and sell just the property because the bank holds the deed.  i can't fix it or replace it because i can't afford to.  my credit is shot.  and have no one to help cosign a loan to fix/replace it in order to sell or move back to that property.  i'm at a loss.  any suggestions will be highly appreciated. i'll answer any questions people have to help me find a solution to this anchor holding us down.</td>\n",

^^^(yay.)   **tl;dr: i've been pretty happy at my current job, but felt that the money was lacking. i told the recruiter my target was $120k-$140k based on average salary studies. after a month of interviews, i've finally received an offer for $100k and i'm expected to make a decision by friday and begin working 2nd week of july.** ----------------  #**company a (current)**   salaried, full time.   start base salary: $80,000.   current base salary: $84,250   bonus: 10% of base salary target, actual annual incentive payment range is 0-200% of target   benefits: medical/dental/vision   retirement savings plan: 3% full match, and additional 3% match of 50% of contributions in traditional 401k (fully vests at 3 years, currently only 2 years vested so far)  location: local office in my city, requires 10-25% travel, international and domestic, work remote 1-2 days a month, 15 min drive 1 way   size: local division is ~250 people    vacation: 120 hours/15 days (3 weeks), 13 holidays   continuing education (mba target start date fall 2020), requires 1 year of work post graduation    ----------------  #**company b offer**   salaried, full time.   start base salary: $100,000   bonus: 10% of base salary target, actual annual incentive payment range is 0-200% of target   benefits: medical/dental/vision   retirement savings plan: 4% match traditional 401k, employee discount stock buy program   location: remote, requires 25% travel minimum us only   size: local division is ~30 people   vacation: 80 hours/10 days (2 weeks), 11 holidays   continuing education (mba target start date may begin 6 months after start date, but likely will be delayed beyond fall 2020 due to learning the new industry) requires 1 year of work post graduation   ---------------- ##**company a details**   my current manager knows that i've been unhappy about my current salary since november 2018.i've never been ranked as a top performer, only ranked as meets expectations. my manager has given me feedback on actions i can take to grow in my role, but largely just attributes it to \"time and experience in the role\". i've given it my best effort despite several setbacks at the office and at home, but i doubt i will be ranked as a top performer this year during our evaluations at end of 2019. there is a large skill gap between my boss and myself just due to years of experience in our industry, but he has always taken time to explain or give assistance when i need it. working hours have ranged from 40 to 80 hours in a week depending on the week, though it is often around 40 hours in the office and 5-10 outside the office.there is little room for advancement as our team is small and unlikely to grow in headcount, though my manager has indicated that he intends for me to be promoted at some non-indicated point of time in the future, possibly to replace his position in about 3-5 years. it is difficult to assess if i want to take on the job, because it is often times very difficult and requires many hours working outside the typical 8-5, and they would likely not promote me to have the same amount of salary considering i have less years of experience and credentials. i love the work and environment, but i have felt it's mostly due to the way my manager has excellent people skills and technical expertise. i have a solid reputation with my coworkers, and my boss is a good mentor who actively stands up for me and backs my decision making. i actively learn new things on the job, receive training and travel to customer sites. the company has been flexible with me being a new parent, but i fear that i'm unable to \"keep up\" with other people because i have strict scheduling based around daycare availability. ---------------- ##**company b details**   as for company b, they are nice enough. i do feel i could potentially negotiate a better offer, though recruiter told me in private that they are at a hard limit of $130k for base+bonus. he advised my years of experience do not constitute a $120k salary base (4 years total professional work experience).the position itself is remote, meaning i could work from home most days, and travel to customer sites, trade shows, etc. minimum 1-2 times a month. no relocation required. daycare would likely remain. i cannot work with a baby at home.company b product is much more basic compared to company a and not nearly as exciting, but it is a strong stable product with strong projected growth for the company. they have achieved rapid growth over the past several years, and have created this new position in response to that growth.i've been told multiple times that there is plenty of ro...</td>\n",

       "      <td>hello i need advice from the community here. i'm writing from a mobile device, so i may struggle with the formatting. please bear with me.i feel like i'm drowning in debt and i don't know what to do about it anymore. this started about 4 years ago when i went through a divorce, while simultaneously getting a nursing degree and fighting depression on and off (which i still battle). during that time, and after, i made some very poor financial decisions that are starting to really put me in a bind. i'll try to list out my income and debts below (this may be where i struggle with formatting).income: about 2400 per month though my position as an rndebts *mortgage: 115,000. my monthly payment is $750*school loans: 45,000. my monthly payment is $450. i tried getting a masters twice, but wasn't able to complete the program either time due to my depression and some various life events. this added a tremendous amount to my school loans.*car loan: $7,000 and $2,400 from a previous vehicle i owned. i pay $440 total per month*credit card debt: $17,000. at one point i could no longer make this payment, and it was turned over to a collections agency. i have put off dealing with this and honestly have no idea what to do. i can't afford the payments to start paying this down, so i have been avoiding contacting the collections agency to resolve this.*my utilities, cell phone, car insurance, gas, groceries, and other misc bills come to about $800 per month.i have $10,000 in savings, but i can scared to touch that as i don't want to lose my emergency funds in case something happens. all of the above leaves me in a constant state of anxiety and i'm getting to the point that i cannot take it anymore. i have considered filling for bankruptcy, but i don't want to ruin my credit any more than i already have. i'm open to all advice at this point.</td>\n",

       "      <td>hi! i’m looking for some advice, my “stats” are below:-husband, wife, two young kids-30k student loans-able to save 2k extra per month (not including    work bonuses and tax returns-400k house 360k still owed-we both max (and always have) our 401k contributions-roughly 30k in savings my wife and i are in our early 30s and i’m really just looking for advice. i know we are better off than most people and i want to make sure and set us up so we can retire early/work part time in our later years.a few of our friends started getting into real estate and i have browsed that subreddit a lot lately trying to learn everything o can. if i go down that route i would likely get my real estate license in my spare time.our monthly expenses aren’t too crazy, we have really been trying to save money. we lease both of our cars- i know that’s awful but we kept buying cars and trading them in two year s later. it’s a personality flaw we have and the cars we lease aren’t anything crazy (base package nissans). mortgage and daycare for two kids chews up about 6k per month unfortunately. im really just looking for advice from those similar to me maybe, what should i be doing? we both have good life insurance. we just don’t know if we should make a push to pay off our house, to invest in other properties, pay off student loans, or just save in a high yield account. thanks!!</td>\n",

 i can't sell it as is unless the person has cash, because it can't be mortgaged by someone else due to it not being livable. i can't demolish it and sell just the property because the bank holds the deed.  i can't fix it or replace it because i can't afford to.  my credit is shot.  and have no one to help cosign a loan to fix/replace it in order to sell or move back to that property.  i'm at a loss.  any suggestions will be highly appreciated. i'll answer any questions people have to help me find a solution to this anchor holding us down.    \n",

now) is bringing him to the brink. he’ll be out of money by may with another two months on his lease and a lot of belongings to move. i can’t move him in with me and despite me making a good salary for myself, i’m not sure i can cover his living expenses (even minimalist living expenses) on my own.my aunt has already floated him money to stay afloat while job searching and last week it really looked like he was about to pull a job down. it just fell through today though and now i’m not sure what is going to happen.i’m worried about him not just financially but mentally and emotionally. he lives alone without even any pets. i’m afraid what this could do to him and i don’t want to feel like i let something bad happen when i could have helped.i’m looking for advice from people who have been in this kind of situation.thanks.   \n",

^^^(yay.)   **tl;dr: i've been pretty happy at my current job, but felt that the money was lacking. i told the recruiter my target was $120k-$140k based on average salary studies. after a month of interviews, i've finally received an offer for $100k and i'm expected to make a decision by friday and begin working 2nd week of july.** ----------------  #**company a (current)**   salaried, full time.   start base salary: $80,000.   current base salary: $84,250   bonus: 10% of base salary target, actual annual incentive payment range is 0-200% of target   benefits: medical/dental/vision   retirement savings plan: 3% full match, and additional 3% match of 50% of contributions in traditional 401k (fully vests at 3 years, currently only 2 years vested so far)  location: local office in my city, requires 10-25% travel, international and domestic, work remote 1-2 days a month, 15 min drive 1 way   size: local division is ~250 people    vacation: 120 hours/15 days (3 weeks), 13 holidays   continuing education (mba target start date fall 2020), requires 1 year of work post graduation    ----------------  #**company b offer**   salaried, full time.   start base salary: $100,000   bonus: 10% of base salary target, actual annual incentive payment range is 0-200% of target   benefits: medical/dental/vision   retirement savings plan: 4% match traditional 401k, employee discount stock buy program   location: remote, requires 25% travel minimum us only   size: local division is ~30 people   vacation: 80 hours/10 days (2 weeks), 11 holidays   continuing education (mba target start date may begin 6 months after start date, but likely will be delayed beyond fall 2020 due to learning the new industry) requires 1 year of work post graduation   ---------------- ##**company a details**   my current manager knows that i've been unhappy about my current salary since november 2018.i've never been ranked as a top performer, only ranked as meets expectations. my manager has given me feedback on actions i can take to grow in my role, but largely just attributes it to \"time and experience in the role\". i've given it my best effort despite several setbacks at the office and at home, but i doubt i will be ranked as a top performer this year during our evaluations at end of 2019. there is a large skill gap between my boss and myself just due to years of experience in our industry, but he has always taken time to explain or give assistance when i need it. working hours have ranged from 40 to 80 hours in a week depending on the week, though it is often around 40 hours in the office and 5-10 outside the office.there is little room for advancement as our team is small and unlikely to grow in headcount, though my manager has indicated that he intends for me to be promoted at some non-indicated point of time in the future, possibly to replace his position in about 3-5 years. it is difficult to assess if i want to take on the job, because it is often times very difficult and requires many hours working outside the typical 8-5, and they would likely not promote me to have the same amount of salary considering i have less years of experience and credentials. i love the work and environment, but i have felt it's mostly due to the way my manager has excellent people skills and technical expertise. i have a solid reputation with my coworkers, and my boss is a good mentor who actively stands up for me and backs my decision making. i actively learn new things on the job, receive training and travel to customer sites. the company has been flexible with me being a new parent, but i fear that i'm unable to \"keep up\" with other people because i have strict scheduling based around daycare availability. ---------------- ##**company b details**   as for company b, they are nice enough. i do feel i could potentially negotiate a better offer, though recruiter told me in private that they are at a hard limit of $130k for base+bonus. he advised my years of experience do not constitute a $120k salary base (4 years total professional work experience).the position itself is remote, meaning i could work from home most days, and travel to customer sites, trade shows, etc. minimum 1-2 times a month. no relocation required. daycare would likely remain. i cannot work with a baby at home.company b product is much more basic compared to company a and not nearly as exciting, but it is a strong stable product with strong projected growth for the company. they have achieved rapid growth over the past several years, and have created this new position in response to that growth.i've been told multiple times that there is plenty of ro...   \n",

writing from a mobile device, so i may struggle with the formatting. please bear with me.i feel like i'm drowning in debt and i don't know what to do about it anymore. this started about 4 years ago when i went through a divorce, while simultaneously getting a nursing degree and fighting depression on and off (which i still battle). during that time, and after, i made some very poor financial decisions that are starting to really put me in a bind. i'll try to list out my income and debts below (this may be where i struggle with formatting).income: about 2400 per month though my position as an rndebts *mortgage: 115,000. my monthly payment is $750*school loans: 45,000. my monthly payment is $450. i tried getting a masters twice, but wasn't able to complete the program either time due to my depression and some various life events. this added a tremendous amount to my school loans.*car loan: $7,000 and $2,400 from a previous vehicle i owned. i pay $440 total per month*credit card debt: $17,000. at one point i could no longer make this payment, and it was turned over to a collections agency. i have put off dealing with this and honestly have no idea what to do. i can't afford the payments to start paying this down, so i have been avoiding contacting the collections agency to resolve this.*my utilities, cell phone, car insurance, gas, groceries, and other misc bills come to about $800 per month.i have $10,000 in savings, but i can scared to touch that as i don't want to lose my emergency funds in case something happens. all of the above leaves me in a constant state of anxiety and i'm getting to the point that i cannot take it anymore. i have considered filling for bankruptcy, but i don't want to ruin my credit any more than i already have. i'm open to all advice at this point.   \n",

we both have good life insurance. we just don’t know if we should make a push to pay off our house, to invest in other properties, pay off student loans, or just save in a high yield account. thanks!!   \n",
