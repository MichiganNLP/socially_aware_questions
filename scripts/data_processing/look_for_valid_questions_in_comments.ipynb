Her costume was “The Great Dust Bowl” - she wore a tattered dress and covered herself in dirt and carried around a bowl filled with dust. I was “The Great Depression” and wore my old pill bottles around my neck with my pajamas on and a comfy blanket over my shoulders. Everyone at the party thought it was great, especially since they were mostly friends of ours who know my history struggling with anxiety and depression and how amazing my beautiful fiancé has been through it all. We looked at my costume as a funny way to celebrate how much better i am doing (no longer on a ton of medication, am happy and healthier than ever). But when she posted a photo of us on her instagram she got some flak for “making a joke out of depression.” I believe that comedy = tragedy + time, but was wondering what you all think. Am i the asshole? \\n\\nedit: WIBTA if i send the instagram haters a  link to this post, haha   \n",

After buying and selling a lot ive become pretty trusting in the buyer/seller as I’ve never had any issues until now.\\n\\nI went about buying some Apple AirPods for $160 of this seller. I transferred the money to his bank account provided and sent through a screenshot of the receipt as usual. \\nUsually at this point the seller will post the item to me as that’s enough proof of transfer, but some don’t and want to see the money in their account before they post their item which is also fine. \\nAlthough, this guys claims he still hasn’t received my bank transfer 8 days later which is false.\\nI’ve tripled checked the bsb and account number I sent to and asked him to do the same that he provided me the right details. I’ve spoken to my bank and confirmed that the money has left my account and should be in his but he’s still denying he’s received anything.\\n\\nI’m wondering how I go about replying and attempting to recover my funds now. \\nDo I contact my police station? Do I call my banks fraud department?\\nI definitely won’t be as trusting on Facebook marketplace anymore.\\n\\nEDIT: I live in Australia   \n",

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\\n\\n*“But aren’t noncitizens not subject to the jurisdiction, and therefore this doesn’t apply to them?”*\\n\\nAlso no. The only people in America who aren’t subject to US jurisdiction are properly credentialed foreign diplomats. (edit: And in theory parents who were members of an occupying army who had their children in the US during the occupation).\\n\\n*“Can Trump amend the constitution to take this away?”*\\n\\nHe can try. But it requires 2/3 of both the House and Senate to vote in favor and then 3/4 of the states to ratify amendment. The moderators of legal advice, while not legislative experts, do not believe this is likely.\\n\\n*“So why did this come up now?”*\\n\\nProbably because there’s an election in a week. \\n\\nEDIT: *No serious academics or constitutional scholars take this position, however [there is debate](https://reason.com/volokh/2018/07/19/a-bad-argument-on-birthright-citizenship) on the far right wing of American politics that there is an alternative view to this argument. \\n\\nThe definitive case on this issue is [US v. Wong Kim Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark). Decided in 1898 it has been the law of the land for 120 years, barring a significant (and unexpected) narrowing of the ruling by the Supreme Court this is unlikely to change.    \n",

We flirt for a few weeks, bring each other snacks, talk alot. The usual. Valentine's day rolls around I ask her if she want to skip class and go for a drive. We do, get lost, and have a fantastic evening. We begin dating but only really meet during or after class. Due to her family having a chokehold on her. Theres alot I can't say but they tried to marry her to a 40y/o guy in Mexico when she was 6. And she always seemed like she was justifying everything her family did. Anyway this goes on for several months. \\n\\nMy parents go out of town and we decided to spend the night together. At arround 4 am we wake up to her phone ringing. It is her mother and she is screaming so loudly that i can hear it on the other side of the room. She wants her back home now. We comply and i drive her back home. Arriving at her home there is a police car outside and i brace for the worst. I am left in my car for 2 hours while they talk to her and her family. At they end of it they say I'm under arrest for sexual assault against her daughter. At this point I'm pretty confused and the officer says he can't tell me any more as it is an active investigation. They drive me to the sheriffs department and impound my car. I'm handcuffed to a wall in an interrogation room and left there for nearly 6 hours. During this time i am told they are speaking to my girlfriend in private away from her family. At the end of the 6 hours a detective comes in and un handcuffed me from the wall. I tell him everything that happened. He leaves and I am left alone for another few hours. The detective comes back and escorts me to my car gives me my keys and tells me  my gf liked me very much and didn't want to get me in trouble. And she has gone back home. They tell me I'm free to go but they may be in contact. \\n\\nAt this point I'm more confused than anything. And am kinda upset about being chained to a wall for most of this time. And am feeling multiple conflicting emotions. Was there something wrong done here or am I just crazy?\\n\\nI've been in contact with her a few times since, but she is saying her family forbids her from seeing me. I just feel lost right now. \\n \\nThere is alot more to this story, but I'm on mobile rn so I can edit when I get back home.\\n\\nEdit: Detroit MI   \n",

This new student says he has a mental condition( idk didn't really pay attention to that kind of stuff), but it really doesn't matter to me. So, all was going well for a couple of weeks until I started seeing him doing other devilish stuff around other people like snitching on people(claims its on accident), taking people stuff saying he didn't know, and just at random screaming like a banshee  at people for smacking or even just tapping their feet. People have been telling me he has a condition so they take up it up the ass and I don't really agree with that so i ry to stay clear of that person when possible.\\n\\n   So all was going well until I'm in the library about to go too class About to pick up my bag until I realise the new guy place his stuff around mines he was about to go as well so I just grab my bag and just trying to get out there. Then this the new guy grabbed my bag saying that is hes bad( granted our bag look the same but there is clear difference my bag has a medium size tear and hes doesnt). So Im telling him \"Look dude this has a huge tear I know yours doesn't now let go of my stuff.\", he told me to open it up I refused  then he started screaming trying to take my bad with him. So at this point I had enough of this bs and decided to punch him making him land right on his back. He started screaming and crying like like a little demon until teacher broke us up,   settled the situation and made us both open the bags too see if who was right(I was right).  Then the teacher asked who punch first the lil demon said I punched first it was true, but I did it becuase he was trying to steal my stuff. Short story after the teachers said  he has a mental condition and I should be more patience and more empathic. In my head I said fuck that this demon need  deserve what's coming to him. Now some people saying Im a jerk for doing that am I  jerk for standing up.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: I have been listening to others opinions and thoughts. I have come with my educated opinion that Iwas wrong and will try to day sorry and ask for forgiveness    \n",
       "85   My company has a 401k match. I noticed a few weeks ago that the match had not been applied the entire year (shame on me for not checking sooner). I asked the benefits team and I got an odd response. they say that because I started in 2017, the 2018 401k policy does not apply to me and that I must follow the 2017 401k standards and wait one year before getting the company match . The 2018 401k policy states that all employees get a company match immediately and that if you were hired prior to 2018 it is fully vested, otherwise it will take two years to vest. The issue that I have is that I was not eligible to start my 401k until 1/1/2018 AND the 2018 policy does not have any stipulation on eligibility other than you must be 21 and a full time employee, which I am.

She passed it but was still detained and taken to jail. She has yet to go before the judge, but she's been locked up for around 120 days because they keep moving her court date everytime it comes close. I don't have that much information because this is all I can get from phone calls she's occasionally allowed to have. I can try to press for more info but I doubt I'll get anything. She's taken multiple drug tests and has passed every single one. How long can they keep her like this?\\n\\nNotes:\\nMom DOES smoke and has smoked, even before I was born.\\n\\nI don't know who \"suspicious person\" is and neither does she.\\n\\nMom had a previous history of drugs (hell, I was an accidental child because of them) but she's been clean for a year and has visited rehab often.\\n\\nEDIT: She was on probation at one point, but isn't anymore, if that helps. She was arrested once for violation of probation.   \n",

I was dropping spik and no one cared because I was discussing it in a debating context. They did not care of when I said spik. But when I said \"nigga\" they reacted heavily. They continued on saying that I can not use that language, I was confused because i dropped spik just seconds earlier(their were black people there) After class they said that I offended some people and I should not use that language. I wanted to go call them out on the double standard but in order to stay in good standing I just apologized and moved on. AITA  \\n\\n\\nEdit: if people want to know I’m Latino :/    \n",
       "374  I'm not unrealistic about my looks, I know I'm not a supermodel.  However I am in very good shape and I have a pretty face.  I used to be much more rigorous about working out, which has gone way down since I started my career. But I still stay in great shape and am slim.  BF is an extremely athletic guy, but I don't think he's more physically attractive than I am, just more fit.\\n\\nWe were drinking about a month ago, and I jokingly got him to rate me. I wasn't expecting him to say 8/10, but it kind of shocked me, as all my previous boyfriends have spoken to me as though I was the most beautiful woman and called me 10/10. It made me feel unique and wanted and it just felt good to hear that. In comparison, it hurt to learn that my current bf doesn't feel that way.\\n\\nI stewed on it for a month, then last night I decided not to bottle up my feelings anymore and told him how I felt when I first heard it. He again confirmed that he thinks I am 8/10 in the looks category, but that I \"make up for it by being 12/10 everywhere else.\"  I really didn't know what to make of that. I have just opened up to him explaining it hurts me and he just confirms what he said? I didn't know how to talk to him about it, so I kind of clammed up and was distant for the rest of the evening. He kept trying to talk to me, and I just kept telling him it made me feel bad, but he never took it back.\\n\\nI just want him to tell me I am 10/10 in his eyes, even if it's not true. AITA?\\n\\nTl:dr:  BF told me I am 8/10 after some prompting from me, it hurt my feelings, I stewed on it and brought it up again to tell him how I feel, he confirmed I am 8/10 to him and now I am hurt and distant but honest with him about why I'm being this way.\\n\\nEdit: I hope he doesn't see this. It will be awkward. Taking the chance anyway, Reddit, judge away.\\n\\nEdit 2: Starting to look like I am the asshole. Open to suggestions on how to fix this or not be an asshole. The relationship is important to me but have I damaged it permanently?\\n\\nEdit 3: Final update, I told him the truth and apologized as per your suggestions. I said I love him and I know I'm being stupid about a small thing but that was how I feel. He used the words \"You are 10/10 in my eyes\" so I guess I finally got what I wanted, but I don't feel good about it because of how I treated him. So I apologized again, for making a big deal out of it and bringing it up in the first place and being cold about it last night. Thank you all for giving your...   \n",

I thought that it was a good thing to do and (of course), needed money at the time. I’m still glad that I did it, but they contacted me through Facebook, and forced pictures on me. It has been traumatic for my partner and I, and I want to do something about it. Any ideas? \\n\\nEdit: this was at a well-known “international sperm and egg bank” in NYC.

Her costume was “The Great Dust Bowl” - she wore a tattered dress and covered herself in dirt and carried around a bowl filled with dust. I was “The Great Depression” and wore my old pill bottles around my neck with my pajamas on and a comfy blanket over my shoulders. Everyone at the party thought it was great, especially since they were mostly friends of ours who know my history struggling with anxiety and depression and how amazing my beautiful fiancé has been through it all. We looked at my costume as a funny way to celebrate how much better i am doing (no longer on a ton of medication, am happy and healthier than ever). But when she posted a photo of us on her instagram she got some flak for “making a joke out of depression.” I believe that comedy = tragedy + time, but was wondering what you all think. Am i the asshole? \\n  \n",

After buying and selling a lot ive become pretty trusting in the buyer/seller as I’ve never had any issues until now.\\n\\nI went about buying some Apple AirPods for $160 of this seller. I transferred the money to his bank account provided and sent through a screenshot of the receipt as usual. \\nUsually at this point the seller will post the item to me as that’s enough proof of transfer, but some don’t and want to see the money in their account before they post their item which is also fine. \\nAlthough, this guys claims he still hasn’t received my bank transfer 8 days later which is false.\\nI’ve tripled checked the bsb and account number I sent to and asked him to do the same that he provided me the right details. I’ve spoken to my bank and confirmed that the money has left my account and should be in his but he’s still denying he’s received anything.\\n\\nI’m wondering how I go about replying and attempting to recover my funds now. \\nDo I contact my police station? Do I call my banks fraud department?\\nI definitely won’t be as trusting on Facebook marketplace anymore.\\n  \n",

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\\n\\n*“But aren’t noncitizens not subject to the jurisdiction, and therefore this doesn’t apply to them?”*\\n\\nAlso no. The only people in America who aren’t subject to US jurisdiction are properly credentialed foreign diplomats. (edit: And in theory parents who were members of an occupying army who had their children in the US during the occupation).\\n\\n*“Can Trump amend the constitution to take this away?”*\\n\\nHe can try. But it requires 2/3 of both the House and Senate to vote in favor and then 3/4 of the states to ratify amendment. The moderators of legal advice, while not legislative experts, do not believe this is likely.\\n\\n*“So why did this come up now?”*\\n\\nProbably because there’s an election in a week. \\n\\n\\nThe definitive case on this issue is [US v. Wong Kim Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark). Decided in 1898 it has been the law of the land for 120 years, barring a significant (and unexpected) narrowing of the ruling by the Supreme Court this is unlikely to change.   \n",

We flirt for a few weeks, bring each other snacks, talk alot. The usual. Valentine's day rolls around I ask her if she want to skip class and go for a drive. We do, get lost, and have a fantastic evening. We begin dating but only really meet during or after class. Due to her family having a chokehold on her. Theres alot I can't say but they tried to marry her to a 40y/o guy in Mexico when she was 6. And she always seemed like she was justifying everything her family did. Anyway this goes on for several months. \\n\\nMy parents go out of town and we decided to spend the night together. At arround 4 am we wake up to her phone ringing. It is her mother and she is screaming so loudly that i can hear it on the other side of the room. She wants her back home now. We comply and i drive her back home. Arriving at her home there is a police car outside and i brace for the worst. I am left in my car for 2 hours while they talk to her and her family. At they end of it they say I'm under arrest for sexual assault against her daughter. At this point I'm pretty confused and the officer says he can't tell me any more as it is an active investigation. They drive me to the sheriffs department and impound my car. I'm handcuffed to a wall in an interrogation room and left there for nearly 6 hours. During this time i am told they are speaking to my girlfriend in private away from her family. At the end of the 6 hours a detective comes in and un handcuffed me from the wall. I tell him everything that happened. He leaves and I am left alone for another few hours. The detective comes back and escorts me to my car gives me my keys and tells me  my gf liked me very much and didn't want to get me in trouble. And she has gone back home. They tell me I'm free to go but they may be in contact. \\n\\nAt this point I'm more confused than anything. And am kinda upset about being chained to a wall for most of this time. And am feeling multiple conflicting emotions. Was there something wrong done here or am I just crazy?\\n\\nI've been in contact with her a few times since, but she is saying her family forbids her from seeing me. I just feel lost right now. \\n \\nThere is alot more to this story, but I'm on mobile rn so I can edit when I get back home.\\n  \n",

This new student says he has a mental condition( idk didn't really pay attention to that kind of stuff), but it really doesn't matter to me. So, all was going well for a couple of weeks until I started seeing him doing other devilish stuff around other people like snitching on people(claims its on accident), taking people stuff saying he didn't know, and just at random screaming like a banshee  at people for smacking or even just tapping their feet. People have been telling me he has a condition so they take up it up the ass and I don't really agree with that so i ry to stay clear of that person when possible.\\n\\n   So all was going well until I'm in the library about to go too class About to pick up my bag until I realise the new guy place his stuff around mines he was about to go as well so I just grab my bag and just trying to get out there. Then this the new guy grabbed my bag saying that is hes bad( granted our bag look the same but there is clear difference my bag has a medium size tear and hes doesnt). So Im telling him \"Look dude this has a huge tear I know yours doesn't now let go of my stuff.\", he told me to open it up I refused  then he started screaming trying to take my bad with him. So at this point I had enough of this bs and decided to punch him making him land right on his back. He started screaming and crying like like a little demon until teacher broke us up,   settled the situation and made us both open the bags too see if who was right(I was right).  Then the teacher asked who punch first the lil demon said I punched first it was true, but I did it becuase he was trying to steal my stuff. Short story after the teachers said  he has a mental condition and I should be more patience and more empathic. In my head I said fuck that this demon need  deserve what's coming to him. Now some people saying Im a jerk for doing that am I  jerk for standing up.\\n\\n\\n  \n",
       "85   My company has a 401k match. I noticed a few weeks ago that the match had not been applied the entire year (shame on me for not checking sooner). I asked the benefits team and I got an odd response. they say that because I started in 2017, the 2018 401k policy does not apply to me and that I must follow the 2017 401k standards and wait one year before getting the company match . The 2018 401k policy states that all employees get a company match immediately and that if you were hired prior to 2018 it is fully vested, otherwise it will take two years to vest. The issue that I have is that I was not eligible to start my 401k until 1/1/2018 AND the 2018 policy does not have any stipulation on eligibility other than you must be 21 and a full time employee, which I am.

She passed it but was still detained and taken to jail. She has yet to go before the judge, but she's been locked up for around 120 days because they keep moving her court date everytime it comes close. I don't have that much information because this is all I can get from phone calls she's occasionally allowed to have. I can try to press for more info but I doubt I'll get anything. She's taken multiple drug tests and has passed every single one. How long can they keep her like this?\\n\\nNotes:\\nMom DOES smoke and has smoked, even before I was born.\\n\\nI don't know who \"suspicious person\" is and neither does she.\\n\\nMom had a previous history of drugs (hell, I was an accidental child because of them) but she's been clean for a year and has visited rehab often.\\n  \n",

I was dropping spik and no one cared because I was discussing it in a debating context. They did not care of when I said spik. But when I said \"nigga\" they reacted heavily. They continued on saying that I can not use that language, I was confused because i dropped spik just seconds earlier(their were black people there) After class they said that I offended some people and I should not use that language. I wanted to go call them out on the double standard but in order to stay in good standing I just apologized and moved on. AITA  \\n\\n  \n",

However I am in very good shape and I have a pretty face.  I used to be much more rigorous about working out, which has gone way down since I started my career. But I still stay in great shape and am slim.  BF is an extremely athletic guy, but I don't think he's more physically attractive than I am, just more fit.\\n\\nWe were drinking about a month ago, and I jokingly got him to rate me. I wasn't expecting him to say 8/10, but it kind of shocked me, as all my previous boyfriends have spoken to me as though I was the most beautiful woman and called me 10/10. It made me feel unique and wanted and it just felt good to hear that. In comparison, it hurt to learn that my current bf doesn't feel that way.\\n\\nI stewed on it for a month, then last night I decided not to bottle up my feelings anymore and told him how I felt when I first heard it. He again confirmed that he thinks I am 8/10 in the looks category, but that I \"make up for it by being 12/10 everywhere else.\"  I really didn't know what to make of that. I have just opened up to him explaining it hurts me and he just confirms what he said? I didn't know how to talk to him about it, so I kind of clammed up and was distant for the rest of the evening. He kept trying to talk to me, and I just kept telling him it made me feel bad, but he never took it back.\\n\\nI just want him to tell me I am 10/10 in his eyes, even if it's not true. AITA?\\n\\nTl:dr:  BF told me I am 8/10 after some prompting from me, it hurt my feelings, I stewed on it and brought it up again to tell him how I feel, he confirmed I am 8/10 to him and now I am hurt and distant but honest with him about why I'm being this way.\\n\\n\\nEdit 2: Starting to look like I am the asshole. Open to suggestions on how to fix this or not be an asshole. The relationship is important to me but have I damaged it permanently?\\n\\nEdit 3: Final update, I told him the truth and apologized as per your suggestions. I said I love him and I know I'm being stupid about a small thing but that was how I feel. He used the words \"You are 10/10 in my eyes\" so I guess I finally got what I wanted, but I don't feel good about it because of how I treated him. So I apologized again, for making a big deal out of it and bringing it up in the first place and being cold about it last night. Thank you all for giving your perspective.  \n",

I thought that it was a good thing to do and (of course), needed money at the time. I’m still glad that I did it, but they contacted me through Facebook, and forced pictures on me. It has been traumatic for my partner and I, and I want to do something about it. Any ideas? \\n  "
