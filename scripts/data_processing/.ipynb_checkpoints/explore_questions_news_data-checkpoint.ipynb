Qualifying and pole positions are nothing more than going through the motions.  Watching 8-10 cars speeding in a pack around tracks is boring.  Every caution brings them all back to start all over again - there is no reward for outdistancing the other cars by either engineering or driving skill.

And when the University spends millions to help athletes academically, Mr. Powell makes it sound like a bad thing.  Tutors??  How could they be so evil.  But I think the biggest violation of journalistic integrity is the timing of the article and Mr. Powell's insinuation that this team is a result.  This is obvious given the comments to the article which are outraged at the way UNC IS behaving.

Is it because people with smaller brain are more likely to drink sugary drink or for any other reason? The study design can not help to find a reason.

Once they know you do, they'll move on to something else.  Good face-to-face communication with your kids is best, but more and more difficult when everyone is looking at screens and not at each other. It used to be - back when dinosaurs roamed the earth - that parents had a sense of what was going on with their children because the house phone rang. Some of my best conversations with my children when they were teenagers were in the car, a captive audience who didn't need to make eye contact.  Now kids are having multiple conversations silently on their devices. I know of too many tragedies that families have faced that might have been avoided if parents knew their children were receiving harassing phone calls from exes, were talking about how hopeless they felt, were being bullied and controlled romantic partners and friends.  Snooping is OK, and let your children know that you may snoop. Talk to them about things that concern you. Learn how to moderate your snooping so that you aren't microscopically reading everything, but only checking in. They may not like it, but it isn't your job as a parent to be liked.\n",

      "text=In the late 80s, when I was in my teens, a famous columnist by the name of Bob Greene, invited me to his office, after hours. From there, he served me alcohol and basically took me on dates that were largely chaste and until he took me to a hotel room and tried to get me into bed. About 15 years later, another teenaged girl turned him in and he was fired. It turned out that despite being married with children, Greene had a pattern of wooing and seducing teenaged and women in their early 20s by suggesting he could get them journalism work. The point to this story is that where there is smoke, there is fire. Lots of young women were used and abused by this pattern and even though everyone at the newspapers where he worked knew about his behavior, nothing ever happened until someone decided to go public. Yes, that teenaged girl went after his money. But he lost his career instead, and also the respect of his family and the public. To those saying that O'Reilly didn't necessarily \"do\" anything- he obviously did. Why else would he go quietly? Why else would he pay out millions of dollars in hush money? America needs to wake up and stop giving the benefit of the doubt to rich, powerful men. \n",

In that sense, they're a lot like the Hawks from two years ago which won 60 regular-season games. These Celtics face the same challenge as those Hawks: can they beat the Cavaliers in the post-season? Those Hawks couldn't: LeBron and co. squashed them 4-0 in the conference finals. The Cavaliers do look weaker this year and have been downright bad for much of the last three months. But don't discount LeBron's ability to raise not only his own game, but that of his teammates, come playoff time. That ability is what the Celtics will have to develop (whether by their current core gaining more experience or by adding new talent) in order to be a true title contender.  2. As for the Knicks, Filip Bondy, in his column a few weeks ago about their struggles, said it all in the last sentence:  <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/sports/basketball/knicks-worst-seasons.html\" title=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/sports/basketball/knicks-worst-seasons.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/sports/basketball/knicks-worst-season...   \"And still, despite all evidence and reason, the Garden sells out.\" In other words, the problem, Knicks fans, is you, who keep spending money on tickets and concessions and showing up to games no matter how bad the team is.

That sense of watching something beautiful aside from the competitive thrust of the sport, with the built-in anticipation that one day fans would see the team of aspiring stars playing for the crown made coming to the park exciting--and it made losing tolerable. There was a sense of promise in the air.   But the Knick approach softens nothing. The game losses just point at the lowbrow loser mentality of the franchise, its failure of vision; as does the season-long quibbling about the damn triangle offense, Lord, what a downer!

It is a sad fact that the United States has gone from a manufacturing society to one based on services.   And one of the most lucrative services is gambling.  Should not the NFL be part of this society with a franchise in Las Vegas?   Will there be a greater temptation to fix games with the Raiders in Las Vegas, or lesser since bets on the home team will be more closely monitored?  To me, it just doesn't sound right - Las Vegas Raiders.   Let me tell you, during law school I knew a bookmaker who would literally make a valise of money after an NFL weekend.   The Raiders only play 10 dates a year, counting the exhibitions.   Are they going to have lines on those games?  If not, revenue at the sports books will suffer because the bookmaker makes money from the juice on every game -  no matter who wins.  NFL football is still king, and the Raiders will have more revenue with this new stadium - as well as support from casinos who will buy tickets.  I'd have to think the Raiders will hurt the Vegas Golden Knights NHL team - which will play many more dates without benefit of an ice hockey heritage in the desert.

You may not get as much money if you are not selected on the first or second day of the draft.   However, it's not as big a risk now as draft picks have their money limited by the latest collective bargaining agreement.   The really big money comes in free agency after the initial contract.    (Ironically, it is sometimes better for a player not to be drafted in the late rounds, because as a free agent competing teams bid up the money for the player's services.)

Sometimes the kick happpens in their back just as they are running to keep in line.  Good luck with the call.

      "comment=It humorous to me that you have a hard time taking the tiger seriously when you apparently are okay with \"zombies.\"  Just an observation.  I found the first part of the episode tedious to watch.  It seemed like the whole first half of the episode was just setting up Sasha's death.  It was pretty clear from those \"in casket\" shots that at some point she does die, which makes all of the long flashbacks just not necessary for me.  They could have been shorter and more like flashes of memory than complete scenes with extended dialogue.  But, that's just me.  I expected the \"cavalry\" to arrive at some point, but was lured into thinking that maybe that would be the cliffhanger.  Rick and hes crew would be seen in the back of a dump truck headed to who knows where, whith the Hilltop and Kingdom people arriving just in time to see them drive off.  But, I was pleased with what they did.  It was pretty gratifying, but not completely so.  It was successful in that one wants to see what happens next.  After the horrific start of the second half of the season, this season ended up being pretty entertaining.  Not as good as some of the prior seasons, but good enough for me to tune in to see Negen meet his end.  Maybe.\n",

      "comment=WoW!  Faves:  We knew when Sasha asked for water that that was the end for her. Her heroic way of going out fighting.  The tiger!  The cavalry.  Negan shocked that Maggie is alive.  The moment Negan queries Eugene.  When Negan calls the hoarders \"garbage people.\" (But no offense.)  An attempt at seduction with blueberry pancakes.  But where is Gregory?  That weasel Dwight!\n",
      "response=Yes I neglected to mention Gregory. I figured he was a goner this week. But clearly he's wily enough to have taken charge of the Hilltop without possessing any other appreciable skills, so perhaps I underestimated him.\n",

      "comment=Did they show any walkers at the Saviors' compound?  I don't remember any.    Which kind of begs the question of the origin for the Times' picture of the gatuitously impaled walker that accompanies this review.  Don't remember seeing that - was it in a distant background shot that I missed?\n",
      "response=AMC provides those photos to the press in advance. It might have been a background shot, or maybe it was edited from the final version of the finale. Not sure. We removed it, at any rate, when we updated with newer photos from the episode, once those became available.\n",

      "comment=I would like to point out how blithely Ms. Spencer appropriated the suicide of a student about which she knew nothing, the information for which she received via hearsay. Clearly, she had this article written, and then she got wind of this student's passing and found it convenient for her purposes. She has no idea why that student took her life, and it's reprehensible for her to make the presumption of its connection to academic stress. Ms. Spencer: did you inquire as to the family's desires for privacy before you decided to include this fact? Did you even consider it? Including that information was callous, self-serving, and it perpetuates misunderstanding within this community about that student and her circumstances. You should be ashamed, as should the NY Times editors, and you should print an apology to the family and this community.\n",
      "response=This is Kyle Spencer, the reporter on this story. I'd like to respectfully respond to Mr. Walsh's comments, as they do not reflect the reporting process that went into this story, or the decision, on the part of the reporter and the editing staff, to make mention that Lexington lost a student to suicide this year.  Covering teen suicide is incredibly challenging, and no reporter does it without a lot of care. When I first came to Lexington, in late fall, I was told by parents that they were very worried they were going to lose a student to suicide. During my reporting, multiple sources expressed this worry. When I learned in late winter that a student had taken her life, I was very sad, and also challenged with what to do. I conferred extensively with reliable sources in Lexington about the incident, confirming all of the limited details we included in the story.    It was clear to us that a story about a town trying to prevent teen suicide would need to include the fact that a suicide in town had actually taken place. We decided that we would not make mention of the student's name - and that we would also make clear that the student had not been at the high school for very long. We did not try to interpret why the student took her life.  Finally, I was told by a reliable source that the mother of the student knew we were going to mention the incident and was appreciative we were not going to use her name.    Covering suicide is never easy. And I assure you that there was nothing cavalier about our process.\n",

      "response=Hi Rebecca, Our commenting system doesn’t recognize fancy spacing, so using words to create interesting shapes is, unfortunately, not an option for this challenge. Alternative fonts or text sizes aren't possible either.   If you want to send a few examples of student work to us to see, since we're always interested in seeing student work, you can email them to lnfeedback@nytimes.com.

      "comment=Yikes! From reading these comments, even college financial advisers sometimes give students bum advise. My daughter will start taking out student loans next fall and is planning to become a teacher. What is your advise on who to consult to make sure we set everything up just perfectly so that she will eligible for the loan forgiveness program? Are there accountants that specialize in helping students set up these kinds of loans? I'm afraid that even after reading the 56 question fact sheet, the tool kits, the Department of Education's website, and the lender website I still might mess something up. \n",
      "response=If it was my kid, I'd ask for help at financial aid, get her into FedLoan servicing right away, fill the certification form out every year, triple check everything every year or after every call, find someone at the school district (in HR or an older teacher) who knows this stuff cold, and get every, single thing in writing. And definitely read all the stuff I linked to, including the CFPB report from summer, which is a sort of catalogue of many (but not all!) of the many ways that this can go wrong. Good luck.\n",

      "comment=I'm one of those who's \"qualified\" for PSLF but not making qualifying payments....because I didn't know about the program until 6 years after school, and I'd been making the \"wrong\" kind of repayments. PSLF staff looked at my remaining debt and informed me that were I to change my repayment plan and begin making qualifying payments, my payment amount each month would double. At the end of 10 years time I'd have only a couple thousand left to forgive. In the meantime, the higher payments would eat into my ability to save for retirement and a house downpayment. The opportunity cost was just too high - I stayed with the longer, lower payment and will pay the amount in full. But that's what I assumed was the case when I took the loans out, so I'm not too bitter about it.  Bottom line: All student borrowers should be required to go through online training (a webinar would be easy enough to set up and administer) informing them of their choices and details of the various programs. And student borrowers whose loan forgiveness is declined after faithfully making repayments should sue the heck out of the DoE for misleading them all this time.\n",
      "response=In fact, the training you suggest -- counseling on the loans -- <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/25/your-money/the-problem-of-navigating-impenetrable-thickets-of-financial-aid-counseling.html?_r=0\">is already required ! But it doesn't seem to be doing enough good yet.\n",
      "comment 9\n",
      "comment=I'm not thrilled with the idea that only certain kinds of jobs qualify for loan forgiveness.  There should be a path to loan forgiveness for EVERYONE based on income and ability to pay.  No one wants to shirk repaying school loans.  But when college costs are exorbitant and loans are the only way to get an education and move forward in life - that's what they all say, anyway - then people are really between a rock and a hard place.  That's the American way, I guess.\n",
      "response=Other income-driven repayment programs do offer forgiveness to anyone, but the term is longer and the forgiven amount is taxable. (For now, at least. When people start running up IRS bills that they cannot pay, I expect a reckoning. But that won't happen for another several years at least.)\n",
      "comment 10\n",
      "comment=Reading these comments, many who qualify for forgiveness must make \"income based\" repayments, that pay the loan off in 10 years, hence nothing left to forgive.  What was the purpose of this law?\n",

Now, he’s got a balance of $40,000 and has missed out on years of eligibility for forgiveness.  This was a poor example. According to <a href=\"http://www.fedsdatacenter.com\" title=\"www.fedsdatacenter.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.fedsdatacenter.com , Mr. Amjadi makes $242K per year. He should pay back the $40K loan. It would be nice if he also paid back the federal government for his highly subsidized medical education. \n",
      "response=His salary would have something to do with the article if the article was about whether the program should have income caps or debt forgiveness caps.

I asked her if she had applied to an income driven repayment program (I had read an article) and she did not know what I was talking about. Being an accountant, I helped her through the application process and then asked her if she knew about loan forgiveness. Again she did not know what I was talking about.and again I stepped her through what she needed to do.  The government really needs to let these people know that these programs are available and give them assistance when they need it.\n",

      "comment=What is not addressed here is that the forgiven loan amount is then considered as taxable income.....  i was the financial aid director of a small college and i hated to process loans. i urged student to take less credits.. go at night while working and take longer to obtain  their degrees....   After they graduated.. students came back to me to thank me for prudent advice as compared to  their colleagues....  The student loan program when expanded  just caused colleges to raise tuition as they knew the money was not the object any longer.   The for profit colleges based their tuition on the sum of  maximum loan. maximum pell grant and maximum state grant....  \n",
      "response=No, it isn't taxable. Forgiven debt in the public service loan forgiveness program is not taxable, though it is going to be table (at least so far, vis a vis efforts to get this changed) in other income-driven payments plans that involve forgiveness at the end of their terms. And when a former financial aid director can't keep the rules straight, well, good luck to the teenagers interested in teaching or nursing who are trying to sort this all out ahead of time.\n",

Just stiff the lending or government agency that granted you a loan in full expectation of repayment. When the going gets tough, the students demand loan forgiveness. Our beneficent Governor Andrew Cuomo (a bleeding heart Democrat, with his eyes on the presidency in 2020), is going these deadbeats one better in the free stuff  race. He is apprpriating taxpayer money to give away free college tuition to the children of any family making less than $125,000 a year. As usual, the taxpayers who are footing the bill have no say or vote in the matter. No wonder people are leaving New York in droves. \n",

      "response=It's not clear why they set up the rules this way, but isn't it often the case that contractors make more money than government employees doing the same work (or who would have done the same work if only the work had not been contracted)? Perhaps this was why this happened -- or there was concern that higher-paid \"government\" work would unfairly be discharged.\n",

      "response=It's not unlike the explanation for the complexity of the tax code -- many of the income-driven repayment programs, kinds of loan, and types of exceptions and exceptions to the exception exist because the first set of things in that category caused problems for someone. (And yeah, some are there because of lobbyists.) Same thing is true for so many deductions and credits.

      "comment=4 years ago, while working as the Chief Information Officer at a state university in Illinois, I came to understand first hand of student loan debt.   Helping a few, and that turned into a flood. Borrowers are told to trust their servicers, without also being told about conflicts of servicer's interest, pending or settled litigation based upon servicer's behavior or how to validate the information given to them by a servicer is true. The program rules are complicated - but the easy mnemonic is 3Q's - qualified: plan, payments, employer.  1.  All qualified plans require annual re-certification.  If your loan payments don't require annual recertification,  you aren't in the kind of plan for forgiveness. 2.  All qualified loans must have \"Direct\" in the name of the loan.  If the loan doesn't say Direct, you can't be in a qualified plan though you are making payments. At the beginning of the forgiveness plan some servicers urged borrowers to consolidate FFEL loans because they were programmatically ineligible.  That was later fixed, but no one told those borrowers that they had a new way to become eligible for loan forgiveness. 3. Qualified payments means paying the qualified plan amount on-time every month.  Late payments don't count. 4.  Qualified employers.  Only 501(c)(3) firms qualify, however there are many categories of 501(c) - make sure your employer is a (3).   Research.  There are a lot of blogs about the programs and the rules.  CFPB has very clear information.\n",

Even extremely well-meaning people don't always have the right answers and may spend years inadvertently giving the wrong ones to people they are trying to help.   4) here is not true.

      "comment 18\n",
      "comment=Ron, do you see a relationship between the tuition rates skyrocketing and the loan programs? For me, it's a lot like car loans. With cars, people don't ask themselves, \"How much?\" They ask, \"How much per month?\" Americans have an average car payment of over $500/month over six years. With college, people have borrowed mindlessly. They ask, \"How much can I qualify for?\" and borrow the max, not only for tuition but for living expenses--in lieu of working. It's no wonder colleges and universities have increased costs as much as they can.\n",
      "response=I do believe there is a connection, but it is far from the only cause, and it's hard to tell just how much the programs are responsible for the increases -- and how much it is the decline in state funding at state schools (and whether they too lowered support in part because of the loan programs). Remember, for undergrad, the loans max out at 31k or so in most instances. Yes, parents can take PLUS loans, but not every parent will do that and some don't qualify. Yes, undergrads can get private loans, but only if a grownup cosigns. So the schools can't rely on loan availability alone in jacking up tuition rates. Many others things are at work.\n",

May women denied abortions sue all of the medical providers in her area who did not make that service available to them? Perhaps that is a good idea.   The truth is that one's right to die or reject medical care, even via proxy must be the law of the land. Not everyone wants to go through the pain and discomfort of medical activities that can sometime bring about continued life. Some people prefer not to cause their family the distress of dying at home versus in a place where death is common place. There has to come a time, in America when an adult and/or his/her proxy can request a DNR direction, even if the individual is not old or suffering from a fatal or severely disabling medical condition. One ought never be forced to live, if that is not the desire of that individual. I own myself and my body. Therefore, if I do not want to give birth or continuie living, that is my choice not the choice of the government or a medical facility. Perhaps law suits may bring about the freedom of owning one's own body and abortion on demand. \n",

      "comment=Regarding the MOLST order, it wasn't totally clear to me whether they gave a copy to the hospital.I think so, but the order has to be there, and the hospital has to have a protocol for storing and handling them to do any good. Also, many hospitals see advance directives more or less as contact information and the name of the person to contact if the hospital wants to withdraw life support. Sometimes even just for the name of someone to go to errands for the patient. That has been my experience. Basically I think they are seen by many hospitals and \"health care professionals\" as for their convenience -- helps lighten their load.  As far as the person suspected of abuse, I have also had that experience with a hospital -- being accused of abuse by a doctor I wanted off the case.  Have also had the experience of hospital trying to get patient (my mother) give them a different response to what I had indicated I wanted under health care directive. Keep in mind that many sick old people, like children, aim to please, and want to give \"right\" answer for approval, especially when in ICU. Always fascinated me that when my mother was competent but residents were too lazy to explain a procedure they wanted to do, they would call me instead of explaining it to her; but when I said something they didn't like they would go try to wake her up and get the answer they wanted.\n",

      "response=I contacted the Donor Network of Arizona about this concern that the patient’s organs should not be accepted. They sent me their process for assessing donations, including the medical screening that should be done. Here’s their medical criteria:  Organ Procurement Organizations are required to conduct the following infectious testing on all potential organ donors: HIV, Hepatitis B and C, VDRL/RPR (syphilis), cytomegalovirus (primarily transmitted in utero but can be opportunistic in immunocompromised patients), toxoplasmosis, and Epstein‐Barr virus. Donor Network of Arizona also tests for West Nile Virus and Chagas disease.  Information related to the donor’s medical history and current clinical picture is uploaded into the national transplant database. The transplant team considering the organ for a patient reviews the information when an organ is offered, and may ask questions or for additional testing until the transplant team ultimately decides to accept or decline the organ.  There is no requirement that the cause of death be known but all medical information must be given to the organization to determine acceptability. This was a young woman who was in good health. The MDs involved in her care thought she suffered an electrolyte abnormality due to her vomiting and that triggered an arrhythmia prolonged enough to injure the brain through loss of oxygen. Although not common, this is a more likely cause of death than the presence of a rare &amp; unsuspected genetic disease.\n",

      "comment=This article is misleading and irresponsible. Leaving an under-active thyroid untreated can cause people severe problems. There are no easy fixes and no medication fixes everything 100%, but without synthroid/levothyroxine the problems are much greater. Hypothyroidism is also not just a disease for older people either. I was diagnosed when I was 15 years old and for many years I didn't take the medicine regularly or seriously, and my symptoms increased and worsened. Finally, at the age of 21 or so I could hardly get out of bed or function and when my Dr. found out I wasn't taking the medicine regularly, she firmly told me how serious things could get for me. The difference in the way I felt after taking my synthroid consistently for only a week after that was so drastic, I never questioned taking the medicine again. Taking synthroid for under active thyroid is especially important for women who are pregnant or thinking of getting pregnant! It's wild there's no mention in this article of how this medicine is so important to those women. All I know is that I can barely function without my medicine. And, to suggest that diet and exercise can 'cure' hypothyroidism is so wrong.    \n",

I am shocked that this article is advising an all or nothing approach to patients Shouldn't we think less “If it helps you feel better, great.

I was diagnosed subclinical in my 20s and no doctor would treat me with medication for years citing Ms. Span's let's wait and see theory. I was still a skinny girl after all and had all my hair. They didn't seem to care about my mood or fatigue. I was finally put on Synthroid but my symptoms persisted and my numbers eventually climbed beyond subclinical. I learned about the T3 T4 differences and became interested in Armour Thyroid. The first three specialist literally laughed at me, and wouldn't test for anything other than TSH. I felt like Big Pharma was hovering overhead like in Orwell's 1984.   I finally found a great endocrinologist who tested for everything, and spent 40 minutes asking questions about symptoms. He sent me off for an ultrasound which confirmed a goiter others had denied and my Hashimotos diagnosis. He switched me to Armour Thyroid and within a few months the goiter was gone and I'd lost over 30 of the 40 lbs I'd gained.  I hope the doctors and author involved in this article will seriously reconsider their damage this advice may do if they do not clarify that there are alternatives to the one Big Pharma drug, levothyroxine.\n",

      "comment=The Times should take care to ensure that titles and summaries of health articles are accurate. The article’s title - Could Be the Thyroid; Could Be Ennui. Either Way, the Drug Isn’t Helping” - and the Times home page summary – “Levothyroxine has no significant effect for most who take it, according to a recent study” - are misleading and potentially hazardous. The article reports that older adults with \"subclinical hypothyroidism\" (mildly elevated TSH but normal thyroid hormone) derive no symptomatic benefit from levothyroxine. This conclusion, which was suspected from prior studies, is not surprising as symptoms associated with this condition are vague and non-specific - hence the term \"subclinical\" as opposed to \"clinical\" hypothyroidism.  This condition is distinguished from the more severe thyroid disorder termed \"overt\" or \"clinical hypothyroidism\" with more markedly elevated TSH, decreased thyroid hormone, and clear symptoms of thyroid deficiency. As the article rightly states, such individuals have a medical need for levothyroxine.  However, the article's title and summary ignore this key distinction, and causal readers may conclude that levothyroxine is generally ineffective. One can envision patients with clinical hypothyroidism petitioning their doctors to stop the medication - or deciding to do so themselves. Responsible journalism in health care should consider the consequences of article titles and avoid provocative statements designed to attract page clicks.\n",

Why don't we have universal health care--why do we play with our own safety and future by making it so difficult to get good health care? Henrietta Lacks story is very much looped into this deeper issue. It would be wise for Americans to realize that although the explosive issue with the Lacks family continues to be the money related to the use of Henrietta's cells, the difficulty in getting good health care was a considerable problem that ensnares all Americans long after her death.\n",

Our patients were grateful for the care they were given and they were respectful of the doctors providing it 24/7. Many of our patients lived in Penn station and were frequently readmitted to the hospital. My salary was $15,000 per year x2 for an 80 hour week. Early on in private practice I learned that families of some private patients who were critically ill tended to think that if their loved ones got better it was God’s will and if they didn’t it must have been the doctor’s fault. This thinking conveniently made billions for our nation’s trial lawyers. I also found the NYT comments on medically related issues to also be mostly ignorant! Many people believe they don’t need doctors, they just need to eat the right food and exercise. Why didn’t I think of that? If I walk into a health food store for a cure for baldness, they will sell me something. When it works, other bald men will notice and soon enough there will be no bald men! Same for fat people and miracle diets! How did I miss those? A doctor should be able to diagnose and fix a human just like a skilled airplane tech can fix a plane. No differences there!

First it makes too much sense, returns prescribing choices to medical professionals, and might return their focus to drug efficacy and availability as opposed to gouging all concerned for the almighty bottom line.  I worked in pharma for a number of yrs.  The lion's share of budget always, without fail went to marketing at the expense of research.

No. Several years ago I worked with a first-time mother who couldn't stand to leave her child so, after three months of maternity leave, she came back to work and brought the baby with her. It was a disaster for everyone but her. She spent all her time tending to the baby. Other co-workers constantly streamed in and out of her cubicle to visit and play. Deadlines were missed. Meetings were skipped. The few of us who weren't enthralled by the baby and didn't care to hold it or help feed and change it were ridiculed and ostracized, which created even more tension in the office. In the end, our vice president had to put the kibosh on babies in the office.\n",

Iran gets Hezbollah and Hamas to do its fighting in Syria.  6. Saudi Arabia (mostly Sunni) hates Iran (mostly Shia) and supports the rebels. Some Americans want the rebels to be called terrorists. Hmmm, were those Mississippi rebs in our Civil War actually terrorists?  7. Legitimate terrorist groups (first al-Qaeda, then major segments of ISIS) see a vacuum and use it to their advantage.  8. Sunnis, Shiites, and Christians who co-existed tenuously before the Arab Spring, now can't get along at all (typical religious reaction).  9. Kurds -- perhaps the only sane group in the milieu -- want their own state.  10.

It is by no means a policy statement.  The strike, at a minimum, cost the U.S. taxpayers something like $70,000,000.

      "comment=What goes on in Kim's mind? Given the grave situation one should put aside all prejudices and one should also not to be afraid to be politically incorrect. So if people will call my explanation  racist, I challenge them to come up  with a better one.  Koreans, and many Asians, are good in copying. They focus on it. Kim or North Korea, are copying the components of the nuclear deterrence forces developed by the US and Russia. It is well known that use of these forces was considered  to be in no one's interest, as shown by the acronym MAD for 'mutually assured destruction'.   This dependence on copying instead of creativity may result in an inferiority complex and envy in some Asians (compare the envy of Jewish creativity by antisemites). Most inventions and new cultural developments have been the work of Caucasians, by Europeans in the past, and mostly white Americans at present. I once read in a book on WWII that during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia many Indonesians thought that Japan could never win the war because they 'only could copy', and could not invent such as the whites could.   Moreover, many people are guided by the wish to be a celebrity, to be important, to be in the spotlight. Kim's nuclear arsenal puts him in the spotlight. He will be noticed. So that may be his motivation as well.  Given that Kim has little regard for human life, including the lives of his own people, the situation is grave, and indeed getting worse.   I hope I am wrong.\n",

The \"ad\" was to possibly influence the leader of China to commit to action when he visits the \"southern white house\" later this week. Mass media picks up the story, which is fear-mongering.

They continue and, in some cases, get worse.  If there is a way to take advantage of a handicapped adult, especially one who has autism, it will be done.  If it's to a person's advantage to portray someone like my brother as a danger that will be done.  If there's a way to say he's a sexual predator even though he's not, that's done too.    What I've learned is that normal people are more of a danger to my brother than he is to any of them.  Even the police don't know how to deal with someone like my brother.  Even seasoned educators prefer to call the police rather than tell him to his face to leave them alone.  It's not enough to introduce a Muppet that is autistic to a children's show:  how about introducing a few adults who are autistic to serious adult shows?   \n",

      "comment=Could this lesson be applied to marriage? The author writes: \"Experience surrogates are best used as proxies for our future selves. So instead of asking surrogates for information as inputs to our imagination, we instead ask questions about their goals and actual experience...\"  What if, before getting married or popping the big question, we could interview our beloved's ex-spouse or ex-lovers? That would tank an immense amount of hutzpah, for sure, but it could reveal more objective information about our (prospective) future spouse than most other methods of evaluation. Of course, doing so without the consent and support of one's beloved (unlikely) would entail great risks. For that reason, I'd guess this approach is rare.  My second wife and I have been happily married now for almost 15 years. Even so, I wish I had made better choices about marrying my first wife, including paying attention to \"experience surrogates.\" Perhaps that would have prevented a lot of pain and heartache, not to mention the trauma of divorce. Thank God that is all in the evermore distant past.\n",

As reference, in Germany you have to pay about $4 per kid per meal (may differ bit) and those who can't afford it, get it at a reduced price or for free. Usually in a way that is not visible to others so kids don't know who can afford it and who can't.

      "comment=Ah, teenage privacy! (And with most preteens owning cell phones, them as well.) The constant evolution of electronic communication and social media have made it damn near impossible for parents to keep up. Not that long ago it was AOL instant messaging, then texting and Facebook. Preteen parents: did you know your kids are communicating in Pinterest chatrooms?  Once they know you do, they'll move on to something else.  Good face-to-face communication with your kids is best, but more and more difficult when everyone is looking at screens and not at each other. It used to be - back when dinosaurs roamed the earth - that parents had a sense of what was going on with their children because the house phone rang. Some of my best conversations with my children when they were teenagers were in the car, a captive audience who didn't need to make eye contact.  Now kids are having multiple conversations silently on their devices. I know of too many tragedies that families have faced that might have been avoided if parents knew their children were receiving harassing phone calls from exes, were talking about how hopeless they felt, were being bullied and controlled romantic partners and friends.  Snooping is OK, and let your children know that you may snoop. Talk to them about things that concern you. Learn how to moderate your snooping so that you aren't microscopically reading everything, but only checking in. They may not like it, but it isn't your job as a parent to be liked.\n",

More white men than black are killed by police every year, though black people are disproportionately brutalized in comparison to their percentage in the general population. And of course, the rest of his rationale was played for humor.   As for Maia, is the author implying that disadvantaged children would never turn a blind eye to their parents' wrongdoing out of loyalty and love? Ridiculous.

I look at my clients - their youth and potential slipping away as they become involved with a punishing legal system.  Treatment is the answer, but treatment only works when there is long term involvement with the patient as well as other services - vocational/ ed, mental health, healthcare.  The items that no one wants to pay for.  We just dodged a bullet, when the ACA was sparred.  90% of our patients in the outpatient agency I am working for are covered by Medicaid and ACA.  When the republicans 'succeed' at ruining ACA and Medicaid that 90% will be without counseling or Case management and will return to the streets, where they will  be arrested and thrown in jail.  So, where does America want to spend their money - for treatment or the Criminal Justice System?  Society needs to spend money on alternative programs such as Diversion and Drug Courts, which monitor clients for almost 2 years and make sure they receive the services that they need to succeed in Recovery.    But these are very expensive alternatives to incarceration.  Better to spend more money on these types of courts, on treatment, on mental health counseling as well on  on addiction medication (Vivotrol shots in particular) than on jails and prisons. \n",

Let us not forgot the beginning of \"Idiocracy\", in which the poor family, which was portrayed as dumb and trashy, was procreating out of control. The intelligent and educated couple waits, struggles, then eventually has a single child. This is the setup to explain how things get where they are in 2505 -- \"dumb\" people breeding like rabbits, and \"smart\" people not. Eventually this imbalance turns the country into a society full of morons.  I would suppose that outside of the context of this article, most liberal-minded folks (myself included) would find the insinuation that poor = dumb offensive. For some reason, this film seems to get a pass. We surely give conservatives and The Republican Party a lot of flack for their siding with the wealthy and privileged and valuing a person's wealth as a major metric of his worth. Isn't that effectively what \"Idiocracy\" is doing?  As an aside, \"set[ting] aside\" \"King of the Hill\" is a huge mistake. That is the best thing Judge has done.\n",

While it's a shame to see waste of food by some of Chinese (go to Chinese restaurants in Chinese concentrated US/Canada cities, especially among young people), people should also understand the cultural aspect. Chinese love to eat and eat good food. It can be reflected in the idiom of “ \"People are the most important to an emperor, while foods are the most important to the people”, or the equivalent of hello in Chinese \"have you eaten\" (in old days). When people now can afford to eat well, don't you think they'd go full force to do so? What's shame is they now eat Americans in a mass production and consumption way.

Lots of young women were used and abused by this pattern and even though everyone at the newspapers where he worked knew about his behavior, nothing ever happened until someone decided to go public.

Has Munoz ever flown economy on a United flight over Christmas? I doubt it.  Ever try to call or contact the executives at most companies? Impossible. The last thing these people want to do is actually talk to customers. Ever.   They won't even hire a senior staff to take customer input directly. They hire some polling company to do Customer Satisfaction Surveys and ask only about the one employee I might have encountered.  Oh, if you happen to belong to the same country club they do or attend a high society function with them, you might get their ear for a few seconds.   You are lucky if you can even reach an overseas call center, where your comments, ideas, and suggestions fall on deaf ears.  Because too many CEO's not only never listen to customers directly, they never listen to the employees on the front lines either.  This is something the best CEO's do routinely. Ed Kelliher actually flew Southwest Airlines. Steve Jobs visited Apple stores. It's called \"Management By Walking Around\". No entourage, no advanced warning, no $1,000 suits and $600 shirts.  Just one human being interacting with another, as a typical customer might.

Obviously if you are sincerely sorry this would not be a deterrent — if you are truly sorry you would jump at the chance to make things right and the monetary and other consequences should not be of any significance — but I believe that legal protection does factor into the way most corporate apologies are phrased.\n",

I think that \"hating math and science\" is behind a lot of the \"anxiety\"---people from their earliest days are taught to NOT like them.  Some normal parents probably refrain from helping their children to learn math through everyday experiences because....goodness, talking about how numbers relate to each other might cause their kids to be \"abnormal\" socially.  The social stigma around math needs to change in order for people to allow themselves---and their children---to be comfortable with math, even finding it fun.  At this point, people, especially young women, go out of their way to proclaim their \"normalcy\" by embracing math aversion, and parents reward this by paying for things like T-shirts that say \"I'm too cute to do math\", etc.  What do you expect young children to think when their big sisters advertise anti-math sentiments? \n"

At least The Governor had a little backstory about loving his daughter which seemed to at least partially justify his madness. I'd love to know what people think Negan did before the ZA?

That sounded like I'd be covered for all 3 years. 6 months later I was asked the same question, how much do you want to take out? That was another $9k, again thinking I was done. Another 6 months later I was asked the same question. It was then that I only took out enough to cover my tuition and I went and worked full time. I am not using my film degree as I had the unfortunate luck to graduate in 2008 when the economy crashed and I couldn't find a job. I took a min wage job and was expected to pay $1k per month when I only made $1500 and was told by Sallie Mae, clearly make more than your monthly payment there is nothing we can do. Now all I want is to lower my interest rate so I have a chance to pay these off in my lifetime. But have been told on numerous occasions there is nothing they can do for me.\n",

The trauma of these ODs will be felt for future generations.  We are creating a generation of \"at-risk\" children every time a script is written.

Lots of traditional cultures subsisted largely on meat, but the fuzzy Waltons image trendy America has of what is right and proper in eating evokes sylvan unspoiled fields rich with pulses and herbs, so that becomes the new normal in eating (until the next generational change).   I'm all for home pickling, but let's not forget the large amounts of salt and harsh vinegars, and often sugar, needed to preserve food in a traditional way. Freezing technology permitted keeping food as long without the agents needed to keep it from spoiling.   How much sugar and calories are in crunchy granola, or carrot cake/muffins  (another 60s legacy?) How much starch is there in bean-based dishes, hence calories?   And how do you (author) know that hippies didn't win the election? Why is that even a relevant statement in the context of a food article? Did the JFK White House subsist on the kind of fare described in this article? I doubt it...\n",

What strikes me is that, according to my sense of how the world works, both are clearly impossible. As are most of the JFK assassination  theories. And yet there are plenty of people who find many of these theories plausible. (But I really doubt if there are many subscribers to the pedophile ring fantasy.) I don't see it as being a question of education - or at least, not academic education. The reasons they seem impossible to me have more to do with a general experience, over quite a few years now, of how plans actually work, or more often, don't work, how the government operates, and so on - leading to a sense that most of what people sense is wrong with society is actually right out in the open. I wonder if people drift away from conspiracy theories with age and experience? \n",

To me, it is disturbing that anyone would believe that Clinton operated a pedophile ring.

Is the government paying for his premiums for that whole family?\"   Mr. Ahmed does a job that would put most Americans in the hospital.  Ever tried working in a tiny kitchen without air-conditioning? (I have!)  Food, licensing, fines, and labor are not free.    This is the problem with our country right now.  Coal miners, cooks, custodians, and teachers work really hard.  We literally damage our health and well-being to provide for our families and to make a positive contribution.  We’ve been “divided and conquered” by the .01% that reap the benefits of our labor, but who don’t compensate us for the work that we do.  Our society depends on people like Mr. Ahmed, but it doesn’t compensate them in kind.  I usually work 60 hours a week.  I am on my feet most of the day, and am constantly planning for future demand, and dealing with really upset people (most of them jerks).  My commute is a nightmare, and I barely make enough money to afford a 700 square foot apartment for my family.    I’m a tenured professor at CUNY.\n",

      "\tcountry=US, location=New York, NY, comment=Thank you for your article.  For me, you raised some important salient philosophical questions.  What does it mean exactly to have an identity, to be black or white?  Can I be black simply because I see it so?  Or is being black the product of what others say.  I think that the problem of white privilege is important, but it does not solve the ambiguity of identity itself, but rather assumes it.  First and foremost, identity is not something actual, at least not in the ordinary sense of the term.  You cannot find a person's identity like you find a thing.  The only existence of identity seems to consist in the agreement of our perceptions over time.  On the other hand, identity is not just a perception but also refers to one's role with others, which is dependent, in turn, upon their perceptions.  So, in that sense telling Dolezal she is not black has some justification.  But the whole thing is very confusing, especially when you consider that we also use 'labels' that are sociologically derived, that we are supposed to internalize somehow.  To identify as black (or white) amounts to a setting of limits for the validity of one's own conscious experience of the world and themselves; but it is also an unavoidable feature of living in the world.  One does not choose to be black after all.  Over time all of these identities are changing and we can remain confident that they will continue to.  So being black is also a new horizon.\n",

Once the 'party of the people,' it became dominated by an Ivy League-educated elite that is focused only on individual rights, and only in certain areas.

It is a party that a Cheryl Sandberg would be most comfortable with, but not common people.  Despite \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" the dystopia that America could become is an authoritarian plutocracy.  Our economy became increasingly extractive over the past 40 years, with a corresponding reduction in labor rights, most notably arbitration law and workplace surveillance.  Because the monied donors to the Democrats are often financiers and business owners themselves, don't expect the gentry liberals to get serious about income inequality and labor issues any time soon.  The big question is:  Who represents the people?

That last happened shortly after Pearl Harbor.   Bush the Younger asked the UN Security Council to exercise its Chapter VII war powers but the UNSC said no. So Bush just did it anyway. (Bush didn't utterly ignore the UNSC -- he claimed he was authorized to attack Iraq based on some old UNSC resolutions left over from when his dad had been President; to use a mild adjective, most of us considered that argument to be \"unconvincing.\")  Presidents don't ask Congress to declare war any more, but they DO sometimes ask Congress for authorization, always reserving the right to act without Congressional authorization if need be. But the Presidents who ask for that authorization already know how Congress will vote; if they didn't, they wouldn't ask in the first place. Thus, Obama knew Congress would say \"no\" in 2013, and so he was more than happy to ask Congress. \"No,\" after all, is the answer Obama wanted and agreed with (I did too). For another example, Bush the Younger asked for Congress' authorization to attack Iraq, and got it -- including Hillary's \"yes\" vote. Clinton later said she was against the Iraq War, but she voted FOR it when she was asked (some of us remember that, and were disgusted that she was labeled the \"peace candidate\" last year.)\n",

The Murdoch-Ailes strategy was successful  on riding--indeed fomenting--the criticism of Liberals.  That is all it did and all it could do.  FOX monetized and largely owned the art of scurrilous shrieking round-the-clock at liberalism as the worst of all political evils, while proposing right-wing conservatism as the salvation for American society.  The deep state of ugly manipulation and deceit, long known but now visible with the lecherous shenanigans of Ailes and O'Reilly (and their managerial enablers), was woven into FOX's success.  FOX's forte hinged on the slick manipulation of popular anxieties by fomenting racists, sexist, and xenophobic mouth-frothing politics.  Cleaning up house means cleaning up this culture--which thrived on (and many say, damaged) the resurgence of populist conservatism.  Can--indeed, will--the cleanup under the management of the Murdoch sons retain the dumbed down audience that has been cultivated over two decades?  Maybe: but their numbers are dwindling.

Most women who wait a very long to have children are AMBIVALENT....they are reluctant to give up their life style or freedom to have children.

My stepdaughter is trying to get pregnant for the last 18 months, unsuccessfully so far (but who knows?). She is 39 and will be 40 in about a month. She was married two years ago, at 37, to a young man whom she had lived with for 3 years -- been engaged to for almost TWO years -- they already had bought a house together. She has a degree and a very excellent, high paying job.   So why did she wait? Why have a long engagement, when you are already 35? (they were already living together more than a year). Why wasn't a degree, a house, a marriage, etc. enough to start on a family? (Yes, her husband is equally degreed and has a terrific job.)  The reason is AMBIVALENCE. The stepdaughter enjoyed a long adolescence, being free to travel and take any sort of job. She took 9 years to get a bachelor's degree. So many young women in our culture are DISCOURAGED from childbearing, and told to pursue glamorous careers and \"lean in\" -- so they never develop the skills or interest necessary for the dedicated, demanding JOB of being a mom.

There is a strong history of breast cancer in my wife's family. It was stunning when she recently discovered that she had none of the major genetic markers (she is over 20 years out). Other markers may surface in future decades. She went through testing for our children, who were having daughters of their own, as a guide to whether our older son should be tested further. None of this was feasible for most of my medical career (I retired in early 2007.).   Beyond intellectual discussions of risk, how soon should a child be tested for those genetic factors? That still depends on parental decisions. Why should a child worry for years over something that may be approached entirely differently when they reach adulthood?

The will to live is powerful.  Clearly, that is what drove me to battle every illness, surgery, and misdiagnosis. Finally, the will to live drove me to do my own research. It took one year.  I read every medical textbook on embryology I could find. I subscribed to every medical journal I determined to be of scientific value. Many were in a different language, so I paid for the translations. After six decades of hell, and suffering countless insults from \"doctors\" about my physical agonies, I graphed on my office wall exactly what had collapsed in my embryonic development. Now, I had \"street cred.\" After a 16 hour surgery with four surgeons from four different departments at the Cleveland Clinic and then a ten hour surgery, my life was saved.

But we knew is was him by the clothing he wears at the restaurant. What a \"hiding in plain sight moment.\"  And there has to be something in the actual first time that we see Gus, face to face with Jimmy - who has just extracted his head from the garbage can - also foreshadowing of things to come between them?\n",

(ala the fact that the stock didn't start to slide in the time it takes Wendy to get to lower Manhattan from wherever Axe Capital is located - would take her at least an hour if not two, no? - if the financial press already knows about the illnesses the stock would have turned by then. And the bit about the order coming in through the small brokerage and the \"implications\" of that was also a bit forced etc etc ). But anyway, who cares.  I was completely duped and loved it.  Happily have \"Even the Losers\" stuck in my head. So sad that next week is the end of the season.  Wendy's short is going to be problematic for the run for Albany...

If Chuck's trust was worth $16M, who would risk that to bait Axe so that maaaybe he'll convict him, and become Governor? (Especially with his S&amp;M history...) Furthermore in the process, Chuck screws his best friend, who bailed his butt out with the AG, his wife, and father; (...to say nothing of the Ice Juice staff).  Additionally, how is using Bogosian's character's 'tip' not legally baiting Axe, how can Chuck ever hope to have the trust of his staff after not telling them about the deception, and how could Dake possibly get all this 'perfect' surveillance put in place within 3 days?  To say nothing of Axe's uncharacteristically very risky behavior.  All a bit dubious.  One thing is for sure, IJ is bankrupt. Of the two type A's males here, both of whom can be deplorable, kudos to the show's staff for making the 'good' guy more despicable than the 'bad' one. Giamatti's excellent performance sold the set-up, even if it doesn't the plot doesn't bear total scrutiny.  The character of Taylor is a wonderful juxtaposition to the hyper-stylized male world they inhabit.\n",

      "\tcountry=US, location=New York, comment=In 2008, a prominent economist well-known in New York and Washington estimated that National Infrastructure would cost close to $4 Trillion.  He had started addressing The House of Representatives and The Senate on the Rebuilding of America in the mid-90s.  It was well received and to my recollection there were few detractors when it came to this matter.  President Obama, having inherited two wars and a massive recession, was able in respond by creating the National Infrastructure Bank with circa $800 Million in funds.  Not only necessary for the benefit of restoring safe bridges and tunnels for transportation, it would create jobs.  If some of us commute by train into Grand Central Station, the crumbling infrastructure is visible to the eye.  There have been railroad accidents with casualties that could have been averted.  What is the solution because there are no quick-fixes?  This administration will first have to get its act together.  Mass confusion is rampant among the Public and we are being bombarded in all directions with calls for action.  The Trump Administration appears to be ill-prepared to handle this growing need.

Even more attractive is closing the loopholes which allow companies like Apple and GE to escape a fair tax burden; and changing the personal tax code so that the likes of Carl Icahn (and Donald Trump) pay at least the same rate of taxes as my dentist.\n",

This is equivalent to a traffic ticket to regular folks.  What is it about banking that you cannot be held accountable for your crimes?  In 2008 Wells Fargo (and others) collapsed the economy by giving out loans to just about anyone, and many who they know were ridiculously unqualified. I had a painter that worked for at $25/hr who was able to get two mortgages  for $850,000. The banks then sold these mortgages as grade A to others when they were all but junk. Utter fraud, amount of people arrested = 0.  I had worked 80 hrs a week my whole life so I could retire as a contractor, I had everything in real estate. So in 2008 I lost everything, my credit ruined, and because my mortgages were on auto bill pay, Wells Fargo put me on a criminal list and I was unable to open even a $10 savings account after that.   I had worked very hard, built homes for people to live in, my life was destroyed by bank fraud, more ironically the banks who perpetuated this fraud were bailed out, the victims were not. On top of that my credit is destroyed and I am put on a list. The criminals gave themselves huge bonuses that year, their credit was unmolested, and none of them have ever been held accountable.

The “Jewish State” of Israel, intended as a safe haven for Jews after centuries of pogroms, expulsions, forced conversions and genocide, is now rejected by many as oppressive and anti-democratic. <br/><br/>Never mind that the Palestinians rejected at least four offers for their own state (in 1937, 1948, 2001 and 2008); never mind that in 1948, just as thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from Israel, thousand of Jews fled or were expelled from neighboring Arab countries into Israel; never mind the wars, airplane hijackings, intifadas, attacks on civilians, suicide bombings and missile launches intended to destroy Israel. <br/><br/>Make no mistake, they may call it anti-Zionism, but it’s the new form of Anti-Semitism. Bottom line, it’s a subversive attempt to delegitimize and eventually destroy the Jewish State in the name of “modern progressive” values.

That seems less like protection than exploitation of the vulnerable.  Most of us would be unable to list the \"prevent death\" measures we would agree with and those we would deny the use of; our families or our authorized personal health care representatives or judges would be unable as well to understand the steps from minor technological interventions to technology controlling all bodily functions as happened to the patient described in the article.<br/><br/>One point that Dr. Lahey does not emphasize enough is that appropriate palliative care which I assume includes controlling pain is not given to all people with intellectual disabilities at the end of life.  The focus on abuse of drugs by the general population has made pain control medication much more difficult to prescribe.

That last happened shortly after Pearl Harbor.   Bush the Younger asked the UN Security Council to exercise its Chapter VII war powers but the UNSC said no. So Bush just did it anyway. (Bush didn't utterly ignore the UNSC -- he claimed he was authorized to attack Iraq based on some old UNSC resolutions left over from when his dad had been President; to use a mild adjective, most of us considered that argument to be \"unconvincing.\")  Presidents don't ask Congress to declare war any more, but they DO sometimes ask Congress for authorization, always reserving the right to act without Congressional authorization if need be. But the Presidents who ask for that authorization already know how Congress will vote; if they didn't, they wouldn't ask in the first place. Thus, Obama knew Congress would say \"no\" in 2013, and so he was more than happy to ask Congress. \"No,\" after all, is the answer Obama wanted and agreed with (I did too). For another example, Bush the Younger asked for Congress' authorization to attack Iraq, and got it -- including Hillary's \"yes\" vote. Clinton later said she was against the Iraq War, but she voted FOR it when she was asked (some of us remember that, and were disgusted that she was labeled the \"peace candidate\" last year.)\n",

If she'd won, she'd either have had to flip-flop (which she's been known to do -- for example, on gay marriage, the Keystone XL Pipeline, and the TPP) or start shooting down Russian planes. The latter would have created a serious risk of thermonuclear war with Russia. Launching 59 Tomahawk missiles to explode harmlessly in the desert, especially after warning the Russians that you're planning to do so, poses a much smaller risk.  On the other hand, HRC predictably would have done nothing to goad China into taking some action against North Korea. NK is principally China's concern, not ours, but at some point we have a right to insist that China take SOME action, and that that action take account of the risk that NK poses not only to China but to South Korea, the US, and the rest of the world.

      "\tcomment=Brilliant show by all who worked on  it. However, doesn't it undercut the series central thesis?  Davis, Hepburn, and Page all received nominations for playing middle aged woman and Bancroft won for a part which can be played by a woman of nearly every age.  Patti Duke, who was the real star of The Miracle Worker was placed in the supporting category because she was seen as too young to be a lead actress. If Crawford and Davis's careers flailed, how much of their problems were due to Holywood's alleged distaste for older woman stars. and how much of their problems were due to their own choices? After all Hepburn was their contemporary and made some of her best movies (and a few stage appearances) after 1963.  Both Davis and Crawford (at least according to this series) were drinking heavily, and Crawford does not seem to be able to get through three hours with out a belt.  Both Davis and Crawford are shown as behaving unprofressionally, or sometimes just foolishly.  \n",

Another matter: I love this show, and thought \"Breaking Bad\" a near masterpiece, and I appreciate Jonathan Bank's performance as Mike in both. But in this forum, and others, praise for him seems effusive.  Mike is laconic, to be sure, but that character trait is becoming, for me, a tad one dimensional. It fosters underacting, which can be just as poor a choice as overacting.  Vince Giliggan should allow Banks to do more, or force him to.\n",

He has told Carrie goodbye, and she has let go. (And from the point of view of narrative, where can this storyline go, given Quinn's terrible injuries?)  I sure hope I am wrong.

He had started addressing The House of Representatives and The Senate on the Rebuilding of America in the mid-90s.  It was well received and to my recollection there were few detractors when it came to this matter.  President Obama, having inherited two wars and a massive recession, was able in respond by creating the National Infrastructure Bank with circa $800 Million in funds.  Not only necessary for the benefit of restoring safe bridges and tunnels for transportation, it would create jobs.  If some of us commute by train into Grand Central Station, the crumbling infrastructure is visible to the eye.  There have been railroad accidents with casualties that could have been averted.  What is the solution because there are no quick-fixes?  This administration will first have to get its act together.  Mass confusion is rampant among the Public and we are being bombarded in all directions with calls for action.  The Trump Administration appears to be ill-prepared to handle this growing need.

Start with health care, then private education, and on from there.  Then, use Mr. Ballmer's site, or any similar site, and compare the difference.  We all know that single payer healthcare is infinitely more cost-effective than any private insurance can possibly be.  How will Bill O Reilly (assuming he's not incarcerated) or Alex Jones or Rush Limbaugh or Ann Coulter spin it when we finally have nonpartisan, quantifiable evidence that, contrary to the alternative news universe, government actually does many many things better than private business.  For widgets, stuff, things, objects, the market may function adequately.  When it comes to serving people in ways that require qualitative values - such as in health and education, to name just two examples - the market is a miserable failure.  Demonstrate this and you will have a political revolution. \n",

      "\tcomment=This is all fine and dandy, except for the fact that these people made hundreds of millions of dollars, and apparently won't be indicted for committing a crime. This is equivalent to a traffic ticket to regular folks.  What is it about banking that you cannot be held accountable for your crimes?  In 2008 Wells Fargo (and others) collapsed the economy by giving out loans to just about anyone, and many who they know were ridiculously unqualified. I had a painter that worked for at $25/hr who was able to get two mortgages  for $850,000. The banks then sold these mortgages as grade A to others when they were all but junk. Utter fraud, amount of people arrested = 0.  I had worked 80 hrs a week my whole life so I could retire as a contractor, I had everything in real estate. So in 2008 I lost everything, my credit ruined, and because my mortgages were on auto bill pay, Wells Fargo put me on a criminal list and I was unable to open even a $10 savings account after that.   I had worked very hard, built homes for people to live in, my life was destroyed by bank fraud, more ironically the banks who perpetuated this fraud were bailed out, the victims were not. On top of that my credit is destroyed and I am put on a list. The criminals gave themselves huge bonuses that year, their credit was unmolested, and none of them have ever been held accountable.   Do we live in a republic? Absolutely not. \n"

Any attempt at reasoning the vote gets drowned in the chants of social justice, misogyny, racism and God knows what. Progress is a good thing but nyt has to realize that trying to suppress the voice of half the country is just regressive by any standards. Why exactly is Obama still liked? There's an article title that people want - he had eight years to effect change and ended up with 60 million dollars. So don't tell me after 4 months that Trump is the anti-christ. \n",

Many of the reasons are that they are had opportunity to get better EDUCATION, they are successful in their business etc, or  they inhere money.  Those who are able to raise more money because their wealth feel compel to distribute their donations with other less fortunate. However often many claim to be good Christians, but they do not seem to understand one of the principles of Christianty.  Additionally if they are able to educate better all their children in their school district by sharing, they will be creating a better society for their children that they \"CARE\" so much. Their families are benefiting from these donations. Yes as many have written, the problem it is the education system, more than the teachers I blame the administrators. I have proposed that the PTA demand accountability in a constant basis to the administrators and ask for proven justifications for their decisions. Many of them never benefit the children. Their is the main problem of education in America. The more disparity in education the more problems to society. Look at  those countries with high crime, poverty. What is their level of education and productivity? Slowly but surely with are moving in that direction with the present administration.\n",

      "\tcomment=During one of our many trips to New York City when my boys were much younger, we visited Wall street and viewed the bull close up.  What we saw was a raging bull representing the power of money and the bull market of Wall Street.  There was nothing in the bull that conveyed love or peace or even freedom in the world, unless one refers to the destructive freedom of unfettered capitalism.  What the Fearless Girl does for the bull is change it from a mere Wall street logo into actual art.  Now there is a dynamic and a story;  Will the girl tame the bull, or will the bull react in blind male fury as it's creator appears to have and destroy the beautiful?  Is Mr. Di Modica disturbed that the girl elevates his work?   It is really a shame that Mr. De Modica has decided a piece he created as \"public art\" is now his inviolate personal statement.  As an artist, he should know this is not how art functions.  Perhaps he is most concerned about his copyrights and trademarks.  He needs to remember he placed his work in a public space and the girl is a separate sculpture.  He does not have the rights of curator in his own personal museum.  The little girl has as much or more right to be on Wall Street as his bull.  Maybe it is time to remove the bull and keep the Fearless Girl.\n",

It is obvious the media fawns all over these images of urban unrest and black rage.  There was a photo of a pretty young black women in a dress walking up to riot police that got a lot of coverage.  At that point in time I was already cynical of the self consciousness of so many of these acts and therefore was unimpressed.  There is a symbiotic relationship between protesters and the media- they both enhance their value when imagines like that are captured and both act to produce those moments that will go down in history as a symbol of something. Manipulative, passive agressive and exploitative for power and self agrannization. So the outrage at Pepsi is kind of ironic. Yes  the commercial was cringe worthy, contrived, and exploitative.  But you know what else is? The media fawning all over these activists, the constant false narratives, and maudlin activist addiction to seeing themselves as martyrs. Activists shrewdly exploiting false narratives and the media for fame and profit are outraged when Pepsi does the same.  It's all funny in a nauseating way.  The era we live in will not make anyone look good, if it is portrayed accurately in the future. As for now,  we can't depend on activists or the media for accuracy any more then Pepsi.\n",

Could Assad's air strike have been a regular one and the terrorists released the chemicals during the strike to weaken the Syrian regime's position?

He was conspicuously unmoved --- sometimes proudly so --- by any of this. Never mind the \"children of God\": Mr. Trump saw the gas attack for what it was: an effort to test the new president, and a gesture of contempt towards the impotence of the West and the USA. I have little doubt that this is what he is reacting to. Whether cratering an empty airfield has any real effect is another matter. Assad is a pathologically brutal figure, but so is Mr. Sisi who smiled with Mr. Trump in a photo op the other day. I'd be glad to see Assad come to a bad end, but I doubt there's any viable plan to achieve that particular \"remove and replace\".

His audience is aging, but still very large. His viewers don't care about the sexual harassment allegations, which have been in the news for years.   With regard to the allegations, which involve serially propositioning women often decades younger than him, I have to wonder, has O'Reilly looked in a mirror lately? He's 67 years old and looks it. Does he not see his jowls, his neck wattle, liver spots, wrinkles, doubtful hairline and aging, slack body? Does he actually see himself as sexually attractive to young women, much less a player?   When did movement conservatism in the United States - which once loudly scorned the tawdry skirt-chasing of Ted Kennedy, among other liberals - give a pass to the pathological harassment of women practised so blatantly by the likes of Ailes, O'Reilly and Trump? When did chronic sexual harassment among presidential candidates and right-wing media figures become acceptable behaviour to conservative, self-proclaimed guardians of American morality (except when it impacts ad revenues, apparently)?  \n",

With zero guidance/help from them, I graduated at the top of my high school class and attended an ivy league school where I did well.  I visited college campuses MYSELF or with a friend.  I attended tours alone or with a friend.  Now, as a parent, I’ve walked college campuses with my elementary/middle school children, in conjunction with family vacations.  We don’t take the official tours (my kids are still young) but it’s important to show them various campuses and discuss the similarities/differences of various schools and the towns/cities those schools are in, etc.  If you start early with such visits, when it comes time to apply for schools, then it won’t be as big of a deal to go and visit one or two schools, including the “official” tour, to help decide.

But tell me: what choice do people have? everyone can't be an \"A\" student with a huge full-ride scholarship to an Ivy League school. What happens to the rest of us and our kids? Where do WE go to college? or do we go at all? And if we can't afford to run up these kinds of debts -- when even state schools cost $20K a year (more with room &amp; board) -- what happens to us in a high tech economy, when we have no college degree?  Funny, all through this election season, I read thousands of posts mocking Trump voters as \"stupid, low information, NOT COLLEGE EDUCATED\" -- yet is it really a surprise that people who have little money or savings, would be hesitant to go into six figure debt to get a degree that has a high likelihood of NOT panning out into a good paying career, but just a series of part-time low paying \"gigs\" or temp jobs? and leave them and their parents deeply in NON-DISCHARGEABLE debt?\n",

No one who graduates from high school should fail to see the folly of borrowing 150,000 to possibly become a photographer--or even $15,000. The real question that one must ask: How can millions of high school graduates remain so clueless about financial realities of debt? How can millions of high school graduates so easily sign away large chunks of their (hoped for) monthly income for periods extending to 10 (or far more) years?  The USA government and the school/college industrial complex has falsely indoctrinated children that \"schooling\" leads to success. As student loans have become ridiculously easy to obtain (just like with cars and houses and credit cards), an indoctrinated and dumbed down youth has drunk the Kool Aid. The school/college industrial complex lies at the root of this nation-wide travesty. It is their greed and corruption that has contributed to this unconscionable level of debt. Even so, the doctrine of fraud has always imposed a reasonable due diligence requirement on those who are intended victims. Today, that doctrine has become so relaxed that anyone can deny their own personal responsibility.\n",

Like buying a stock, there is no promise of gains and the financial advisers clearly state that.    You are a HS teacher and tell the kids this, but they ignore you anyway.  I found the same when talking with kids that signed for 2 mortgages on a house they clearly couldn't afford in the mid-2000s.  But, they did it anyway 'cause they wanted to.  When do we make individuals responsible?    Slick ads are only likely to grow with the internet and social media.

      "\tcomment=\"Let him that stole steal no more but work with his hands, working the thing that is good . . . . . . .\"  Thus the Apostle Paul.  In his Epistle to the Ephesians.  This verse (I have long believed) should be a guiding light to people in the business community.  Among others.  At the end of the day, can you honestly say, \"Today I did something worthwhile.  I benefited someone.  I did someone good service.  I justified (as it were) my existence on this planet.\"  If not--ask yourself what it is you're doing wrong.  Then fix it.  I know a man (now retired) who for most of his life was a stockbroker.  He did well.  He and his wife are both pretty comfortably fixed.   We were questioning him once about his Wall Street career.  \"Wall Street,\" someone said.  \"It's all about GREED--right?\"   David considered this a moment.  \"No,\" he said finally, \"Greed and FEAR.\"   So what was David all about?  What kept HIM going?  \"I had only one goal,\" he told us.  \"It was--do the best job I possibly could to benefit my client.  First and foremost, I considered HIS interests.  Or HER interests.  And that was it.  The job I had--do it as well as I could.\"      Hey you guys at Wells Fargo!  You head honchos--now reviled and detested--POORER (by some millions of dollars)--SQUIRMING under the baleful eye of Uncle Sam.  Next time, talk to my friend David.  Listen to him.  Sit up and pay attention.  Or read Ephesians.  You could do worse.  Much worse. \n",
