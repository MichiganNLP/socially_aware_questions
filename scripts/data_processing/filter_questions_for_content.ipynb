      "['Disrespect for the rule of law has been encouraged by Fox News for years now.  The result is apparent in several of the comments posted here.  <br/><br/>In a death\\'s-door interview with Melvyn Bragg some twenty-four years ago, Dennis Potter, the great British television dramatist, said, while sipping from a flask of liquid morphine to soothe the pain of pancreatic cancer, that if there was one person he\\'d like to kill before he died, it would Rupert Murdoch.  He said that Murdoch had done more to pollute civic discourse in Britain than any other person and that British media and society in general had suffered immeasurably as the result of his depredations.  This was shortly before Murdoch jumped the pond and began to befoul the United States with his lucrative brand of nativist nonsense.  <br/><br/>But it\\'s worse than nonsense.  Fox\\'s hate-mongering is extremely dangerous.  What Murdoch and Ailes have wrought is anathema to the democratic experiment that is America.  You think I\\'m being hyperbolic?  Talk to the guy who shot up the pizza parlor in D. C.  There is nothing Fox News won\\'t do to get and keep eyeballs.  This includes fomenting insurrection on the part of the ignorant that cling to the notion that they and they alone are the True America.  <br/><br/>You cannot, by law, yell \"Fire\" in a crowded theater when there is none.  Murdoch, that insidious opportunist, should not be allowed to ply the trash that he does.  A man\\'s judgment is only as good as the information upon which it is based.   '\n",

Are we now being punished for the horrible wrongs our government has done during the first 200 years of our history? (Think slavery, the treatment of Native Americans, more recently Vietnam, Iraq) <br/><br/>Trump has cried \"Disgraceful\" and he is right. His behavior before his election was indeed DISGRACEFUL. His behavior after the election has been much worse. No longer is his behavior just \"tabloid fodder\". As the American president his behavior has been treasonous. Yes, treasonous for the way he has destroyed the moral leadership of America in the eyes of a majority of Americans as well as most of the world. May his reputation persist for future generations as the worst human to have ever entered the Oval Office. '\n",
      " 'President Trump’s lawyers office contained thousands of protected client secrets unrelated to any payment for non-disclosure or even the president. Law enforcement now has access to all those unrelated attorney-client documents. <br/><br/>Search warrant or not, it is an affront to the 6th Amendment. Why not simply issue a grand jury subpoena compelling Cohen to produce the documents and make it a crime of obstruction to destroy them? A lawyers office is not above the law, but it is one of the few places protected by the constitution, just like a newspaper office. As liberals glory in this attack on the Bill of Rights, remember the slippery slope we have started down.'\n",
      " 'trump never did release his tax returns. If there is nothing to hide, why wouldn\\'t trump come clean and show the US public his tax returns for the sake of public trust? If you are hiding one thing, you are likely hiding others.<br/><br/>As a private real estate developer, trump was bound by the rules of law regarding fair housing, building codes, etc. If he wanted to conduct business adhering to the letter of the law and not the spirit of the law resulting in a constant stream of lawsuits, that was his private business. But to transfer such a mentality to the office of POTUS smacks of the highest level of personal arrogance I can imagine - the United States should be governed with the highest standard of integrity, not like some sleazy company where contractors are not paid, high rise buildings don\\'t have sprinklers above a certain floor because \"the law\" doesn\\'t require them, etc. <br/><br/>All this stuff is unfortunately related to a president who is in it for himself and his personal enrichment, not for the Citizens of the US. I mean, just continually calling out any negative reporting \"fake news\" by the \"dishonest media\" is in itself against the interest of being accountable to the public he is supposedly there to serve...<br/><br/>Attacking the character of Robert Mueller, a patriotic hero is the last straw...'\n",
      " 'Not to mention how sweet Cohen was to contact Donald Shields in the Trump Tower, a 42nd floor resident, and told him to get out during the fire. <br/><br/>Aren’t they sweet?  Lobby against building sprinklers, pay off porn stars, pal with Russians, and so much more.<br/><br/>Go FBI.  Go Robert Mueller. '\n",
      " \"To all those complaining that Mueller has overstepped his bounds... let's suppose this is 2014 and Robert Mueller is investigating Barack Obama. Let's say in the course of his investigation he comes across evidence of a possible crime committed by one of Obama's associates.<br/><br/>Now let's say he does nothing with the information. Doesn't act on it himself, doesn't forward it to the US Attorney, just buries it. What do we suppose the Republican response would be to this?<br/><br/>Here's the inconvenient truth (inconvenient mostly because a judge was convinced there was enough evidence to justify a search warrant): ANYTHING Robert Mueller comes across that is evidence of a possible crime he absolutely MUST act upon, whether it has anything to do with the scope of his Russia investigation or not. If the evidence is directly related to his investigation, he acts on it himself. If it's related to possible criminal activity outside his jurisdiction, he refers the matter to the appropriate authorities.<br/><br/>This is not some arbitrary decision he makes, and it is never him overstepping... it is required by the law. Imagine the uproar from the White House if Robert Mueller were to discover that Hillary Clinton used her private email server in a criminal fashion when she was Secretary of State, but decided not to say anything because it didn't have anything to do with the Russia investigation?<br/><br/>Think they'd be complaining that he wasn't doing his job?\"\n",
      " 'Very scary, though hardly surprising, that Trump called this an \"attack on our country in the true sense.\"  No, it is an attack on a lawyer, a lawyer who sometimes represents private citizen Trump, and not in any way an attack on our country.<br/><br/>The White House, not surprisingly, tried to clarify Trump\\'s remark saying he was referring to the sanctity of client-attorney privilege.  But both Trump and Cohen agree that the payment was made by Cohen and the agreement written by Cohen without Trump\\'s knowledge, so Cohen can not be said to have been acting as Trump\\'s attorney.  Unless, as most people assume, Trump and Cohen are both lying.<br/><br/>And for everyone saying this is overreach by Muller, what is he supposed to do when he sees evidence of possible crimes?  Does Trump and his team get a free pass, only those crimes committed that directly involve collusion with Russia get investigated, evidence of other possible criminal activity discovered along the way is swept under the rug? Trump and Cohen haven\\'t been indicted, much less convicted, for anything so let\\'s give the prosecutors a chance to do their job.  '\n",
      " '\"The searches open a new front for the Justice Department in its scrutiny of Mr. Trump and his associates: His longtime lawyer is being investigated in Manhattan; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is facing scrutiny by prosecutors in Brooklyn; his former campaign chairman is under indictment; his former national security adviser has pleaded guilty to lying; and a pair of former campaign aides are cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\"<br/><br/>All this and Mr Trump (sorry can\\'t bring myself to call him President) claims that  Washington that is a swamp.  It that is true, then Trump and company are a step beyond that - dare I say \"Cesspool\"?'\n",
      " 'Perhaps Team Mueller and the US Attorney for the Southern District were fearful that Cohen was about to engage BleachBit to wipe his servers and hard drives, or on the verge of taking a hammer to his cell phones, or both. <br/><br/>What would have been the reaction in Progressive Land had the Bureau raided the offices of David Kendall at Williams &amp; Connolly based on concerns about his role in the destruction of the 30,000 deleted emails?   <br/><br/>#NeutralPrinciples?'\n",
      " 'He is not a King. He is not above the law. It is not an attack on the nation. It is an investigation of a most unusual political campaign’s ties to a foreign power. <br/><br/>When his personal lawyer has admitted to being involved in paying hush money during the campaign, how is it surprising that investigators want to collect and preserve evidence? '\n",
      " '“an attack on our country in a true sense”<br/>If not concerned that he is directly threatened by the FBI raid on the office of his personal lawyer, why would Trump consider this move an attack on the country? '\n",
      " 'Any reasonable person would not be surprised by this turn of events if she/he were dumb enough to do what Michael D. Cohen had admittedly done.<br/>Trump is simply not accustomed to being held accountable for even extremely grievous actions.<br/>Why, for example, hasn’t a special prosecutor been appointed to investigate the multitude of claims of sexual abuse against Trump? As a billionaire, he’s protected, privileged, and above most laws.'\n",
      " \"When. It's just a matter of when the President will fire Mueller. I'd love to be wrong. But he has a largely spineless party (looking at you, Paul Ryan) that has let him run amok, the General can barely contain him anymore and he has now officially lost it. Seriously, he's an overindulged toddler. <br/><br/>Why wouldn't he?  \"\n",
      " \"I am amazed to see that there are people that feel this was overstepping.  If you were being investigated by the police and they found evidence of more illegal activity there than they were looking for, do you think they would just ignore the other criminal activity?  If a vice squad was looking for porn payments and found doctored tax returns, they would call in the IRS and financial forensic investigators.  The investigatee does not get to say, oh yeah you have a justifiable cause and a search warrant, but don't look under the bed.  <br/><br/>If there were nothing to hide, Trump wouldn't be acting so paranoid and scared.  Trump is like a wool sweater, pull on the dangling thread and what do you know, it all unravels.  This is an old story, but some people never learn. \"\n",

This is the same guy who defrauded average people by pretending to have a real estate \"university\" that offered nothing as advertised. \"Unfair\" from the guy who ridiculed every Republican candidate during the primaries because he could not debate the issues on their merits. <br/><br/>\"Unfair\" is the cry of the child, the schoolroom bully, who finally gets his nose bloodied after picking a fight with someone he was sure he could beat. He is so immature he hasn\\'t figured out yet that actions have consequences and he is responsible for his own. \"Unfair\" that life has failed to give him the golden pass that this golden boy expects from everyone no matter how egregious his own behavior. <br/><br/>No, Dumb Donnie, \"Unfair\" is what this country and the world are experiencing with him in office! Never forget that he got that office through unfair means. Sinclair and Fox and the National Enquirer all helped him with reporting featuring lies and distortions. The Republicans helped him with gerrymandering and voter suppression. The plutocrats helped him with unlimited campaign spending. The Russians helped him with social media bots and stolen emails. Was all of that \"fair\"? And Cohen helped him with threats and hush money for the women who spoke out about his sexual antics. <br/><br/>Life is not fair, but if we are very, very lucky it might be just. Keep digging Mr. Mueller. There is a ton of rot to be exposed and we need it to see it.'\n",

Is Mueller our Emanuel Goldstein? What if Mueller finds no collusion, no criminal activity relate to Trump?<br/><br/>As this soap opera plays out, as we\\'re fed bits of hope, yet Trump by executive orders is rolling back our protections and rights (civil and constitutional). His cabinet of DeVos\\'s, Carsons, Pruitts, Mnuchins etc etc are doing the same. Little by little, they are transferring our wealth to the pockets of their friends and cronies and turning us into a \"Third World Nation\".<br/><br/>In summary, it would appear that the U.S. government has been overthrown by a sophisticated organized crime group, with international connections to Asia. <br/><br/>In retrospect, The initial steps of this Coup were put into place a generation ago. We should have had the alarms go off in our heads during Obama\\'s administration when the congress refused to hold hearings on Judge Garland.<br/>Is it too late? I really don\\'t know, but I have no reason to be optimistic at this point.'\n",
