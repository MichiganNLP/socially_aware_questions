IMPERIAL BARBER PRODUCTS set out to evolve the craft of American mens grooming by bringing time-honored grooming traditions into the home via all-natural, utilitarian, premium products. Founded in 2009 by Master Barbers Scott Serrata and Pedro Zermeno, Imperial Barber Products set out to evolve the craft of American mens grooming by bringing time-honored grooming traditions into the home via all-natural, utilitarian, premium products. Today, Imperial Barber Products has become an authority in masculine mens grooming. The team behind Imperial Barber Products have spent a combined 30 years in the Los Angeles, London and New York City barber culture. During that time, they worked to perfect the craft of classic American mens styling. In all those years they never found a hair or grooming product that worked perfectly. Pomades, gels and waxes were too weak, too greasy and waxy, or too fragrant, while shaving products often fell victim to an onslaught of hype that never met expectations. The Imperial team decided to work together to build the perfect products themselves. Purveyors of timeless products rooted in traditional mens grooming, the Imperial team embraces and supports classic American styling. Each product is custom formulated and crafted with performance, utility and function in mind. All products adhere to the same guidelines: Made by barbers. Made to work.
