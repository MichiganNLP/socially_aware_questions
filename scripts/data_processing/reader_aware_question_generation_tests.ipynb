      "source text =  federal  judge  in  Manhattan  indicated  on  Monday  that  she  was  not  prepared  to  grant  President  Trump  exclusive  first  access  to  documents  seized  in  F .  B .  I .  raids  on  the  office  of  his  personal  lawyer ,  and  said  that  she  was  considering  appointing  an  independent  lawyer  to  assist  in  reviewing  the  seized  materials .  Feeling  her  way  toward  a  resolution  of  the  high - stakes  clash  involving  Mr .  Trump  and  the  federal  prosecutors  investigating  the  lawyer ,  Michael  D .  Cohen ,  the  judge ,  Kim ba  M .  Wood ,  did  not  grant  Mr .  Trump 's  request  to  review  the  trove  of  materials  ahead  of  prosecutors .  But  she  also  decided  that  prosecutors  would  not  immediately  have  access  to  the  materials  and  that  Mr .  Trump  would  ultimately  receive  copies  of  the  documents  that  per tain  to  him .  The  courtroom  battle  over  what  to  do  with  the  seized  material  came  one  week  after  federal  agents ,  in  an  extraordinary  move ,  descended  on  Mr .  Cohen 's  properties  and  walked  away  with  10  boxes  of  documents  and  as  many  as  a  dozen  electronic  devices ,  including  cell phones  and  computer  hard  drives .  Lawyers  for  Mr .  Trump  and  Mr .  Cohen ,  and  prosecutors  with  the  United  States  attorney 's  office  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York ,  had  asked  Judge  Wood  for  the  right  to  look  at  the  documents  in  order  to  determine  which  among  them  might  be  protected  by  attorney - client  privilege .  That  step  is  important  because  it  could  affect  which  documents  prosecutors  can  ultimately  use  in  the  investigation .  In  the  aftermath  of  the  raid ,  people  in  the  Trump  administration  said  they  saw  the  Cohen  inquiry  as  a  more  serious  threat  to  Mr .  Trump  than  the  investigation  by  the  special  counsel ,  Robert  S .  Mueller  III .  While  Judge  Wood  did  not  formally  rule  on  which  side  should  get  the  initial  look  and  said  that  discussions  would  continue ,  she  added  that  she  trusted  the  prosecutors .\"  I  have  faith  in  the  Southern  District  U .  S .  attorney 's  office  that  their  integrity  is  unim pe achable ,\"  Judge  Wood  said .  From  the  moment  he  entered  the  White  House ,  Mr .  Trump  has  had  his  share  of  trouble  with  federal  courts  around  the  country ,  where  judges  have  ruled  against  him  on  policy  issues  like  immigration  and  transgender  soldiers ,  as  well  as  on  possible  conflicts  of  interest  involving  his  businesses .  But  the  matter  before  Judge  Wood  touched  on  a  much  more  intimate  issue  for  the  president ,  involving  one  of  his  closest  relationships  and  potentially  in ching  him  closer  to  personal  legal  jeopardy .  Mr .  Cohen  served  for  more  than  a  decade  as  a  trusted  fix er  for  Mr .  Trump ,  and  during  the  campaign  had  helped  tamp  down  brewing  scandals  about  women  who  claimed  to  have  had  affairs  with  him .  Mr .  Cohen ,  who  had  not  appeared  at  an  initial  hearing  in  the  matter  on  Friday ,  showed  up  on  Monday  at  the  direction  of  the  judge .  After  greeting  a  g agg le  of  reporters  seated  in  the  jury  box ,  he  sat  quietly  between  his  lawyers  at  the  table  usually  reserved  for  defendants ,  saying  nothing  during  the  hearing .  The  seized  documents  could  shed  light  on  the  president 's  relationship  with  a  lawyer  who  has  helped  navigate  some  of  Mr .  Trump 's  thorn iest  personal  and  business  problems .  One  of  those  problems  involved  Stephanie  Clifford ,  a  pornographic  film  star  better  known  as  Storm y  Daniels ,  who  has  claimed  to  have  had  an  affair  with  Mr .  Trump  and  has  accused  Mr .  Cohen  of  paying  her  $  130 ,  000  to  keep  silent .  Moments  before  the  hearing  began ,  Ms .  Clifford  swept  into  the  courtroom  with  her  lawyer ,  Michael  Aven atti ,  and  took  a  seat  in  a  folding  chair  against  one  wall .  Mr .  Cohen  and  Ms .  Clifford  have  been  spar ring  for  weeks  in  the  media ,  but  confronting  one  another  for  the  first  time  in  court ,  they  did  not  appear  to  share  so  much  as  a  glance .  The  two - and - a - half - hour  hearing  was  also  notable  for  the  surprise  revelation  that  Sean  Hannity ,  the  Fox  News  host  and  one  of  Mr .  Trump 's  most  ardent  supporters ,  had  secretly  been  a  client  of  Mr .  Cohen .  In  court  papers  filed  before  the  hearing ,  Mr .  Cohen 's  lawyers  had  said  that  he  had  represented  three  clients  on  legal  matters  in  the  last  few  years .  Two  of  them ,  the  lawyers  said ,  were  Mr .  Trump  and  a  Republican  donor ,  Elliott  Bro idy ,  who  recently  resigned  from  his  position  at  the  Republican  National  Committee  after  reports  emerged  that  Mr .  Cohen  had  helped  him  arrange  a  $  1 .  6  million  payment  to  a  former  Playboy  model  who  became  pregnant  during  an  affair .  The  lawyers  refused  to  name  the  third  client ,  suggesting  he  did  not  want  to  be  associated  with  Mr .  Cohen  at  this  point  --  until ,  that  is ,  Judge  Wood  forced  them  to  identify  him  as  Mr .  Hannity .  The  government  had  asked  that  it  be  able  to  use  a  special  group  of  prosecutors  not  involved  in  the  investigation  --  known  as  a \"  t aint  team \"  --  to  review  the  seized  materials  and  determine  whether  any  seemed  to  violate  the  attorney - client  privilege .  During  the  hearing ,  Judge  Wood ,  after  saying  that  she  considered  a  t aint  team \"  a  viable  option ,\"  also  explained  why  she  was  considering  appointing  an  independent  lawyer ,  known  as  a  special  master ,  to  assist  in  the  review .\"  In  terms  of  perception  of  fairness ,\"  she  said ,\"  not  fairness  itself ,  but  perception  of  fairness ,  a  special  master  might  have  a  role  here .

      "source text =  federal  judge  in  Manhattan  indicated  on  Monday  that  she  was  not  prepared  to  grant  President  Trump  exclusive  first  access  to  documents  seized  in  F .  B .  I .  raids  on  the  office  of  his  personal  lawyer ,  and  said  that  she  was  considering  appointing  an  independent  lawyer  to  assist  in  reviewing  the  seized  materials .  Feeling  her  way  toward  a  resolution  of  the  high - stakes  clash  involving  Mr .  Trump  and  the  federal  prosecutors  investigating  the  lawyer ,  Michael  D .  Cohen ,  the  judge ,  Kim ba  M .  Wood ,  did  not  grant  Mr .  Trump 's  request  to  review  the  trove  of  materials  ahead  of  prosecutors .  But  she  also  decided  that  prosecutors  would  not  immediately  have  access  to  the  materials  and  that  Mr .  Trump  would  ultimately  receive  copies  of  the  documents  that  per tain  to  him .  The  courtroom  battle  over  what  to  do  with  the  seized  material  came  one  week  after  federal  agents ,  in  an  extraordinary  move ,  descended  on  Mr .  Cohen 's  properties  and  walked  away  with  10  boxes  of  documents  and  as  many  as  a  dozen  electronic  devices ,  including  cell phones  and  computer  hard  drives .  Lawyers  for  Mr .  Trump  and  Mr .  Cohen ,  and  prosecutors  with  the  United  States  attorney 's  office  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York ,  had  asked  Judge  Wood  for  the  right  to  look  at  the  documents  in  order  to  determine  which  among  them  might  be  protected  by  attorney - client  privilege .  That  step  is  important  because  it  could  affect  which  documents  prosecutors  can  ultimately  use  in  the  investigation .  In  the  aftermath  of  the  raid ,  people  in  the  Trump  administration  said  they  saw  the  Cohen  inquiry  as  a  more  serious  threat  to  Mr .  Trump  than  the  investigation  by  the  special  counsel ,  Robert  S .  Mueller  III .  While  Judge  Wood  did  not  formally  rule  on  which  side  should  get  the  initial  look  and  said  that  discussions  would  continue ,  she  added  that  she  trusted  the  prosecutors .\"  I  have  faith  in  the  Southern  District  U .  S .  attorney 's  office  that  their  integrity  is  unim pe achable ,\"  Judge  Wood  said .  From  the  moment  he  entered  the  White  House ,  Mr .  Trump  has  had  his  share  of  trouble  with  federal  courts  around  the  country ,  where  judges  have  ruled  against  him  on  policy  issues  like  immigration  and  transgender  soldiers ,  as  well  as  on  possible  conflicts  of  interest  involving  his  businesses .  But  the  matter  before  Judge  Wood  touched  on  a  much  more  intimate  issue  for  the  president ,  involving  one  of  his  closest  relationships  and  potentially  in ching  him  closer  to  personal  legal  jeopardy .  Mr .  Cohen  served  for  more  than  a  decade  as  a  trusted  fix er  for  Mr .  Trump ,  and  during  the  campaign  had  helped  tamp  down  brewing  scandals  about  women  who  claimed  to  have  had  affairs  with  him .  Mr .  Cohen ,  who  had  not  appeared  at  an  initial  hearing  in  the  matter  on  Friday ,  showed  up  on  Monday  at  the  direction  of  the  judge .  After  greeting  a  g agg le  of  reporters  seated  in  the  jury  box ,  he  sat  quietly  between  his  lawyers  at  the  table  usually  reserved  for  defendants ,  saying  nothing  during  the  hearing .  The  seized  documents  could  shed  light  on  the  president 's  relationship  with  a  lawyer  who  has  helped  navigate  some  of  Mr .  Trump 's  thorn iest  personal  and  business  problems .  One  of  those  problems  involved  Stephanie  Clifford ,  a  pornographic  film  star  better  known  as  Storm y  Daniels ,  who  has  claimed  to  have  had  an  affair  with  Mr .  Trump  and  has  accused  Mr .  Cohen  of  paying  her  $  130 ,  000  to  keep  silent .  Moments  before  the  hearing  began ,  Ms .  Clifford  swept  into  the  courtroom  with  her  lawyer ,  Michael  Aven atti ,  and  took  a  seat  in  a  folding  chair  against  one  wall .  Mr .  Cohen  and  Ms .  Clifford  have  been  spar ring  for  weeks  in  the  media ,  but  confronting  one  another  for  the  first  time  in  court ,  they  did  not  appear  to  share  so  much  as  a  glance .  The  two - and - a - half - hour  hearing  was  also  notable  for  the  surprise  revelation  that  Sean  Hannity ,  the  Fox  News  host  and  one  of  Mr .  Trump 's  most  ardent  supporters ,  had  secretly  been  a  client  of  Mr .  Cohen .  In  court  papers  filed  before  the  hearing ,  Mr .  Cohen 's  lawyers  had  said  that  he  had  represented  three  clients  on  legal  matters  in  the  last  few  years .  Two  of  them ,  the  lawyers  said ,  were  Mr .

[  Read  our  February  2018  profile  of  Michael  D .  Cohen  ]  To  obtain  a  search  warrant ,  prosecutors  must  convince  a  federal  judge  that  agents  are  likely  to  discover  evidence  of  criminal  activity .  The  searches  are  a  significant  intrusion  by  prosecutors  into  the  dealings  of  one  of  Mr .  Trump 's  closest  confid ants ,  and  they  pose  a  dilemma  for  Mr .  Trump .  He  has  dismissed  Mr .  Mueller 's  investigation  as  a \"  witch  hunt ,\"  but  these  warrants  were  obtained  by  an  unrelated  group  of  prosecutors .  The  searches  required  prior  consultation  with  senior  members  of  Mr .  Trump 's  own  Justice  Department .  Mr .  Trump  and  Mr .  Cohen ,  however ,  regarded  the  searches  as  an  effort  by  Mr .  Mueller  to  use  New  York 's  prosecutors  as  his  proxy ,  according  to  two  people  close  to  the  men .  The  searches  open  a  new  front  for  the  Justice  Department  in  its  scrutiny  of  Mr .  Trump  and  his  associates  :  His  longtime  lawyer  is  being  investigated  in  Manhattan  ;  his  son - in - law ,  Jared  Kushner ,  is  facing  scrutiny  by  prosecutors  in  Brooklyn  ;  his  former  campaign  chairman  is  under  indictment  ;  his  former  national  security  adviser  has  pleaded  guilty  to  lying  ;  and  a  pair  of  former  campaign  aides  are  cooperating  with  Mr .  Mueller .  Mr .  Mueller ,  meanwhile ,  wants  to  interview  Mr .  Trump  about  possible  obstruction  of  justice .  It  is  not  clear  what  Mr .

      "source text =  De ason  stumbled  upon  the  psychological  questionnaire  on  June  9 ,  2014 .  He  was  taking  a  lot  of  online  surveys  back  then ,  each  one  earning  him  a  few  dollars  to  help  pay  the  bills .  Nothing  about  this  one ,  which  he  saw  on  an  online  job  platform ,  struck  him  as \"  creepy  or  weird ,\"  he  said  later .  So  at  6  :  37  that  evening ,  Mr .  De ason  completed  the  first  step  of  the  survey  :  He  granted  access  to  his  Facebook  account .  Less  than  a  second  later ,  a  Facebook  app  had  harvested  not  only  Mr .  De ason 's  profile  data ,  but  also  data  from  the  profiles  of  205  of  his  Facebook  friends .  Their  names ,  birth  dates  and  location  data ,  as  well  as  lists  of  every  Facebook  page  they  had  ever  liked ,  were  downloaded  --  without  their  knowledge  or  express  consent  --  before  Mr .  De ason  could  even  begin  reading  the  first  survey  question .  The  information  was  added  to  a  huge  database  being  compiled  for  Cambridge  Analy t ica ,  the  political  data  firm  with  links  to  Donald  J .  Trump 's  2016  presidential  campaign .  None  of  the  people  whose  data  was  collected  knew  it  had  happened ,  not  even  Mr .  De ason .\"  I  don 't  think  I  would  have  gone  forward  with  it  if  I  had ,\"  Mr .  De ason ,  27 ,  said  in  a  recent  interview .  Mr .  De ason  and  his  Facebook  friends  became  early  entries  in  a  database  that  would  ultimately  encompass  tens  of  millions  of  Facebook  profiles  and  is  now  at  the  center  of  a  crisis  facing  the  social  media  giant .  News  of  Cambridge  Analy t ica 's  data  collection ,  first  reported  last  month  by  The  New  York  Times  and  The  Observer  of  London ,  has  spurred  a  #  Delete Facebook  movement  and  brought  the  social  network  under  intens ifying  scrutiny  from  lawmakers  and  regulators  in  the  United  States  and  Britain .  Still ,  few  of  the  roughly  214  million  Americans  with  Facebook  profiles  know  whether  their  data  was  among  the  information  swept  up  for  Cambridge  Analy t ica .  Facebook ,  which  learned  of  the  data  misuse  in  December  2015 ,  plans  to  begin  telling  affected  users  on  Monday ,  a  day  before  its  founder ,  Mark  Zuckerberg ,  is  to  testify  before  Congress .  Records  reviewed  by  The  Times  show  that  roughly  300 ,  000  people  took  the  survey ,  but  because  of  the  access  to  friends ' information  allowed  at  the  time ,  Facebook  said  that  as  many  as  87  million  users  could  have  been  affected .  But  The  Times ,  which  has  viewed  a  set  of  raw  data  from  the  profiles  that  Cambridge  Analy t ica  paid  an  academic  researcher  to  obtain ,  contacted  nearly  two  dozen  affected  Facebook  users  in  recent  weeks .  Some  were  angry  --  one  woman  compared  it  to  being  robbed  --  while  others  were  annoyed  but  unsur pr ised ,  having  grown  cynical  about  tech  giants ' use  of  the  data  they  collect .  They  are  some  of  the  first  known  affected  Facebook  users  to  be  publicly  identified .  And  nearly  all  said  the  misuse  of  their  data  had  given  them  second  thoughts  about  staying  on  Facebook .\"  I 've  come  to  grips  with  the  fact  that  you  are  the  product  on  the  internet ,\"  said  Mark  Snyder ,  32 ,  who  lives  in  P omp ano  Beach ,  Fla .,  and  was  among  Mr .  De ason 's  friends  whose  data  was  collected .\"  If  you  sign  up  for  anything  and  it  isn 't  immediately  obvious  how  they 're  making  money ,  they 're  making  money  off  of  you ,\"  said  Mr .  Snyder ,  who  maintains  computer  networks  for  a  living .  Mr .  Zuckerberg  has  said  the  misuse  of  data  represented  a \"  breach  of  trust \"  by  the  company .  But  even  he  has  suggested  that  other  app  developers  could  have  done  the  same .  Until  April  2015 ,  Facebook  allowed  some  app  developers  to  collect  some  private  information  from  the  profiles  of  users  who  downloaded  apps ,  and  from  those  of  their  friends .  Facebook  has  said  it  allowed  this  kind  of  data  collection  to  help  developers  improve  the \"  in - app \"  experience  for  users .  But  Facebook  appears  to  have  done  little  to  verify  how  developers  were  using  the  data  or  whether  they  were  providing  any  kind  of  experience  on  Facebook  at  all .  The  questionnaire  used  to  collect  data  for  Cambridge  Analy t ica  was  not  actually  on  Facebook .  It  was  hosted  by  a  company  called  Qual tr ics ,  which  provides  a  platform  for  online  surveys .  It  consisted  of  dozens  of  questions  often  used  by  psychology  researchers  to  assess  personality ,  such  as  whether  the  respondent  prefers  to  be  alone ,  tries  to  lead  others  and  loves  large  parties  ( the  answer  choices  range  from \"  disagree  strongly \"  to \"  agree  strongly \").  The  questionnaire  took  about  10  to  20  minutes  to  complete .  When  respondents  authorized  access  to  their  Facebook  profiles ,  the  app  performed  its  sole  function  :  to  take  the  users 'd ata  and  that  of  their  friends .  There  was  no \"  in - app \"  experience  to  speak  of  ;  this  was  not  intended  to  be  the  sort  of  cute  online  quiz  that  tells  users  which \"  Friends \"  character  they  most  resemble  or  how  their  brunch  preferences  reveal  their  inner  Disney  princess .  Facebook  has  said  that  people  who  took  the  quiz  were  told  that  their  data  would  be  used  only  for  academic  purposes ,  claiming  that  it  and  its  users  were  misled  by  Cambridge  Analy t ica  and  the  researcher  it  hired ,  Ale ks andr  K ogan ,  a  28 - year - old  Russian - American  academic .  But  the  fine  print  that  accompanied  the  questionnaire  may  have  told  users  that  their  data  could  be  used  for  commercial  purposes ,  according  to  a  draft  of  the  survey 's  terms  of <US_AUTHOR>...\n",

Still ,  few  of  the  roughly  214  million  Americans  with  Facebook  profiles  know  whether  their  data  was  among  the  information  swept  up  for  Cambridge  Analy t ica .  Facebook ,  which  learned  of  the  data  misuse  in  December  2015 ,  plans  to  begin  telling  affected  users  on  Monday ,  a  day  before  its  founder ,  Mark  Zuckerberg ,  is  to  testify  before  Congress .  Records  reviewed  by  The  Times  show  that  roughly  300 ,  000  people  took  the  survey ,  but  because  of  the  access  to  friends ' information  allowed  at  the  time ,  Facebook  said  that  as  many  as  87  million  users  could  have  been  affected .  But  The  Times ,  which  has  viewed  a  set  of  raw  data  from  the  profiles  that  Cambridge  Analy t ica  paid  an  academic  researcher  to  obtain ,  contacted  nearly  two  dozen  affected  Facebook  users  in  recent  weeks .  Some  were  angry  --  one  woman  compared  it  to  being  robbed  --  while  others  were  annoyed  but  unsur pr ised ,  having  grown  cynical  about  tech  giants ' use  of  the  data  they  collect .

But  even  he  has  suggested  that  other  app  developers  could  have  done  the  same .

But  Facebook  appears  to  have  done  little  to  verify  how  developers  were  using  the  data  or  whether  they  were  providing  any  kind  of  experience  on  Facebook  at  all .  The  questionnaire  used  to  collect  data  for  Cambridge  Analy t ica  was  not  actually  on  Facebook .  It  was  hosted  by  a  company  called  Qual tr ics ,  which  provides  a  platform  for  online  surveys .

The  questionnaire  took  about  10  to  20  minutes  to  complete .  When  respondents  authorized  access  to  their  Facebook  profiles ,  the  app  performed  its  sole  function  :  to  take  the  users 'd ata  and  that  of  their  friends .

Facebook  has  said  that  people  who  took  the  quiz  were  told  that  their  data  would  be  used  only  for  academic  purposes ,  claiming  that  it  and  its  users  were  misled  by  Cambridge  Analy t ica  and  the  researcher  it  hired ,  Ale ks andr  K ogan ,  a  28 - year - old  Russian - American  academic .

      "source text =  De ason  stumbled  upon  the  psychological  questionnaire  on  June  9 ,  2014 .  He  was  taking  a  lot  of  online  surveys  back  then ,  each  one  earning  him  a  few  dollars  to  help  pay  the  bills .  Nothing  about  this  one ,  which  he  saw  on  an  online  job  platform ,  struck  him  as \"  creepy  or  weird ,\"  he  said  later .  So  at  6  :  37  that  evening ,  Mr .  De ason  completed  the  first  step  of  the  survey  :  He  granted  access  to  his  Facebook  account .  Less  than  a  second  later ,  a  Facebook  app  had  harvested  not  only  Mr .  De ason 's  profile  data ,  but  also  data  from  the  profiles  of  205  of  his  Facebook  friends .  Their  names ,  birth  dates  and  location  data ,  as  well  as  lists  of  every  Facebook  page  they  had  ever  liked ,  were  downloaded  --  without  their  knowledge  or  express  consent  --  before  Mr .  De ason  could  even  begin  reading  the  first  survey  question .  The  information  was  added  to  a  huge  database  being  compiled  for  Cambridge  Analy t ica ,  the  political  data  firm  with  links  to  Donald  J .  Trump 's  2016  presidential  campaign .  None  of  the  people  whose  data  was  collected  knew  it  had  happened ,  not  even  Mr .  De ason .\"  I  don 't  think  I  would  have  gone  forward  with  it  if  I  had ,\"  Mr .  De ason ,  27 ,  said  in  a  recent  interview .  Mr .

Trump  said  in  a  statement  that  he  was  responding  to \"  unfair  retaliation \"  by  China ,  which  published  a  list  on  Wednesday  of  $  50  billion  in  American  products  that  would  be  hit  by  tariffs ,  including  soy beans  and  pork .  That  move  was  a  direct  reaction  to  the  $  50  billion  in  tariffs  on  Chinese  goods  that  the  White  House  detailed  on  Tuesday .\"  Rather  than  remedy  its  misconduct ,  China  has  chosen  to  harm  our  farmers  and  manufacturers ,\"  Mr .  Trump  said ,  adding  that  he  has  instructed  the  United  States  trade  representative  to  determine  if  another  $  100  billion  in  tariffs  were  warranted  and ,\"  if  so ,  to  identify  the  products  upon  which  to  impose  such  tariffs .\"  The  announcement  came  one  day  after  some  of  Mr .  Trump 's  advisers  tried  to  calm  markets  and  tamp  down  fears  of  a  trade  war  between  the  world 's  two  largest  economies ,  saying  that  the  tariff  threats  were  the  first  step  in  a  negotiation  process .  Mr .  Trump  said  in  his  statement  that  the  potential  for  new  tariffs  would  not  preclude  discussions  with  the  Chinese \"  to  protect  the  technology  and  intellectual  property  of  American  companies  and  American  people ,\"  but  any  new  tariffs  are  unlikely  to  make  that  already  tough  task  easier .  The  move  is  a  high - stakes  gamble  aimed  at  c owing  China  into  backing  down  and  forcing  it  to  make  the  kinds  of  changes  that  the  United  States  is  seeking  --  namely  reducing  the  coercive  tactics  American  officials  say  Beijing  uses  to  try  to  dominate  leading - edge  industries  like  artificial  intelligence ,  robotics  and  autonomous  vehicles .  But  the  move  could  ultimately  bring  about  the  kind  of  retaliation  from  Beijing  that  has  sp ooked  stock  markets .  It  also  means  that  the  United  States  would  be  somewhat  more  likely  to  place  lev ies  on  Chinese  products  that  American  households  routinely  purchase ,  like  furniture ,  clothing  or  shoes  --  an  outcome  the  Trump  administration  said  it  sought  to  avoid  with  its  initial  round  of  tariffs .  The  president 's  announcement  was  immediately  criticized  by  manufacturers ,  retailers  and  politicians  from  states  whose  economies  depend  on  agriculture .  Senator  Ben  S asse ,  Republican  of  Nebraska ,  said  Mr .  Trump  was \"  threatening  to  light  American  agriculture  on  fire .\"\"  Hopefully  the  president  is  just  blowing  off  steam  again ,  but  if  he 's  even  half - serious ,  this  is  nuts ,\"  Mr .  S asse  said .\"  Let 's  absolutely  take  on  Chinese  bad  behavior ,  but  with  a  plan  that  pun ishes  them  instead  of  us .  This  is  the  dumb est  possible  way  to  do  this .\"  A  trade  war  could  derail  the  current  global  economic  expansion  and  cripp le  American  businesses  that  depend  on  business  with  China .  It  could  also  further  complicate  geopolitical  priorities  given  the  Trump  administration  has  enlisted  the  help  of  the  Chinese  in  scheduling  historic  talks  with  North  Korea  next  month .  In  a  statement ,  Robert  L ighth izer ,  the  trade  adviser  who  is  carrying  out  an  investigation  into  Chinese  practices ,  described  the  president 's  threat  as \"  an  appropriate  response ,\"  saying  China  should  have  responded  to  the  initial  tariffs  levied  by  the  United  States  by  changing  its  behavior .  In  the  first  hint  of  the  Chinese  government 's  response  to  Mr .  Trump 's  latest  action ,  the  We ibo  min ib log  of  the  official  Xin hua  news  service  said  that \"  this  move  severely  violates  world  trade  regulations .\"  Zhu  Guang ya o ,  China 's  vice  minister  of  finance ,  made  clear  at  a  news  conference  on  Wednesday  afternoon  that  his  country  would  not  back  down  easily .\"  If  anyone  wants  to  fight ,  we 'll  be  there  with  them .  If  he  wants  to  negotiate ,  the  door  is  open ,\"  Mr .  Zhu  said .  Mr .  Trump 's  effort  to  raise  the  stakes  on  Thursday  seemed  poised  to  send  financial  markets  spinning ,  with  futures  on  the  Standard  &  Poor 's  500 - index  down  and  the  yen  climbing  against  the  dollar .  Companies  potentially  caught  in  the  middle  of  a  trade  war  called  on  the  Trump  administration  to  back  down  and  try  to  work  with  the  Chinese .\"  The  announcement  that  the  administration  may  issue  $  100  billion  in  additional  tariffs  on  Chinese  products  is  irresponsible  and  destabil izing ,\"  said  Dean  C .  Garfield ,  the  chief  executive  of  the  Information  Technology  Industry  Council ,  which  represents  companies  such  as  Amazon ,  Apple  and  IBM .\"  We  call  on  both  sides  to  halt  un productive  and  escal atory  rhetoric ,  recognizing  that  these  words  and  actions  have  global  consequences .\"  China  experts  have  questioned  whether  Mr .  Trump 's  aggressive  negotiating  style  will  leave  Chinese  leaders  with  enough  political  room  to  make  concessions  to  the  Americans .  B owing  to  the  president 's  demands  could  be  seen  internally  as  weakness ,  and  the  changes  that  the  administration  wants  --  reducing  China 's  dominance  in  cutting - edge  manufacturing  and  technology  --  is  not  something  Beijing  is  likely  to  agree  to .  Wang  Sh ou wen ,  China 's  vice  minister  of  commerce ,  has  repeatedly  refused  to  discuss  cur bing  the  Made  in  China  2025  industrial  plan .  The  Trump  administration  contends  that  the  program  violates  international  trade  rules  that  prohibit  countries  from  using  subsidies  to  help  exp orters  and  discourage  imports .  Mr .  Wang  and  other  officials  deny  that  the  program  is  in  violation ,  but  have  provided  few  details  on  how  it  might  comply .  Including  this  most  recent  action ,  the  United  States  would  be  placing  tariffs  on  a  total  of  $  153  billion  of  Chinese  products .  The  threat  of  $  100  billion  in  tariffs  came  on  top  of  the  tariffs  on  $  3  billion  in  Chinese <COMMENT_LEN_1_AUTHOR>...\n",

      "source text =  Comey 's  book  is  titled \"  A  Higher  Loyal ty ,\"  but  it  sur rend ers  the  higher  ground ,  at  least  partly .  To  watch  him  promote  it  is  to  see  him  descend .  Not  to  President  Trump 's  level  --  that 's  a  long  way  down .  But  Comey  is  playing  Trump 's  game ,  on  Trump 's  terms .  And  in  that  sense ,  he  has  let  the  president  get  the  better  of  him .  Trump  has  sought ,  by  accident  and  by  design ,  to  define  leadership  downward  and  establish  new  norms  of  behavior  for  political  candidates  and  government  officials .  Everyone  is  out  for  himself  or  herself .  No  gam bit  is  too  t aw dry  and  no  accusation  too  speculative ,  not  if  the  television  cameras  approve .  The  only  thing  better  than  a  whole  lot  of  attention  is  a  whole  lot  more .  And  here  we  have  the  former  head  of  a  supposedly  sc rupulous ,  detached  federal  agency  reaching  for  Mafia  metaphors ,  indul ging  talk  of  the  so - called  pee  tape  and  taking  cosmetic  digs  at  the  president  in  the  service  of  a  book  tour  as  exhaustive  and  elaborate  as  they  come .  There 's  apparently  room  in  Comey 's  prim ness  for  a  measure  of  Michael  Wol ff .  His  demeanor  may  not  be  fiery  or  furious .  Talking  with  George  Stephan opoulos  for  an  hour long  ABC  News  special  on  Sunday  night ,  he  maintained  a  subdued ,  steady  voice  and  communicated  sadness  more  than  anything  else  over  Trump 's  conduct  in  the  White  House .  But  other  aspects  of  that  special  told  a  more  complicated  story .  For  starters ,  Comey  didn 't  just  agree  to  a  single ,  straightforward  sit - down  with  Stephan opoulos .  He  granted  a  level  of  access  akin  to  a  p aj ama  party .  Meet  the  wife .  Here  are  some  great  shots  of  the  kids .  And  here  are  the  long  fingers  of  Comey 's  normally  sized  hands  on  the  very  keyboard  that  he  used  to  type  the  memos  that  documented  his  interactions  with  Trump .  Comey  was  game  to  provide  footage  of  that  --  and  to  follow  up  with  interviews  on  Tuesday  on \"  Good  Morning  America \"  and  on  Wednesday  on \"  The  View ,\"  which  is  not  a  place  where  I  would  have  expected  to  see  a  former  F .  B .  I .  director  anytime  soon .  I  mention  hands  because  Comey  does .  That  was  one  of  the  first  bits  of  his  book  that  leaked  out  last  week .  Fl ashing  back  to  his  initial  up - close  encounter  with  Trump ,  he  recalls  how  orange  Trump 's  skin  looked ,  how  impro bably  his  hair  gl ist ened  and  how  inferior  his  hands  were .\"  Small er  than  mine ,\"  Comey  writes ,  but  not \"  unusually  so .\"  I  chalk ed  that  up  to  a  fleeting  passage  over played  by  the  media ,  and  I  was  heart ened  by  other  advance  material  from  the  book .  Comey ,  for  example ,  mentions  his  experience  in  two  administrations  before  Trump 's  and  has  jud icious  complaints  about  members  of  each .  He  thus  makes  clear  his  broad  frame  of  reference  and  ability  to  find  flaw  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle .  But  he  revis ited  Trump 's  physical  peculiar ities  with  Stephan opoulos  on  Sunday  night .  Didn 't  Comey  always  tell  us  that  he  was  better  than  this ?  He  could  have  set  the  record  straight  and  settled  any  scores  that  need  settling  without  a  tour  this  extended  or  details  this  cat ty .  His  choice  of  a  different  tack  suggests  some  unfl attering  motives  in  the  mix .  It  gives  Trump 's  allies  plenty  to  attack  him  with ,  and  it  has  go aded  Trump  --  predictably  --  into  his  most  infant ile  epit he ts .  There 's  obviously  no  contest  of  character  or  credibility  between  Comey  and  Trump .  I  believe  most  and  maybe  all  of  what  Comey  has  to  say ,  and  much  of  it  needs  saying ,  as  an  answer  to  the  president 's  lies  and  an  exposure  --  affirmation  might  be  the  better  word  --  of  who  and  what  Trump  is .  But  in  succ umbing  to  this  show bo ating  and  spite ,  hasn 't  Comey  joined  Trump  almost  as  much  as  he 's  def ying  him ?  Comey  says  that  he  means  to  shine  a  spotlight  on  what  leadership  should  and  shouldn 't  be ,  and  I  hope  that 's  the  long - term  takeaway  of  the \"  Higher  Loyal ty \"  rollout  and  all  the  hours  and  miles  being  devoted  to  it .  But  right  now  I 'm  cr inging  at  a  food  fight .

A  more  call ow ,  cunning ,  cowardly  and  self - interested  yet  mor onic  figure  you  couldn 't  find .  His  first  words  after  the  accident  are  : \"  I 'm  not  going  to  be  president .\"  Obviously ,  an  artist  isn 't  sadd led  with  the  same  obligations  to  fact  that  a  bi ographer  or  historian  is .  We  accept  artists  appropri ating  lives  and  altering  them .

Bi ographical  novels  like \"  I ,  Claud ius \"  or \"  Wolf  Hall \"  put  historical  figures  in  the  service  of  larger  themes  about  the  human  condition .  The  novelist  Joyce  Carol  O ates  attempted  to  do  that  with  Ch appa qu idd ick  in  her  novel \"  Black  Water ,\"  a  r oman  à  cle f  and  a  meditation  on  male  power  and  female  vulnerability .  Most  artists  understand  how  thin  the  line  between  art  and  gossip  can  be  when  one  deals  with  real - life  figures  in  semi - f ictional  contexts ,  which  is  why  most  artists  wait  until  those  figures  pass  into  what  seems  like \"  public  domain \"  --  ce asing  to  exist  as  particular ized  people  we  know  from  the  news  and  assuming  larger  cultural  proportions  that  turn  them  into  characters  we  don 't  fully  know .  Ted  Kennedy  has  not  passed  into  the  public  domain  in  this  sense ,  so  one  tamp ers  with  his  life  at  the  peril  of  turning  it  into  t aw dry  mel od rama .  This  is  especially  true  of  the  Kennedy  family ,  who  remain  politically  active ,  and  divisive .  Contrary  to  the  film 's  implications ,  Mr .  Kennedy  immediately  and  forever  after  felt  deep  remorse  and  responsibility  for  the  accident  ;  it  haunted  him .  By  the  end  of  his  life ,  however ,  the  then  white - man ed  senator  had  managed  to  transcend  celebrity  and  emotional  paralysis  and  become  what  he  had  long  as pired  to  be  :  an  indispensable  legislator  whose  achievements  included  the  18 - year - old  vote ,  the  Americans  With  Dis abilities  Act  and  the  Children 's  Health  Insurance  Program .  His  was  a  large - life ,  tragic  and  mult id imensional  figure ,  and  it  could  have  made ,  and  perhaps  someday  will  make ,  for  an  expansive  novel  or  film  about  sin  and  redemption .\"  Ch appa qu idd ick \"  is  not  that  movie .  Instead  of  excav ating  Kennedy  for  larger  artistic  aims ,  it  ev is cer ates  him  for  narrow  voy eur istic  ones .  But  this  is  about  more  than  Ted  Kennedy 's  legacy .  It  is  a  case  study  in  how  society  collectively  shapes  its  own  history .  It  is  not  merely ,  or  even  mainly ,  the  realm  of  historians .  Because  historical  figures  pass  out  of  history  and  into  popular  culture ,  and  because  that  process  is  accelerating ,  these  figures  are  increasingly  defined  by  popular  culture .  Artists  and  especially  entertain ers  may  not  feel  obligations  to  their  subjects ,  but  they  do  have  responsibilities  to  us ,  one  of  which  is  honesty .  Fake  history  is  no  better  than  fake  news  ;  it 's  maybe  worse .  It  is  very  possible  that  over  time ,  through  the  o sm osis  of  social  media ,  the  despicable  Kennedy  of  this  movie  will  eradicate <US_AUTHOR>...\n",

      "source text =  Edward  Kennedy ,  one  of  the  most  famous  members  of  America 's  most  famous  family ,  understood  that  he  belonged  as  much  to  popular  culture  as  to  political  culture .  Now ,  nine  years  after  his  death ,  comes  a  movie  about  the  event  that ,  almost  as  much  as  the  circumstances  of  his  birth ,  established  him  in  the  tabloid  pant heon  :  Ch appa qu idd ick .  The  film ,  by  the  same  name ,  opened  Friday  and  re tell s  the  story  of  an  accident  in  July  1969 ,  on  the  tit ular  Massachusetts  island  near  Martha 's  Vine yard ,  in  which  Mr .  Kennedy  drove  off  a  bridge ,  killing  his  passenger ,  Mary  Jo  K ope ch ne ,  a  campaign  worker  for  his  late  brother  Robert .  It  has  been  heavily  promoted  by  conservative  media  outlets ,  and  reviewers  across  the  political  spectrum  have  praised  what  they  deem  its  damning  but  factual  approach .  Dam ning  it  is  ;  factual  it  is  not .  Let 's  set  aside  the  fact  that ,  despite  the  film 's  advertisements  claiming  to  tell  the \"  untold  true  story \"  of  a \"  cover - up ,\"  the  story  has  been  told  plenty ,  and  no  one  but  the  most  lun atic  conspiracy  theorists  see  this  as  anything  but  a  tragic  accident  in  which  nothing  much  was  covered  up .  Let 's  also  put  aside  the  ske in  of  conjecture  and  outright  fabrication  that  the  film  un sp ools  --  in  one  scene  Joe  Kennedy ,  the  family  patriarch ,  murm urs \"  al ibi \"  to  his  son ,  like  a  Mafia  don ,  when  in  fact  he  was  so  deb ilit ated  by  a  stroke  that  he  could  only  bab ble  inco herent ly .  Setting  all  this  aside ,  the  movie  nevertheless  raises  a  serious  issue .  What  is  the  relationship  of  fact  to  fiction ,  of  the  historical  to  the  hist r ionic  in  art  and  entertainment ?  Ted  Kennedy  was  a  real  man  living  out  a  real  life .  His  political  opponents  could  and  did  distort  that  life  for  their  advantage .  But  just  how  many  liberties  can  an  artist  or  entertain er  take  when  he  or  she  deploy s  a  bi ographical  subject ?  Many  scenes  cross  from  dramatic  interpretation  to  outright  character  assassination .  In  this  version ,  the  Kennedy  character  leaves  K ope ch ne  to  die  as  she  gas ps  for  air ,  and  then ,  with  the  aid  of  his  brothers ' old  advisers ,  cooks  up  a  scheme  to  salvage  his  presidential  ambitions .  A  more  call ow ,  cunning ,  cowardly  and  self - interested  yet  mor onic  figure  you  couldn 't  find .  His  first  words  after  the  accident  are  : \"  I 'm  not  going  to  be  president .\"  Obviously ,  an  artist  isn 't  sadd led  with  the  same  obligations  to  fact  that  a  bi ographer  or  historian  is .  We  accept  artists  appropri ating  lives  and  altering  them .  But  we  also  expect  an  artist ically  valid  justification  for  bending  the  truth ,  and  sensational ism  isn 't  one  of  them .  Bi ographical  novels  like \"  I ,  Claud ius \"  or \"  Wolf  Hall \"  put  historical  figures  in  the  service  of  larger  themes  about  the  human  condition .  The  novelist  Joyce  Carol  O ates  attempted  to  do  that  with  Ch appa qu idd ick  in  her  novel \"  Black  Water ,\"  a  r oman  à  cle f  and  a  meditation  on  male  power  and  female  vulnerability .  Most  artists  understand  how  thin  the  line  between  art  and  gossip  can  be  when  one  deals  with  real - life  figures  in  semi - f ictional  contexts ,  which  is  why  most  artists  wait  until  those  figures  pass  into  what  seems  like \"  public  domain \"  --  ce asing  to  exist  as  particular ized  people  we  know  from  the  news  and  assuming  larger  cultural  proportions  that  turn  them  into  characters  we  don 't  fully  know .

The  American  military  commander  in  Afghanistan ,  Gen .  John  W .

He k mat ullah  was  a  key  commander  of  the  Islamic  State  in  Kh oras an ,  or  IS - K ,  as  the  Afghan  and  Pakistani  branch  of  the  Islamic  State  is  known .  General  Nicholson  described  the  killing  as  a  joint  operation  between  American  Special  Operations  troops  and  Afghan  Special  Security  Forces ,  and  said  it  was  the  latest  in  a  series  of  successful  efforts  to  kill  Islamic  State  leaders .\"  A .  S .  S .  F .  and  U .

Gen .  Mohammad  Rad man ish ,  said  that  Afghan - operated  drones  had  tracked  Mr .  He k mat ullah  to  his  hiding  place .  Afghan  officials  cited  photographs  apparently  showing  Mr .  He k mat ullah 's  body  as  confirmation  of  his  death .  The  killings  followed  a  series  of  setbacks  over  the  past  year  for  the  Islamic  State  in  N ang ar har  Province ,  in  eastern  Afghanistan .  American  strikes  have  killed  Islamic  State \"  em irs \"  and  other  leaders  in  that  region ,  while  government  ground  forces ,  supported  by  American  Special  Operations  troops  and  air  power ,  have  driven  the  group  from  many  areas  it  had  previously  held  in  the  province .  A  New  York  Times  reporter  who  visited  the  IS - K  stronghold  of  A chin  district  recently  found  government  forces  firmly  in  control  there .  The  Islamic  State  has  also  lost  most  of  its  territory  in  Syria  and  Iraq  in  recent  months ,  including  its  de  facto  capital  of  Raqqa ,  Syria ,  prompting  American  officials  to  express  concern  that  the  organization  would  turn  its  attention  to  Afghanistan .  They  cited  a  promotional  video  from  the  Islamic  State  ext oll ing  the  virtue  of  fighting  in  Kh oras an  --  the  group 's  name  for  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan  --  and  particularly  in  the  northern  province  of  J ow z jan  in  Afghanistan .  The  killing  of  Mr .  He k mat ullah  led  to  immediate  inf ighting  among  rival  factions  of  insurgents ,  who  disagreed  on  whom  his  successor  should  be ,  Afghan  government  officials  in  the  area  said .  Mr .  He k mat ullah ,  an  ethnic  Uzbek ,  was  a  fearsome  presence  in  J ow z jan ,  a  predominantly  Uzbek  region .  As  a  former  Taliban  commander  in  his  area ,  the  district  of  Dar z ab ,  he  became  notorious  for  such  extreme  sav ag ery  that  the  Taliban  expelled  him  from  the  organization ,  and  he  joined  the  Islamic  State .  Previously ,  he  had  also  been  a  leader  of  the  extremist  Islamic  Movement  of  Uzbek istan .  General  Nicholson  said  Mr .  He k mat ullah 's  death  was  a  blow  to  the  group 's  operations .\"  IS - K  in  J ow z jan  Province  is  the  main  conduit  for  external  support  and  foreign  fighters  from  Central  Asian  states  into  Afghanistan ,\"  he  said .\"  He k mat ullah  was  the  key  leader  for  those  operations ,\"  he  added .  Afghan  officials  described  Mr .

According  to  the  J ow z jan  deputy  police  chief ,  Haf iz  Kh ashi ,  after  Mr .  He k mat ullah 's  death ,  three  factions  of  his  Islamic  State  followers  began  fighting  one  another  to  determine  who  would  take  his  place .  He  said  those  factions  included  foreign  fighters  from  places  including  Che chn ya  and  Syria ,  followers  of  Mr .  He k mat ullah  from  his  home  district ,  and  Islamic  State  fighters  from  elsewhere  in  Afghanistan  who  had  joined  his  forces  in  the  north .  The  governor  of  J ow z jan ,  Maul vi  L ut full ah  Az iz i ,  said  the  killing  of  Mr .  He k mat ullah ,  and  the  inf ighting  that  resulted ,  had  come  just  in  time  to  prevent  Mr .

He k mat ullah 's  death  was  a  blow  to  the  group 's  operations .\"  IS - K  in  J ow z jan  Province  is  the  main  conduit  for  external  support  and  foreign  fighters  from  Central  Asian  states  into  Afghanistan ,\"  he  said .\"  He k mat ullah  was  the  key  leader  for  those  operations ,\"  he  added .  Afghan  officials  described  Mr .  He k mat ullah  as  running  Islamic  State  in  Kh oras an  operations  not  only  in  J ow z jan ,  but  also  in  the  provinces  of  Sar - i - P ul  and  F ary ab ,  which  are  also  in  the  north .  According  to  the  J ow z jan  deputy  police  chief ,  Haf iz  Kh ashi ,  after  Mr .  He k mat ullah 's  death ,  three  factions  of  his  Islamic  State  followers  began  fighting  one  another  to  determine  who  would  take  his  place .  He  said  those  factions  included  foreign  fighters  from  places  including  Che chn ya  and  Syria ,  followers  of  Mr .  He k mat ullah  from  his  home  district ,  and  Islamic  State  fighters  from  elsewhere  in  Afghanistan  who  had  joined  his  forces  in  the  north .  The  governor  of  J ow z jan ,  Maul vi  L ut full ah  Az iz i ,  said  the  killing  of  Mr .  He k mat ullah ,  and  the  inf ighting  that  resulted ,  had  come  just  in  time  to  prevent  Mr .  He k mat ullah 's  fighters  from  over running  government  forces  holding  the  district  center  of  Dar z ab .\"  He  was  very  powerful  and  commanded  up  to  500  armed  fighters ,\"  Mr .  Az iz i  said .\"  When  he  and  his  body guard  were  killed ,  his  forces  were  within  50  meters  of  the  district  center .\"  Hundreds  of  miles  to  the  southeast ,  the  district  of  A chin ,  in  N ang ar har ,  heavily  dominated  by  the  Islamic  State  in  Kh oras an  a  year  ago ,  is  now  largely  under  government  control ,  according  to  officials  and  village  elders  there .  Mohammad  Is mail  Shin w ari ,  the  governor  of  A chin ,  said  schools  were  re opening  and  4 ,  000  displaced  families  had  returned ,  although  another  2 ,  000  families  were  yet  to  come  back .\"  ISIS  is  no  longer  strong  in  this  district ,\"  he  said .  The  Islamic  State  has  proved  capable  of  replen ishing  its  forces  in  the  past ,  however .  Last  April ,  for  instance ,  the  American  military  said  it  had  reduced  the  extremists ' n umbers  from  3 ,  000  to  700 .  Then ,  last  December <COMMENT_LEN_0_AUTHOR>...\n",

We  have  a  strong  manufacturing  base  in  our  county  ;  when  tariffs  on  aluminum  and  steel  were  announced ,  local  manufacturing  leaders  tried  to  be  diplomatic ,  praising  the  Trump  tax  cuts  but  saying  the  steel  and  aluminum  tariffs  would  hurt  their  businesses  by  driving  costs  up .

      "source text =  —  On  the  morning  after ,  President  Trump  declared  success .  The  surgical  strike  against  chemical  weapons  facilities  in  Syria  had  been  executed  perfectly ,  he  said  on  Saturday .  � �  Mission  Acc ompl ished ! � �  he  wrote  on  Twitter .  That  � �  s  a  phrase  presidents  and  politicians  have  stud iously  avoided  since  President  George  W .  Bush  � �  s  ill - f ated  aircraft  carrier  visit  prematurely  declaring  success  in  the  Iraq  war .  But  aside  from  the  curious  choice  of  words ,  it  raised  the  essential  question  regarding  Syria  going  beyond  the  one - time  strike  :  What  exactly  is  the  mission ?  For  most  of  Mr .  Trump  � �  s  presidency ,  it  has  been  to  defeat  the  Islamic  State  and  then  get  out .  But  what  Mr .  Trump  outlined  in  his  televised  speech  to  the  nation  on  Friday  night  was  something  more  complicated .  He  promised  a  sustained  campaign  to  stop  Syria  � �  s  government  from  again  using  chemical  weapons  on  its  own  people ,  while  also  emphasizing  the  limits  of  America  � �  s  ability  or  willingness  to  do  more  to  stop  the  broader  blood let ting  that  has  devastated  that  country  for  seven  years .  Mr .  Trump  finds  himself  in  a  position  not  all  that  different  from  that  of  his  predecessor ,  President  Barack  Obama ,  and  with  no  easier  answers .  The  strike  brought  home  Mr .  Trump  � �  s  competing  impulses  when  it  comes  to  Syria  —  on  the  one  hand ,  his  man ful  chest - th umping  intended  to  demonstrate  that  he  is  the  toughest  one  on  the  international  block ,  and  on  the  other ,  his  deep  conviction  that  American  involvement  in  the  Middle  East  since  the  attacks  of  Sept .  11 ,  2001 ,  has  been  a  waste  of  blood  and  treasure .  He  did  little  to  reconcile  those  impulses  with  his  retali atory  strike  to  punish  the  government  of  President  Bashar  al - Assad  for  a  suspected  chemical  attack  a  week  ago  that  killed  dozens  of  people .

Some  15 .  5  million  Americans  have  been  taking  the  medications  for  at  least  five  years .  The  rate  has  almost  doubled  since  2010 ,  and  more  than  tripled  since  2000 .  Nearly  25  million  adults ,  like  Ms .  T oline ,  have  been  on  antidepressants  for  at  least  two  years ,  a  60  percent  increase  since  2010 .  The  drugs  have  helped  millions  of  people  ease  depression  and  anxiety ,  and  are  widely  regarded  as  milestones  in  psychiatric  treatment .  Many ,  perhaps  most ,  people  stop  the  medications  without  significant  trouble .  But  the  rise  in  longtime  use  is  also  the  result  of  an  un anticipated  and  growing  problem  :  Many  who  try  to  quit  say  they  cannot  because  of  withdrawal  symptoms  they  were  never  warned  about .  Some  scientists  long  ago  anticipated  that  a  few  patients  might  experience  withdrawal  symptoms  if  they  tried  to  stop  --  they  called  it \"  discontin uation  syndrome .\"  Yet  withdrawal  has  never  been  a  focus  of  drug  makers  or  government  regulators ,  who  felt  antidepressants  could  not  be  addictive  and  did  far  more  good  than  harm .  The  drugs  initially  were  approved  for  short - term  use ,  following  studies  typically  lasting  about  two  months .  Even  today ,  there  is  little  data  about  their  effects  on  people  taking  them  for  years ,  although  there  are  now  millions  of  such  users .  Exp anding  use  of  antidepressants  is  not  just  an  issue  in  the  United  States .  Across  much  of  the  developed  world ,  long - term  prescriptions  are  on  the  rise .  Pres cription  rates  have  doubled  over  the  past  decade  in  Britain ,  where  health  officials  in  January  began  a  nationwide  review  of  prescription  drug  dependence  and  withdrawal .  In  New  Zealand ,  where  prescriptions  are  also  at  historic  highs ,  a  survey  of  long - term  users  found  that  withdrawal  was  the  most  common  complaint ,  cited  by  three - quarters  of  long - term  users .  Yet  the  medical  profession  has  no  good  answer  for  people  struggling  to  stop  taking  the  drugs  --  no  scientifically  backed  guidelines ,  no  means  to  determine  who 's  at  highest  risk ,  no  way  to  tailor  appropriate  strategies  to  individuals .\"  Some  people  are  essentially  being  parked  on  these  drugs  for  convenience 's  sake  because  it 's  difficult  to  tackle  the  issue  of  taking  them  off ,\"  said  Dr .  Anthony  Kendrick ,  a  professor  of  primary  care  at  the  University  of  Southampton  in  Britain .  With  government  funding ,  he  is  developing  online  and  telephone  support  to  help  practitioners  and  patients .\"  Should  we  really  be  putting  so  many  people  on  antidepressants  long - term  when  we  don 't  know  if  it 's  good  for  them ,  or  whether  they 'll  be  able  to  come  off ?\"  he  said .  Ant idepress ants  were  originally  considered  a  short - term  treatment  for  epis odic  mood  problems ,  to  be  taken  for  six  to  nine  months  :  enough  to  get  through  a  crisis ,  and  no  more .  Later  studies  suggested  that \"  maintenance  therapy \"  --  longer - term  and  often  open - ended  use  --  could  prevent  a  return  of  depression  in  some  patients ,  but  those  trials  very  rarely  lasted  more  than  two  years .  Once  a  drug  is  approved ,  physicians  in  the  United  States  have  wide  latitude  to  prescribe  it  as  they  see  fit .  The  lack  of  long - term  data  did  not  prevent  doctors  from  placing  tens  of  millions  of  Americans  on  antidepressants  indefinitely .\"  Most  people  are  put  on  these  drugs  in  primary  care ,  after  a  very  brief  visit  and  without  clear  symptoms  of  clinical  depression ,\"  said  Dr .  Allen  Frances ,  a  professor  emer itus  of  psychiatry  at  Duke  University .\"  Usually  there 's  improvement ,  and  often  it 's  based  on  the  passage  of  time  or  placebo  effect .\"  But  the  patient  and  doctor  don 't  know  this  and  give  the  antidepressant  credit  it  doesn 't  deserve .  Both  are  reluctant  to  stop  what  appears  to  be  a  winner ,  and  the  useless  prescription  may  be  continued  for  years  --  or  a  lifetime .\"  The  Times  analyzed  data  gathered  since  1999  as  part  of  the  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey .  Over  all ,  more  than  34 .  4  million  adults  took  antidepressants  in  2013 - 4 ,  up  from  13 .  4  million  in  the  1999 - 2000  survey .  Adults  over  45 ,  women  and  whites  are  more  likely  to  take  antidepressants  than  younger  adults ,  men  and  minorities .  But  usage  is  increasing  in  older  adults  across  the  demographic  spectrum .  White  women  over  45  account  for  about  one - fifth  of  the  adult  population  but  account  for  41  percent  of  antidepressant  users ,  up  from  about  30  percent  in  2000 ,  the  analysis  found .  Older  white  women  account  for  58  percent  of  those  on  antidepressants  long  term .\"  What  you  see  is  the  number  of  long <US_AUTHOR>...\n",

It  was  a  delicate  operation  that  had  become  a  daily  routine  --  extracting  ever  tin ier  doses  of  the  antidepressant  she  had  taken  for  three  years ,  on  and  off ,  and  was  desperately  trying  to  quit .\"  Basically  that 's  all  I  have  been  doing  --  dealing  with  the  dizz iness ,  the  confusion ,  the  fatigue ,  all  the  symptoms  of  withdrawal ,\"  said  Ms .  T oline ,  27 ,  of  Tacoma ,  Wash .  It  took  nine  months  to  we an  herself  from  the  drug ,  Z ol oft ,  by  taking  increasingly  smaller  doses .\"  I  couldn 't  finish  my  college  degree ,\"  she  said .\"  Only  now  am  I  feeling  well  enough  to  try  to  re - enter  society  and  go  back  to  work .\"  Long - term  use  of  antidepressants  is  surging  in  the  United  States ,  according  to  a  new  analysis  of  federal  data  by  The  New  York  Times .  Some  15 .  5  million  Americans  have  been  taking  the  medications  for  at  least  five  years .  The  rate  has  almost  doubled  since  2010 ,  and  more  than  tripled  since  2000 .  Nearly  25  million  adults ,  like  Ms .  T oline ,  have  been  on  antidepressants  for  at  least  two  years ,  a  60  percent  increase  since  2010 .  The  drugs  have  helped  millions  of  people  ease  depression  and  anxiety ,  and  are  widely  regarded  as  milestones  in  psychiatric  treatment .  Many ,  perhaps  most ,  people  stop  the  medications  without  significant  trouble .  But  the  rise  in  longtime  use  is  also  the  result  of  an  un anticipated  and  growing  problem  :  Many  who  try  to  quit  say  they  cannot  because  of  withdrawal  symptoms  they  were  never  warned  about .  Some  scientists  long  ago  anticipated  that  a  few  patients  might  experience  withdrawal  symptoms  if  they  tried  to  stop  --  they  called  it \"  discontin uation  syndrome .\"  Yet  withdrawal  has  never  been  a  focus  of  drug  makers  or  government  regulators ,  who  felt  antidepressants  could  not  be  addictive  and  did  far  more  good  than  harm .  The  drugs  initially  were  approved  for  short - term  use ,  following  studies  typically  lasting  about  two  months .  Even  today ,  there  is  little  data  about  their  effects  on  people  taking  them  for  years ,  although  there  are  now  millions  of  such  users .  Exp anding  use  of  antidepressants  is  not  just  an  issue  in  the  United  States .  Across  much  of  the  developed  world ,  long - term  prescriptions  are  on  the  rise .  Pres cription  rates  have  doubled  over  the  past  decade  in  Britain ,  where  health  officials  in  January  began  a  nationwide  review  of  prescription  drug  dependence  and  withdrawal .  In  New  Zealand ,  where  prescriptions  are  also  at  historic  highs ,  a  survey  of  long - term  users  found  that  withdrawal  was  the  most  common  complaint ,  cited  by  three - quarters  of  long - term  users .  Yet  the  medical  profession  has  no  good  answer  for  people  struggling  to  stop  taking  the  drugs  --  no  scientifically  backed  guidelines ,  no  means  to  determine  who 's  at  highest  risk ,  no  way  to  tailor  appropriate  strategies  to  individuals .\"  Some  people  are  essentially  being  parked  on  these  drugs  for  convenience 's  sake  because  it 's  difficult  to  tackle  the  issue  of  taking  them  off ,\"  said  Dr .  Anthony  Kendrick ,  a  professor  of  primary  care  at  the  University  of  Southampton  in  Britain .  With  government  funding ,  he  is  developing  online  and  telephone  support  to  help  practitioners  and  patients .\"  Should  we  really  be  putting  so  many  people  on  antidepressants  long - term  when  we  don 't  know  if  it 's  good  for  them ,  or  whether  they 'll  be  able  to  come  off ?\"  he  said .  Ant idepress ants  were  originally  considered  a  short - term  treatment  for  epis odic  mood  problems ,  to  be  taken  for  six  to  nine  months  :  enough  to  get  through  a  crisis ,  and  no  more .  Later  studies  suggested  that \"  maintenance  therapy \"  --  longer - term  and  often  open - ended  use  --  could  prevent  a  return  of  depression  in  some  patients ,  but  those  trials  very  rarely  lasted  more  than  two  years .  Once  a  drug  is  approved ,  physicians  in  the  United  States  have  wide  latitude  to  prescribe  it  as  they  see  fit .  The  lack  of  long - term  data  did  not  prevent  doctors  from  placing  tens  of  millions  of  Americans  on  antidepressants  indefinitely .\"  Most  people  are  put  on  these  drugs  in  primary  care ,  after  a  very  brief  visit  and  without  clear  symptoms  of  clinical  depression ,\"  said  Dr .  Allen  Frances ,  a  professor  emer itus  of  psychiatry  at  Duke  University .\"  Usually  there 's  improvement ,  and  often  it 's  based  on  the  passage  of  time  or  placebo  effect .\"  But  the  patient  and  doctor  don 't  know  this  and  give  the  antidepressant  credit  it  doesn 't  deserve .  Both  are  reluctant  to  stop  what  appears  to  be  a  winner ,  and  the  useless  prescription  may  be  continued  for  years  --  or  a  lifetime .\"  The  Times  analyzed  data  gathered  since  1999  as  part  of  the  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey .  Over  all ,  more  than  34 .  4  million  adults  took  antidepressants  in  2013 - 4 ,  up  from  13 .  4  million  in  the  1999 - 2000  survey .  Adults  over  45 ,  women  and  whites  are  more  likely  to  take  antidepressants  than  younger  adults ,  men  and  minorities .  But  usage  is  increasing  in  older  adults  across  the  demographic  spectrum .  White  women  over  45  account  for  about  one - fifth  of  the  adult  population  but  account  for  41  percent  of  antidepressant  users ,  up  from  about  30  percent  in  2000 ,  the  analysis  found .

If  there  are  some  ideas  that  never  seem  to  go  away  --  congestion  pricing  anyone ?  --  residents ' park ing  is  surely  one  of  them .  The  idea  is  to  relieve  some  of  the  parking  pressure  on  city  residents  by  reserv ing  up  to  80  percent  of  the  coveted  cur bs ide  spots  in  some  neighborhoods  for  those  with  permits  --  and  essentially  declaring  those  parking  places  off  limits  to  suburban  commuters  and  tourists .  While  such  residential  parking  permits  are  a  main stay  around  the  country ,  including  in  Boston ,  Washington  and  Chicago ,  the  system  has  never  advanced  in  New  York  City  despite  repeated  attempts  over  the  years  --  in  part  because  it  would  require  state  approval .  This  time ,  enthusiasm  for  the  proposal  has  spurred  not  one ,  but  two  separate  City  Council  bills ,  both  of  which  are  to  be  introduced  Wednesday .  Council man  Y dan is  Rodriguez ,  who  represents  Washington  Heights ,  In wood  and  Marble  Hill  and  is  the  chairman  of  the  Council 's  transportation  committee ,  is  calling  for  a  city wide  residential  parking  program .  Three  fellow  Council  members  --  Mark  Levine ,  Helen  Rosenthal  and  Keith  Powers ,  all  representing  Manhattan  districts  --  are  proposing  a  more  limited  program  for  the  borough ,  from  60 th  Street  to  Manhattan 's  northern  tip ,  on  both  the  East  and  West  sides .\"  This  has  always  been  popular  with  residents ,\"  said  Mr .  Levine ,  a  Democrat  whose  district  includes  M ornings ide  Heights  and  Hamilton  Heights .\"  And  their  frustration  now  is  boiling  over .\"  Mr .  Levine  added  that  he  has  received  more  complaints  in  recent  years  from  residents  who  are  increasingly  competing  for  free  cur bs ide  parking  with  commuters  from  New  Jersey  and  West chester  County .\"  For  one  reason  or  another ,  they  are  dumping  their  cars  upt own  and  that 's  crowd ing  out  neighborhood  residents ,\"  he  said .  Both  bills ,  if  approved ,  would  charge  the  city 's  Department  of  Transportation  with  developing  the  details  of  a  residential  parking  program  --  where  and  when  the  permits  would  be  required ,  how  much  they  would  cost  and  any  penalties  for  violations  --  with  input  from  community  boards  and  elected  officials .  Under  the  proposals ,  a  residential  permit  system  would  exclude  parking  spots  that  are  met ered  or  in  commercial  zones  used  for  deliveries .  It  would  apply  to  residential  streets ,  including  side  streets ,  at  certain  times  such  as  rush  hours .  A  spokeswoman  for  Council  Speaker  Corey  Johnson  said  the  speaker  was  reviewing  the  bills .  A  spokesman  for  Mayor  Bill  de  Blasio  said  the  mayor  would  review  the  bills  when  they  were  introduced .  But  state  legislative  leaders  and  city  transportation  officials  emphasized  that  any  residential  parking  program  would  still  require  the  approval  of  the  Legislature ,  though  Mr .  Levine  said  he  believed  the  city  had  the  authority  to  act  without  Albany .  At  least  20  local ities ,  including  Albany  and  Buffalo ,  have  received  state  legislation  authorizing  some  form  of  residential  parking ,  but  not  New  York  City .\"  We  haven 't  seen  the  details  of  the  proposals  and  we  would  have  to  review  the  issue  with  our  members ,\"  said  Michael  Why land ,  a  spokesman  for  Assembly  Speaker  Carl  E .  He ast ie ,  a  Democrat  from  the  Bronx .  In  2011 ,  the  City  Council  pushed  residential  parking  permits ,  spurred  by  concerns  that  the  soon - to - open  Barclays  Center  in  Brooklyn  would  draw  heavy  traffic  that  would  pose  a  danger  to  pedestrians ,  worsen  pollution  and  make  parking  even  more  difficult  to  find .  Mayor  Michael  R .  Bloomberg 's  2008  plan  for  congestion  pricing  also  included  residential  parking  permits .  Neither  effort  got  much  traction  in  Albany .  Mr .  Rodriguez  said  he  has  been  talking  to  state  legislators  to  build  support  for  residential  parking  permits ,  and  would  also  be  looking  at  other  legal  options .  He  said  he  would  be  holding  a  hearing  on  the  bills  in  the  next  few  months .  Both  Mr .  Rodriguez  and  Mr .  Levine  said  they  would  work  together  and  viewed  their  separate  bills  going  hand - in - hand  to  create  a  comprehensive  parking  policy  for  the  city .  The  proposals  drew  criticism  from  non res idents  like  Oscar  Lopez ,  28 ,  who  drove  his  white  BMW  with  New  Jersey  plates  off  the  George  Washington  Bridge  on  Tuesday  and  immediately  began  looking  for  parking .\"  This  is  a  public  street ,  and  if  I  spend  an  hour  looking  for  a  parking  space ,  I  have  just  as  much  right  as  anyone  to  have  it ,\"  he  said .  Other  drivers  opposed  what  they  saw  as  an  effort  by  the  city  to  regulate  parking .  Kevin  S acco ,  66 ,  a  commercial  artist  in  M ornings ide  Heights  who  had  parked  in  the  neighborhood  Tuesday ,  said  that  securing  parking  spots  was  a  vital  part  of  New  Yorkers ' h ust le ,  and  government  should  not  get  involved .

      "source text =  after  another ,  the  cars  with  out - of - state  license  plates  roll  off  the  George  Washington  Bridge  into  Pedro  Richie z 's  neighborhood  in  northern  Manhattan .  They  circle  the  blocks .  They  nab  parking  spots  as  soon  as  they  open  up .\"  It 's  been  getting  worse  over  the  years ,\"  said  Mr .  Richie z ,  50 ,  a  building  superintendent ,  as  he  sat  in  his  blue  min ivan  on  West  176 th  Street  for  two  hours  on  Tuesday  waiting  for  a  parking  spot .\"  All  these  outsiders  driving  in  and  parking  in  our  neighborhood  and  then  hopping  on  the  subway  downtown ,  instead  of  paying  for  a  parking  garage  in  Mid town .\"  Now ,  some  New  Yorkers  want  to  take  back  parking  spots  for  neighborhood  drivers  --  again .  If  there  are  some  ideas  that  never  seem  to  go  away  --  congestion  pricing  anyone ?  --  residents ' park ing  is  surely  one  of  them .  The  idea  is  to  relieve  some  of  the  parking  pressure  on  city  residents  by  reserv ing  up  to  80  percent  of  the  coveted  cur bs ide  spots  in  some  neighborhoods  for  those  with  permits  --  and  essentially  declaring  those  parking  places  off  limits  to  suburban  commuters  and  tourists .  While  such  residential  parking  permits  are  a  main stay  around  the  country ,  including  in  Boston ,  Washington  and  Chicago ,  the  system  has  never  advanced  in  New  York  City  despite  repeated  attempts  over  the  years  --  in  part  because  it  would  require  state  approval .  This  time ,  enthusiasm  for  the  proposal  has  spurred  not  one ,  but  two  separate  City  Council  bills ,  both  of  which  are  to  be  introduced  Wednesday .  Council man  Y dan is  Rodriguez ,  who  represents  Washington  Heights ,  In wood  and  Marble  Hill  and  is  the  chairman  of  the  Council 's  transportation  committee ,  is  calling  for  a  city wide  residential  parking  program .  Three  fellow  Council  members  --  Mark  Levine ,  Helen  Rosenthal  and  Keith  Powers ,  all  representing  Manhattan  districts  --  are  proposing  a  more  limited  program  for  the  borough ,  from  60 th  Street  to  Manhattan 's  northern  tip ,  on  both  the  East  and  West  sides .\"  This  has  always  been  popular  with  residents ,\"  said  Mr .  Levine ,  a  Democrat  whose  district  includes  M ornings ide  Heights  and  Hamilton  Heights .\"  And  their  frustration  now  is  boiling  over .\"  Mr .  Levine  added  that  he  has  received  more  complaints  in  recent  years  from  residents  who  are  increasingly  competing  for  free  cur bs ide  parking  with  commuters  from  New  Jersey  and  West chester  County .\"  For  one  reason  or  another ,  they  are  dumping  their  cars  upt own  and  that 's  crowd ing  out  neighborhood  residents ,\"  he  said .  Both  bills ,  if  approved ,  would  charge  the  city 's  Department  of  Transportation  with  developing  the  details  of  a  residential  parking  program  --  where  and  when  the  permits  would  be  required ,  how  much  they  would  cost  and  any  penalties  for  violations  --  with  input  from  community  boards  and  elected  officials .  Under  the  proposals ,  a  residential  permit  system  would  exclude  parking  spots  that  are  met ered  or  in  commercial  zones  used  for  deliveries .  It  would  apply  to  residential  streets ,  including  side  streets ,  at  certain  times  such  as  rush  hours .  A  spokeswoman  for  Council  Speaker  Corey  Johnson  said  the  speaker  was  reviewing  the  bills .

We  accept  artists  appropri ating  lives  and  altering  them .  But  we  also  expect  an  artist ically  valid  justification  for  bending  the  truth ,  and  sensational ism  isn 't  one  of  them .  Bi ographical  novels  like \"  I ,  Claud ius \"  or \"  Wolf  Hall \"  put  historical  figures  in  the  service  of  larger  themes  about  the  human  condition .  The  novelist  Joyce  Carol  O ates  attempted  to  do  that  with  Ch appa qu idd ick  in  her  novel \"  Black  Water ,\"  a  r oman  à  cle f  and  a  meditation  on  male  power  and  female  vulnerability .  Most  artists  understand  how  thin  the  line  between  art  and  gossip  can  be  when  one  deals  with  real - life  figures  in  semi - f ictional  contexts ,  which  is  why  most  artists  wait  until  those  figures  pass  into  what  seems  like \"  public  domain \"  --  ce asing  to  exist  as  particular ized  people  we  know  from  the  news  and  assuming  larger  cultural  proportions  that  turn  them  into  characters  we  don 't  fully  know .  Ted  Kennedy  has  not  passed  into  the  public  domain  in  this  sense ,  so  one  tamp ers  with  his  life  at  the  peril  of  turning  it  into  t aw dry  mel od rama .  This  is  especially  true  of  the  Kennedy  family ,  who  remain  politically  active ,  and  divisive .  Contrary  to  the  film 's  implications ,  Mr .  Kennedy  immediately  and  forever  after  felt  deep  remorse  and  responsibility  for  the  accident  ;  it  haunted  him .  By  the  end  of  his  life ,  however ,  the  then  white - man ed  senator  had  managed  to  transcend  celebrity  and  emotional  paralysis  and  become  what  he  had  long  as pired  to  be  :  an  indispensable  legislator  whose  achievements  included  the  18 - year - old  vote ,  the  Americans  With  Dis abilities  Act  and  the  Children 's  Health  Insurance  Program .  His  was  a  large - life ,  tragic  and  mult id imensional  figure ,  and  it  could  have  made ,  and  perhaps  someday  will  make ,  for  an  expansive  novel  or  film  about  sin  and  redemption .\"  Ch appa qu idd ick \"  is  not  that  movie .  Instead  of  excav ating  Kennedy  for  larger  artistic  aims ,  it  ev is cer ates  him  for  narrow  voy eur istic  ones .  But  this  is  about  more  than  Ted  Kennedy 's  legacy .  It  is  a  case  study  in  how  society  collectively  shapes  its  own  history .  It  is  not  merely ,  or  even  mainly ,  the  realm  of  historians .  Because  historical  figures  pass  out  of  history  and  into  popular  culture ,  and  because  that  process  is  accelerating ,  these  figures  are  increasingly  defined  by  popular  culture .  Artists  and  especially  entertain ers  may  not  feel  obligations  to  their  subjects ,  but  they  do  have  responsibilities  to  us ,  one  of  which  is  honesty .  Fake  history  is  no  better  than  fake  news  ;  it 's  maybe  worse .  It  is  very  possible  that  over  time ,  through  the  o sm osis  of  social  media ,  the  despicable  Kennedy  of  this  movie  will  eradicate <COMMENT_LEN_0_AUTHOR>...\n",

It  also  announced  that  President  Trump  was  nominating  the  White  House  physician  to  head  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs .  What  do  these  announcements  have  in  common ?  The  answer  is  that  both  are  indicators  of  how  Trump  views  his  job .  He  doesn 't  seem  to  see  actual  policy making  as  important  ;  instead ,  he  treats  it  all  as  an  exercise  in  reality  TV .  Unfortunately ,  what  looks  good  on  TV  isn 't  necessarily  good  for  America ,  or  the  world .  Ron ny  L .  Jackson ,  the  veterans  affairs  nominee ,  certainly  looks  good  on  TV ,  as  we  saw  when  he  gave  Trump  an  excellent  bill  of  health ,  including  a  declaration  that  the  president ,  while  overweight ,  is  just  shy  of  being  officially  obese  --  thanks  to  having  apparently  grown  an  inch  in  office .  However ,  gir ther ism  isn 't  the  real  issue  here  ;  as  David  Axel rod  says ,\"  a  waist  is  a  terrible  thing  to  mind .\"  The  point ,  instead ,  is  that  running  veterans ' health  is  a  management ,  not  medical ,  job  --  and  Jackson  has  no  managerial  experience .  But  what  does  this  have  to  do  with  trade  deals ?  Well ,  last  week  the  stock  market  plunged  on  fears  that  Trump  was  getting  ready  to  begin  his  long - threat ened  trade  war .  But  then  it  made  a  partial  comeback ,  as  investors  decided  that  he  was  mainly  h uff ing  and  puff ing .  That  Korea  deal  supports  the  h uff ing - and - puff ing  view .  Although  hyp ed  as  a  major  victory ,  it 's  basically  a  nothing bur ger  in  terms  of  its  actual  content .  Korea  will  increase  quotas  that  U .  S .  companies  aren 't  filling  anyway  and  will  divert  a  few  percent  of  its  steel  exports  to  other  destinations .  It 's  hard  to  escape  the  sense  that  the  goal  was  to  announce  something ,  never  mind  the  content ,  and  call  it  a  victory .  Once  you  start  looking  at  the  Trump  administration  as  an  exercise  in  publicity ,  not  policy ,  you  see  signs  of  it  everywhere .  For  example ,  the  director  of  the  National  Economic  Council  is  often  described  as  the  president 's  chief  economist ,  but  that 's  not  quite  right .  What  the  person  holding  that  job  is  supposed  to  do  is  act  as  a  coordinator  :  making  sure  that  the  president  receives  coherent  economic  advice ,  that  policy making  in  different  departments  is  consistent  with  the  administration 's  overall  vision ,  and  so  on .  Obviously ,  this  requires  a  good  enough  understanding  of  economics  to  recognize  good  and  bad  advice ,  but  it  also  requires  other  skills ,  managerial  and  diplomatic  ;  basically ,  the  council 's  director  has  to  be  an  honest  and  effective  broker  of  other  people 's  ideas  and  actions .  So  when  Trump  chose  Larry  K ud low  to  replace  Gary  Cohn  in  that  role ,  K ud low 's  remarkable  track  record  on  the  economy  --  he 's  been  wrong  about  everything  --  was  only  part  of  the  problem .  Beyond  that ,  nothing  in  K ud low 's  role  as  a  shouting  head  on  cable  TV  has  prepared  him  for  the  job  he 's  supposed  to  do .  But  no  matter  :  According  to  K ud low ,  the  president  says  he  looks \"  very  handsome \"  on  TV .  So  Trump  is  acting  as  if  his  job  were  to  run  up  ratings  for  his  TV  show ,  not  to  make  actual  policies .  And  in  some  ways  this  could  be  a  good  thing ,  since  Trump 's  policy  ideas  are  often  terrible .  As  I  said ,  Wall  Street  had  a  big  relief  rally  when  investors  tent atively  concluded  that  Trump  wants  to  only  play  at  trade  war ,  and  can  be  bought  off  with  symbolic  wins  that  change  nothing  real .  Yet  America  still  needs  to  be  governed ,  and  Trump 's  lack  of  seriousness  has  consequences .

Trump  hasn 't  managed  to  repeal  Obamacare ,  but  his  officials  have  undermined  the  program 's  efficiency ,  driving  up  premiums  and  reducing  coverage .  Meanwhile ,  deaths  and  illness  due  to  the  collapse  of  environmental  enforcement  will  be  one  of  Trump 's  enduring  leg acies .  Another  consequence  is  that  if  and  when  America  needs  real  leadership ,  there  will  be  nobody  home .  So  far ,  the  Trump  era  has  been  almost  free  from  crises  Trump  didn 't  generate  himself .

Cohen ,  on  Monday  morning ,  seizing  business  records ,  emails  and  documents  related  to  several  topics ,  including  a  payment  to  a  pornographic  film  actress .  Mr .  Trump ,  in  an  extraordinarily  angry  response ,  lashed  out  hours  later  at  what  a  person  briefed  on  the  matter  said  was  an  investigation  into  possible  bank  fraud  by  Mr .  Cohen .  Mr .  Trump  accused  his  own  Justice  Department  of  perpet rating  a \"  witch  hunt \"  and  asserted  that  the  F .  B .  I .\"  broke  in  to \"  Mr .  Cohen 's  office .

The  documents  identified  in  the  warrant  date  back  years ,  according  to  a  person  briefed  on  the  search .  The  prosecutors  obtained  the  search  warrant  after  receiving  a  referral  from  the  special  counsel  in  the  Russia  investigation ,  Robert  S .  Mueller  III ,  according  to  Mr .

      "source text = LA H OM A  CITY  --  Early  in  Scott  Pruitt 's  political  career ,  as  a  state  senator  from  Tulsa ,  he  attended  a  gathering  at  the  Oklahoma  City  home  of  an  influential  telecommunications  lobbyist  who  was  nearing  retirement  and  about  to  move  away .  The  lobbyist  said  that  after  the  2003  gathering ,  Mr .  Pruitt  --  who  had  a  modest  legal  practice  and  a  state  salary  of  $  38 ,  400  --  reached  out  to  her .  He  wanted  to  buy  her  show place  home  as  a  second  residence  for  when  he  was  in  the  state  capital .\"  For  those  ego - minded  politicians ,  it  would  be  pretty  cool  to  have  this  house  close  to  the  cap itol ,\"  said  the  lobbyist ,  Mars ha  Lindsey .\"  It  was  stunning .\"  Soon  Mr .  Pruitt  was  staying  there ,  and  so  was  at  least  one  other  lawmaker ,  according  to  interviews .  Mr .  Pruitt  even  bought  Ms .  Lindsey 's  dining  room  set ,  art  and  antique  r ugs ,  she  said .  A  review  of  real  estate  and  other  public  records  shows  that  Mr .  Pruitt  was  not  the  sole  owner  :  The  property  was  held  by  a  shell  company  registered  to  a  business  partner  and  law  school  friend ,  Kenneth  Wagner .  Mr .  Wagner  now  holds  a  top  political  job  at  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency ,  where  Mr .  Pruitt ,  49 ,  is  the  administrator .  The  mortgage  on  the  Oklahoma  City  home ,  the  records  show ,  was  issued  by  a  local  bank  that  was  led  by  another  business  associate  of  Mr .  Pruitt 's ,  Albert  Kelly .  Recently  barred  from  working  in  the  finance  industry  because  of  a  banking  violation ,  Mr .  Kelly  is  now  one  of  Mr .  Pruitt 's  top  aides  at  the  E .  P .  A .  and  runs  the  agency 's  Super fund  program .  At  the  E .  P .  A .,  Mr .  Pruitt  is  under  investigation  for  allegations  of  unchecked  spending ,  ethics  laps es  and  other  issues ,  including  his  interactions  with  lobbyists .  An  examination  of  Mr .  Pruitt 's  political  career  in  Oklahoma  reveals  that  many  of  the  pitfalls  he  has  encountered  in  Washington  have  echoes  in  his  past .  According  to  real  estate  records ,  the  2003  purchase  of  the  house  for  $  375 ,  000  came  at  a  steep  discount  of  about  $  100 ,  000  from  what  Ms .  Lindsey  had  paid  a  year  earlier  --  a  shortfall  picked  up  by  her  employer ,  the  telecom  giant  S BC  Oklahoma .  S BC ,  previously  known  as  South western  Bell  and  later  as  AT  &  T ,  had  been  lobbying  lawmakers  in  the  early  2000 s  on  a  range  of  matters ,  including  a  deregulation  bill  that  would  allow  it  to  raise  rates  and  a  separate  regulatory  effort  to  reopen  a  bribery  case  from  a  decade  earlier .  Mr .  Pruitt  sided  with  the  company  on  both  matters ,  state  records  show .  In  2005 ,  the  shell  company  --  Capitol  House  L .  L .  C .  --  sold  the  property  for  $  95 ,  000  more  than  it  had  paid .  While  shell  companies  are  legal ,  they  often  obscure  the  people  who  have  an  interest  in  them ,  and  none  of  Mr .  Pruitt 's  financial  disclosure  filings  in  Oklahoma  mentioned  the  company  or  the  proceeds  --  a  potential  violation  of  the  state 's  ethics  rules .  The  Oklahoma  City  deal ,  which  has  not  been  previously  reported ,  was  one  of  several  instances  in  which  Mr .  Pruitt  appeared  to  have  benefited  from  his  relationships  with  Mr .  Kelly  and  Mr .  Wagner  while  in  state  politics .  During  his  eight  years  as  a  Republican  state  senator ,  Mr .  Pruitt  also  upgraded  his  family  residence  in  suburban  Tulsa  from  a  small  ranch - style  home  to  a  lake front  property  in  a  g ated  community .  In  addition ,  he  bought  a  sizable  stake  in  a  minor  league  baseball  team ,  and  took  a  second  job  at  Mr .  Wagner 's  corporate  law  firm .  Mr .  Kelly 's  bank ,  Spirit Bank ,  would  be  there  for  much  of  it  --  providing  financing  for  Mr .  Pruitt 's  Tulsa  home  and  his  stake  in  the  baseball  team ,  as  well  as  the  mortgage  for  the  Oklahoma  City  house .  Mr .  Pruitt 's  interactions  with  S BC  also  show  that  his  bl urring  of  lines  with  lobbyists  has  roots  in  his  Oklahoma  years .  One  of  the  issues  at  the  E .  P .  A .  that  has  gotten  Mr .  Pruitt  in  trouble  with  government  watch dogs  involved  his  renting  a  room  in  Washington  for  $  50  a  night  from  the  wife  of  an  energy  lobbyist  who  has  had  business  in  front  of  the  agency .  Lobby ists  and  others  in  Oklahoma  state  politics  who  encountered  Mr .  Pruitt  recalled  him  as  a  tough  competitor  who  always  had  his  eye  on  a  higher  office .  Some  called  him  a \"  Boy  Scout \"  who  was  sting y  with  his  money ,  while  others  said  privately  that  he  had  ex uded  a  sense  of  entitlement  --  that  rules  did  not  apply  to  him .  David  Walters ,  a  former  Oklahoma  governor  and  Democrat ,  described  Mr .  Pruitt  as  someone  who  looked  out  for  himself  over  the  needs  of  constituents ,  especially  during  his  years  as  attorney  general .\"  I  was  disappointed  to  find  him  operating  in  a  hyper partisan  manner  and  seemingly  representing  corporate  interests  over  Oklahoma  citizens ,\"  Mr .  Walters  said .  In  response  to  questions  submitted  by  The  New  York  Times  about  Mr .  Pruitt 's  finances  in  Oklahoma ,  an  E .  P .  A .  spokeswoman  said  Mr .  Pruitt 's  business  dealings  with  Mr .  Kelly  and  Mr .  Wagner \"  were  ethical \"  and  his  stake  in  the  shell  company \"  was  a  simple  real  estate  investment .\"\"  Mr .

Tr ams  hum  along  bou lev ards  lined  with  elegant  cafes  and  cl ogged  with  the  cars  German  companies  manufacture  here .  The  country  has  escaped  what  Milan  K under a ,  the  Czech  writer ,  called  the \"  kidnapped  West ,\"  the  great  swath  of  Europe  yielded  to  the  Soviet  empire  after  World  War  II ,  and  has  returned  to  the  Western  family .  Or  so  it  seems ,  until  you  notice  the  posters  of  a  smiling  Hungarian - American  Jew ,  his  arms  around  opposition  politicians  who  brand ish  wire - cut ters  and  have  cut  through  a  fence .  The  man  in  question  is  George  Soros ,  the  billionaire  investor  and  philanthrop ist .  He 's  not  on  any  ballot ,  but  his  international  renown  and  funding  of  liberal  causes  has  made  him  the  chosen  symbol ,  for  Prime  Minister  Viktor  Or ban  and  his  right - wing  F ides z  party ,  of  all  they  lo athe  :  international  spec ulators ,  sa ppers  of  nation  and  Christ end om ,  facilit ators  of  mass  migration .  As  a  young  man ,  Or ban  fought  against  Bolshe v ism .  Western  liberal  democracy  was  the  Prom ised  Land .  Now  it  has  morphed  into  the  enemy .  The  West  is  the  site  of  European  cultural  suicide ,  the  place  where  family ,  church ,  nation  and  traditional  notions  of  marriage  and  gender  go  to  die .\"  The  danger  is  threatening  us  from  the  West ,\"  Or ban ,  who  has  been  in  power  for  eight  years  and  is  seemingly  headed  for  re - election  Sunday ,  said  in  February .\"  This  danger  to  us  comes  from  politicians  in  Brussels ,  Berlin  and  Paris .\"  To  counter  it ,  the  Hungarian  prime  minister  has  established  a  template  :  Neutral ize  an  independent  judiciary .  Sub jug ate  much  of  the  media .  Demon ize  migrants .  Create  loyal  new  elites  through  cr ony  capitalism .  E nerg ize  a  national  narrative  of  victim hood  and  heroism  through  the  manipulation  of  historical  memory .  Claim  the \"  people 's  will \"  overr ides  constitutional  checks  and  balances .  And ,  lo ,  the  new  Prom ised  Land  :  competitive  authoritarian ism ,  a  form  of  European  single - party  rule  that  retains  a  v ene er  of  democracy  while  ske wing  the  contest  sufficiently  to  ensure  it  is  likely  to  yield  only  one  result .  There 's  no  totalitarian  secret  police .  Nobody  disappears  in  the  night .  Foreign  capital  is  welcome .  Hungary  is  not  unf ree  but  it 's  not  free  either .  It 's  the  new  semi - closed  hybrid  of  Or ban  and  Jar os law  K ac zynski ,  the  shadowy  leader  of  the  conservative  governing  Law  and  Justice  Party  in  Poland ,  both  of  whom  fought  as  youths  for  the  liberty  the  West  embodied .  [  To  read  more  about  the  threat  of  authoritarian ism  around  the  world ,  read  Made le ine  Al bright  on  Donald  Trump .]  Donald  Trump 's  election  was  part  of  a  worldwide  nationalist  and  aut ocratic  l urch .  A  vigorous  counter revolution  against  the  liberal - democratic  orthodoxy  of  diversity  and  multicultural ism  is  underway .  The  fact  that  Trump  reflects ,  and  reinforces ,  this  broad  movement ,  exactly  a  half - century  after  the  head y  flowering  of  every  liberty  in  1968 ,  suggests  he  will  be  much  harder  to  disl odge  than  many  liberals  imagine .  Or ban  was  the  first  European  leader  to  back  Trump  during  his  campaign  and  celebrated  his  victory  as  the  end  of \"  liberal  non - democracy .\"  Trump  called  Or ban \"  strong  and  brave \"  in  a  meeting  with  the  Hungarian  ambassador ,  according  to  the  Hungarian  magazine  Fig y elo .  The  European  nations  most  en am ored  of  freedom  --  those  released  three  decades  ago  from  the  w ithering  grip  of  the  Soviet  empire  --  have  transformed  into  those  most  skeptical  that  liberal  democracy  provides  it .  It 's  an  extraordinary  turn .  The  Brussels - based  European  Union  ( of  which  Hungary  has  been  a  member  and  financial  beneficiary  since  2004 )  and  Chancellor  Angela  Merkel  of  Germany  are  viewed  in  Hungary  with  greater  suspicion  than  Vladimir  Putin .  Poland ,  the  most  populous  Central  European  state ,  has  so  embraced  the  Hungarian  model  that  K ac zynski  calls  it  the \"  example .\"  The  Czech  Republic  may  not  be  far  behind .  Or ban ,  who  attended  Oxford  as  a  young  man  on  a  Soros - funded  scholarship ,  has  hailed \"  a  new  era \"  reflecting  a  popular  desire  for  democracies  that  are  not  open .  Adam  Bod nar ,  Poland 's  embattled  o mbudsman  in  Warsaw ,  suggested  to  me  that \"  Hungary  has  shown  there 's  no  need  to  introduce  a  typical  authoritarian  system .  You  can  control  what  happens  without  it .\"  One  of  the  politicians  embraced  by  Soros  in  the  election  posters  around  Budapest  is  Bern ad ett  S zel ,  a  co - leader  of  the  Green  Party .  She  told  me  she  has  never  met  Soros .  The  image  is  a  fake .  According  to  Laura  Sil ber ,  the  spokeswoman  for  Soros 's  Open  Society  Found ations ,  it  has  been \"  doct ored  to  make  Soros 's  nose  longer  --  right  out  of  the  Go eb b els  playbook .\"  S zel ,  who  is  trying  to  unite  Hungary 's  chronically  spl int ered  opposition  against  F ides z ,  said  Or ban \"  is  poisoning  Hungary  day  by  day .\"  A  member  of  the  Parliament 's  National  Security  Committee ,  she  faces  a  smear  campaign  from  F ides z  politicians  determined  to  oust  her .

The  searches  open  a  new  front  for  the  Justice  Department  in  its  scrutiny  of  Mr .  Trump  and  his  associates  :  His  longtime  lawyer  is  being  investigated  in  Manhattan  ;  his  son - in - law ,  Jared  Kushner ,  is  facing  scrutiny  by  prosecutors  in  Brooklyn  ;  his  former  campaign  chairman  is  under  indictment  ;  his  former  national  security  adviser  has  pleaded  guilty  to  lying  ;  and  a  pair  of  former  campaign  aides  are  cooperating  with  Mr .  Mueller .  Mr .  Mueller ,  meanwhile ,  wants  to  interview  Mr .  Trump  about  possible  obstruction  of  justice .  It  is  not  clear  what  Mr .  Mueller  saw  that  made  him  refer  the  matter  to  other  prosecutors .  But  the  searches  show  that  Mr . <COMMENT_LEN_1_AUTHOR>...\n",

      "source text = AC RAM ENT O  --  As  the  California  sun  burned  away  the  haze  on  Easter  Eve ,  a  few  hundred  people  gathered  at  yet  another  rally  for  Step hon  Clark  at  the  pictures que  C esar  E .  Chavez  Plaza  across  from  City  Hall .  Clark  is  the  unarmed  black  man ,  a  young  father  of  two  boys ,  who  was  shot  to  death  two  weeks  ago  in  his  grandmother 's  backyard .  The  police  were  investigating  a  vandalism  complaint  when  they  encountered  Clark ,  firing  20  shots  at  him .  According  to  an  independent  autopsy  commissioned  by  Clark 's  family ,  eight  of  the  bullets  found  their  mark ,  six  of  them  entering  his  body  through  his  back .  No  weapon  was  found  on  Clark  --  only  his  cellphone .  People  showed  up  with  plac ards  and  optimism  for  change  and  justice ,  but  dogged  by  the  shadow  of  other  such  shootings  where  legal  accountability  has  been  thwarted .  I  try  to  come  to  each  of  these  moments  with  a  fresh  perspective ,  but  I  am  undermined  and  betrayed  by  having  covered  too  many  of  them .  I  can 't  escape  the  reality  that  there  is  a  ritual ization  of  these  tra um as  in  which  the  shootings  serve  as  cataly sts ,  a  l ancing  of  the  boil ,  in  which  decades  of  oppression ,  neglect ,  desperation  and  hopeless ness  finds  a  vent ing  valve .  And  what  starts  as  white - hot  rage  slowly  cool s  into  a  disp assion ate  disappointment  in  a  system  that ,  it  is  revealed ,  is  operating  as  designed .  Each  protest  is  undoubtedly  about  the  case  at  hand ,  but  collectively  they  are  also  about  communities  that  feel  abused  and  betrayed  in  a  country  that  sees  them  as  expend able .  It  is  not  a \"  local  matter ,\"  as  the  White  House  suggested  last  week ,  but  a  national  disgrace .  Eff orts  at  policy  reform  --  better  training ,  utilization  of  body  cameras  ( which  the  officers  in  Clark 's  case  suspicious ly  muted  after  shooting  him ),  changes  in  rules  of  pursuit  --  can  have  an  effect ,  but  they  can 't  fully  remedy  this  problem .  These  shootings  keep  happening  and  officers  are  rarely  charged  with  crimes  --  and  even  more  rarely  convicted  --  because  what  they  are  doing  is  legal .  That  is  the  true  American  tragedy .  In  the  1989  case  of  Graham  v .  Connor ,  the  Supreme  Court  ruled  that  the  Fourth  Amendment 's \"  objective  reason abl eness \"  standard  over ro de  the  amendment 's  protections \"  against  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures \"  and  even  the  Fifth  Amendment 's  admon ition  that  no  person  shall \"  be  deprived  of  life ,  liberty ,  or  property ,  without  due  process  of  law .\"  By  ruling  that  an  officer 's  use  of  force  must  only  meet  the \"  objectively  reasonable \"  standard  while  allowing  that \"  police  officers  are  often  forced  to  make  split - second  judgments  --  in  circumstances  that  are  tense ,  uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving  --  about  the  amount  of  force  that  is  necessary  in  a  particular  situation ,\"  the  court  itself  laid  the  groundwork  for  the  extra judicial  killings  by  police  officers  that  we  keep  seeing .  This  ruling  has  become  scripture  for  law  enforcement .  As  Police  Magazine  wrote  in  2014  : \"  A  generation  of  officers  has  been  trained  in  the  case 's  practical  meaning  and  has  spent  decades  applying  it  to  every  use - of - force  decision .  So  it  has  become  part  of  law  enforcement  DNA ,  often  unnoticed  as  it  works  in  the  background  to  determine  our  actions .\"  What  is \"  objectively  reasonable \"  is  clearly  a  subjective  determination ,  and  when  the  assessment  interacts  with  race ,  class ,  gender  and  the  stereotypical  perception  of  criminality  and  propensity  for  violence  surrounding  those  class ifications ,  the \"  objectively  reasonable \"  standard  can  easily  become  corrupted  and  used  more  as  a  badge  of  permission  and  a  shield  against  liability .

      "source text = AC RAM ENT O  --  As  the  California  sun  burned  away  the  haze  on  Easter  Eve ,  a  few  hundred  people  gathered  at  yet  another  rally  for  Step hon  Clark  at  the  pictures que  C esar  E .  Chavez  Plaza  across  from  City  Hall .  Clark  is  the  unarmed  black  man ,  a  young  father  of  two  boys ,  who  was  shot  to  death  two  weeks  ago  in  his  grandmother 's  backyard .  The  police  were  investigating  a  vandalism  complaint  when  they  encountered  Clark ,  firing  20  shots  at  him .  According  to  an  independent  autopsy  commissioned  by  Clark 's  family ,  eight  of  the  bullets  found  their  mark ,  six  of  them  entering  his  body  through  his  back .  No  weapon  was  found  on  Clark  --  only  his  cellphone .  People  showed  up  with  plac ards  and  optimism  for  change  and  justice ,  but  dogged  by  the  shadow  of  other  such  shootings  where  legal  accountability  has  been  thwarted .  I  try  to  come  to  each  of  these  moments  with  a  fresh  perspective ,  but  I  am  undermined  and  betrayed  by  having  covered  too  many  of  them .  I  can 't  escape  the  reality  that  there  is  a  ritual ization  of  these  tra um as  in  which  the  shootings  serve  as  cataly sts ,  a  l ancing  of  the  boil ,  in  which  decades  of  oppression ,  neglect ,  desperation  and  hopeless ness  finds  a  vent ing  valve .  And  what  starts  as  white - hot  rage  slowly  cool s  into  a  disp assion ate  disappointment  in  a  system  that ,  it  is  revealed ,  is  operating  as  designed .  Each  protest  is  undoubtedly  about  the  case  at  hand ,  but  collectively  they  are  also  about  communities  that  feel  abused  and  betrayed  in  a  country  that  sees  them  as  expend able .  It  is  not  a \"  local  matter ,\"  as  the  White  House  suggested  last  week ,  but  a  national  disgrace .  Eff orts  at  policy  reform  --  better  training ,  utilization  of  body  cameras  ( which  the  officers  in  Clark 's  case  suspicious ly  muted  after  shooting  him ),  changes  in  rules  of  pursuit  --  can  have  an  effect ,  but  they  can 't  fully  remedy  this  problem .  These  shootings  keep  happening  and  officers  are  rarely  charged  with  crimes  --  and  even  more  rarely  convicted  --  because  what  they  are  doing  is  legal .  That  is  the  true  American  tragedy .  In  the  1989  case  of  Graham  v .  Connor ,  the  Supreme  Court  ruled  that  the  Fourth  Amendment 's \"  objective  reason abl eness \"  standard  over ro de  the  amendment 's  protections \"  against  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures \"  and  even  the  Fifth  Amendment 's  admon ition  that  no  person  shall \"  be  deprived  of  life ,  liberty ,  or  property ,  without  due  process  of  law .\"  By  ruling  that  an  officer 's  use  of  force  must  only  meet  the \"  objectively  reasonable \"  standard  while  allowing  that \"  police  officers  are  often  forced  to  make  split - second  judgments  --  in  circumstances  that  are  tense ,  uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving  --  about  the  amount  of  force  that  is  necessary  in  a  particular  situation ,\"  the  court  itself  laid  the  groundwork  for  the  extra judicial  killings  by  police  officers  that  we  keep  seeing .  This  ruling  has  become  scripture  for  law  enforcement .  As  Police  Magazine  wrote  in  2014  : \"  A  generation  of  officers  has  been  trained  in  the  case 's  practical  meaning  and  has  spent  decades  applying  it  to  every  use - of - force  decision .

What  would  make  your  life ,  as  the  city ,  work  better ?\" '  Mr .  de  Blasio  said  in  a  recent  television  interview  that  people  close  to  him  said  captured  his  frustration .\"  A  lot  of  politics ,  a  lot  of  post uring ,  a  lot  of  interference ,  a  lot  of  red  tape ,  that 's  what  I  get .\"  The  cont ours  of  the  feud ,  and  its  effects ,  have  been  puzzled  over  for  years  :  Why  would  two  men ,  whose  stated  goals  often  run  on  similar  tracks ,  allow  their  on etime  friendship  -- \"  in  the  deepest  sense  of  the  word \"  as  Mr .  Cuomo  once  put  it  --  to  deterior ate  into  pure  det estation ?  This  portrait  of  a  relationship  fractured  is  based  on  interviews  with  more  than  two  dozen  past  and  present  aides ,  advisers  and  officials  who  have  worked  with  Mr .  Cuomo  and  Mr .  de  Blasio  over  the  last  two  decades .  Many  spoke  on  condition  of  anonymity  for  fear  of  repr is als  from  either  camp .  Mr .  Cuomo  and  Mr .  de  Blasio  both  declined  to  speak  on  the  record .  In  their  own  way ,  Mr .  Cuomo  and  Mr .  de  Blasio  both  are  vying  to  define  the  Democratic  Party 's  future  in  New  York  and  beyond  :  the  mayor  as  a  progressive  beacon  for  un rep ent ant  liberalism  succeeding ,  the  governor  as  a  deal - cutting  Democrat  who  can  actually  make  good  on  progressive  promises .\"  I  believe  in  action .  I  believe  in  results .  I  believe  in  making  a  difference  in  people 's  lives ,\"  Mr .  Cuomo  said  this  year  when  asked  about  the  mayor .\"  I  don 't  believe  it 's  about  giving  speeches  about  values .\"  But  the  comp ulsive  rivalry  makes  both  look  small .\"  All  rules  of  political  decor um  are  out  the  window  with  these  two ,\"  said  Andrew  K irt zman ,  a  New  York  communications  strategist .\"  The  Cuomo  people  genuinely  feel  that  de  Blasio  is  incompetent  and  the  de  Blasio  people  genuinely  feel  that  Cuomo  is  per n icious .\"  Things  have  only  worsened  with  the  candidacy  of  Cynthia  Nixon ,  the  actress ,  education  advocate  and  friend  of  Mr .  de  Blasio  who  is  challenging  the  governor  in  the  Democratic  primary .  Mr .  Cuomo  has  se et hed  about  what  he  believes  is  Mr .  de  Blasio 's  hidden  hand  in  her  run ,  and  has  signaled  to  allies  that  he  intends  to  punish  the  mayor  for  it ,  even  against  the  counsel  of  his  advisers .  The  latest  flash  point  :  the  recent  state  budget  that  served  as  a  c ud gel  to  exert  his  dominance  over  Mr .  de  Blasio .  He  added  new  oversight  to  the  city 's  mayor - run  school  system .  He  forced  the  mayor  to  hand  over  $  418  million  for  subway  repairs ,  threatening  to  garn ish  property  taxes  if  Mr .  de  Blasio  resisted .  He  gave  $  250  million  to  the  city 's  be league red  public  housing  system  --  but  then  declared  a  state  of  emergency  and  ordered  an  independent  monitor .  On  the  Monday  after  the  state  budget  passed ,  Mr .  Cuomo  held  a  triumphant  event  with  the  city 's  top  elected  leaders  to  celebrate  the  new  funding  and  sign  the  order .  Mr .  de  Blasio  was  pointed ly  not  invited .  And  when  the  mayor  found  out ,  he  pressed  at  least  one  elected  official  not  to  attend ,  according  to  three  people  familiar  with  the  efforts .  Later  that  week ,  at  almost  the  exact  moment  that  Mr .  Cuomo  was  in  a <COMMENT_LEN_0_AUTHOR>...\n",

The  courtroom  battle  over  what  to  do  with  the  seized  material  came  one  week  after  federal  agents ,  in  an  extraordinary  move ,  descended  on  Mr .  Cohen 's  properties  and  walked  away  with  10  boxes  of  documents  and  as  many  as  a  dozen  electronic  devices ,  including  cell phones  and  computer  hard  drives .  Lawyers  for  Mr .  Trump  and  Mr .  Cohen ,  and  prosecutors  with  the  United  States  attorney 's  office  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York ,  had  asked  Judge  Wood  for  the  right  to  look  at  the  documents  in  order  to  determine  which  among  them  might  be  protected  by  attorney - client  privilege .  That  step  is  important  because  it  could  affect  which  documents  prosecutors  can  ultimately  use  in  the  investigation .  In  the  aftermath  of  the  raid ,  people  in  the  Trump  administration  said  they  saw  the  Cohen  inquiry  as  a  more  serious  threat  to  Mr .  Trump  than  the  investigation  by  the  special  counsel ,  Robert  S .  Mueller  III .

The  seized  documents  could  shed  light  on  the  president 's  relationship  with  a  lawyer  who  has  helped  navigate  some  of  Mr .

      "source text =  the  imposition  of  unprecedented  sanctions  against  Russia  by  the  Trump  administration  and  Congress  over  the  past  year ,  President  Vladimir  Putin  only  seems  more  intent  on  causing  griev ous  harm  to  international  peace  and  stability .  Along side  increased  financial  sanctions  against  Mr .  Putin  and  his  cr onies ,  there  is  another  arrow  in  the  American  qu iver  that  would  add  diplomatic  pressure  against  Russia  :  The  State  Department  should  consider  adding  the  country  to  its  list  of  state  sponsors  of  terrorism ,  alongside  its  close  allies  Iran  and  Syria .  The  moral  case  for  such  a  designation  is  sound .  Russia  has  invaded  its  neighbors  Georgia  and  Ukraine ,  it  supports  the  murderous  regime  of  Bashar  al - Assad  and  our  enemies  in  Afghanistan ,  and  it  is  engaged  in  active  information  warfare  against  Western  democracies ,  including  meddling  in  the  2016  United  States  elections .  This  week ,  the  Organization  for  Prevention  of  Chemical  Weapons  announced  that  the  Kremlin  had  crossed  yet  another  previously  unimaginable  line ,  when  it  confirmed  findings  by  the  British  government  that  a  Russian  military - grade  nerve  agent ,  which  British  authorities  identified  as  Nov ich ok ,  was  used  to  poison  a  former  Russian  intelligence  agent ,  Sergei  Sk rip al ,  and  his  daughter  in  the  English  city  of  Sal isbury .  The  attack  also  resulted  in  the  hospital ization  of  British  law  enforcement  officials  who  responded  to  the  scene ,  as  well  as  bystanders .  Russia  has  denied  the  charges ,  but  the  evidence  is  overwhelming .  So  is  the  attack  � �  s  significance  :  Russia  is  now  officially  responsible  for  a  chemical  weapons  attack  against  a  NATO  member  state  on  its  own  soil  —  a  brazen  violation  of  sovereignty  of  our  closest  ally .  It  requires  a  serious  American  response .  This  startling  confirmation  comes  on  the  heels  of  horrendous  chemical  weapons  attacks  by  Mr .  Assad  against  his  own  people  in  Syria .  He  is  in  power  only  because  the  Kremlin  provides  him  with  extensive  diplomatic ,  military  and  economic  support .  The  use  of  chemical  weapons  against  civilians  is  illegal  under  international  law ,  particularly  the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention .  In  fact ,  Syria  � �  s  illicit  chemical  program  is  part  of  the  reason  the  United  States  continues  to  designate  Syria  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism .  There  is  also  evidence  that  Russia  is  playing  both  sides  of  the  conflict  in  Syria  —  defending  the  murderous  Assad  regime ,  but  also  fueling  the  radical  insurgency  against  it .  Reporting  by  Ukrainian  news  outlets  has  shown  that  Russia  has  provided  material  support  to  the  Islamic  State ,  including  assistance  in  recruitment .  According  to  these  reports ,  the  Islamic  State  now  counts  thousands  of  Russian - speaking  jihad is  among  its  forces .  We  also  know  that  Russia  is  ramp ing  up  its  support  for  anti - American  insurgents  in  Afghanistan .  On  Feb .  9 ,  2017 ,  Gen .  John  Nicholson ,  the  American  commander  in  Afghanistan ,  told  the  Senate  Armed  Services  Committee  that  Russia  has  � �  begun  to  publicly  legitim ize  the  Taliban  � �  as  a  means  � �  to  undermine  the  United  States  and  NATO . � �  Moreover ,  Russia  � �  s  illegal  and  immoral  war  against  Ukraine  shows  no  signs  of  ending .  Since  Russia  � �  s  annexation  of  Crimea  in  2014  and  subsequent  support  for  Russian - controlled  proxies  in  the  Don bas  region ,  the  international  community  has  failed  to  adequately  respond  to  continued  Russian  aggression  —  and  there  has  been  a  devastating  price  to  pay .  More  than  10 ,  000  Ukrainians  have  died  in  the  war  and  more  than  1 .  7  million  have  been  displaced .  On  July  17 ,  2014 ,  Russian  proxies  shot  down  a  civilian  airliner ,  killing  all  298  onboard  —  including  an  American .  This  is  why  I  plan  to  introduce  legislation  that  would  require  the  State  Department  to  determine  within  90  days  whether  the  Russian  Federation  meets  the  criteria  to  be  designated  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism .  If  the  answer  is  yes ,  Russia  would  face  restrictions  on  American  foreign  assistance ,  a  ban  on  American  defense  exports  and  sales ,  limits  on  American  sales  of  certain  items  that  have  both  civilian  and  military  uses ,  and  other  financial  and  other  restrictions .  Many  of  these  penalties  are  already  required  under  the  Counter ing  America  � �  s  Ad vers aries  Through  San ctions  Act ,  and  the  Trump  administration  is  contemplating  others .  Some  will  argue  that  applying  such  a  toxic  label  to  a  major  global  power ,  one  with  a  permanent  seat  at  the  United  Nations  Security  Council ,  will  not  get  it  to  back  down ,  and  might  even  further  damage  American - Russia  ties ,  already  at  an  all - time  low .  Those  are  important  policy  questions ,  which  is  why  my  legislation  leaves  a  final  determination  to  the  professionals  at  the  State  Department .  However ,  it  is  clear  that  the  blame  for  today  � �  s  distrust  and  tensions  between  Moscow  and  Washington  lies  entirely  with  the  Kremlin  and  its  atro cious  behavior .  We  must  take  every  diplomatic  step  necessary  to  protect  our  allies  and  our  democracy ,  and  to  deter  a  rev anch ist  Russia  that  is  intent  on  rewriting  history  and  threatening  our  way  of  life .

      "source text =  the  imposition  of  unprecedented  sanctions  against  Russia  by  the  Trump  administration  and  Congress  over  the  past  year ,  President  Vladimir  Putin  only  seems  more  intent  on  causing  griev ous  harm  to  international  peace  and  stability .  Along side  increased  financial  sanctions  against  Mr .  Putin  and  his  cr onies ,  there  is  another  arrow  in  the  American  qu iver  that  would  add  diplomatic  pressure  against  Russia  :  The  State  Department  should  consider  adding  the  country  to  its  list  of  state  sponsors  of  terrorism ,  alongside  its  close  allies  Iran  and  Syria .  The  moral  case  for  such  a  designation  is  sound .  Russia  has  invaded  its  neighbors  Georgia  and  Ukraine ,  it  supports  the  murderous  regime  of  Bashar  al - Assad  and  our  enemies  in  Afghanistan ,  and  it  is  engaged  in  active  information  warfare  against  Western  democracies ,  including  meddling  in  the  2016  United  States  elections .  This  week ,  the  Organization  for  Prevention  of  Chemical  Weapons  announced  that  the  Kremlin  had  crossed  yet  another  previously  unimaginable  line ,  when  it  confirmed  findings  by  the  British  government  that  a  Russian  military - grade  nerve  agent ,  which  British  authorities  identified  as  Nov ich ok ,  was  used  to  poison  a  former  Russian  intelligence  agent ,  Sergei  Sk rip al ,  and  his  daughter  in  the  English  city  of  Sal isbury .  The  attack  also  resulted  in  the  hospital ization  of  British  law  enforcement  officials  who  responded  to  the  scene ,  as  well  as  bystanders .  Russia  has  denied  the  charges ,  but  the  evidence  is  overwhelming .  So  is  the  attack  � �  s  significance  :  Russia  is  now  officially  responsible  for  a  chemical  weapons  attack  against  a  NATO  member  state  on  its  own  soil  —  a  brazen  violation  of  sovereignty  of  our  closest  ally .  It  requires  a  serious  American  response .  This  startling  confirmation  comes  on  the  heels  of  horrendous  chemical  weapons  attacks  by  Mr .  Assad  against  his  own  people  in  Syria .  He  is  in  power  only  because  the  Kremlin  provides  him  with  extensive  diplomatic ,  military  and  economic  support .  The  use  of  chemical  weapons  against  civilians  is  illegal  under  international  law ,  particularly  the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention .  In  fact ,  Syria  � �  s  illicit  chemical  program  is  part  of  the  reason  the  United  States  continues  to  designate  Syria  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism .  There  is  also  evidence  that  Russia  is  playing  both  sides  of  the  conflict  in  Syria  —  defending  the  murderous  Assad  regime ,  but  also  fueling  the  radical  insurgency  against  it .  Reporting  by  Ukrainian  news  outlets  has  shown  that  Russia  has  provided  material  support  to  the  Islamic  State ,  including  assistance  in  recruitment .  According  to  these  reports ,  the  Islamic  State  now  counts  thousands  of  Russian - speaking  jihad is  among  its  forces .  We  also  know  that  Russia  is  ramp ing  up  its  support  for  anti - American  insurgents  in  Afghanistan .  On  Feb .  9 ,  2017 ,  Gen .  John  Nicholson ,  the  American  commander  in  Afghanistan ,  told  the  Senate  Armed  Services  Committee  that  Russia  has  � �  begun  to  publicly  legitim ize  the  Taliban  � �  as  a  means  � �  to  undermine  the  United  States  and  NATO . � �  Moreover ,  Russia  � �  s  illegal  and  immoral  war  against  Ukraine  shows  no  signs  of  ending .  Since  Russia  � �  s  annexation  of  Crimea  in  2014  and  subsequent  support  for  Russian - controlled  proxies  in  the  Don bas  region ,  the  international  community  has  failed  to  adequately  respond  to  continued  Russian  aggression  —  and  there  has  been  a  devastating  price  to  pay .  More  than  10 ,  000  Ukrainians  have  died  in  the  war  and  more  than  1 .  7  million  have  been  displaced .  On  July  17 ,  2014 ,  Russian  proxies  shot  down  a  civilian  airliner ,  killing  all  298  onboard  —  including  an  American .  This  is  why  I  plan  to  introduce  legislation  that  would  require  the  State  Department  to  determine  within  90  days  whether  the  Russian  Federation  meets  the  criteria  to  be  designated  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism .  If  the  answer  is  yes ,  Russia  would  face  restrictions  on  American  foreign  assistance ,  a  ban  on  American  defense  exports  and  sales ,  limits  on  American  sales  of  certain  items  that  have  both  civilian  and  military  uses ,  and  other  financial  and  other  restrictions .  Many  of  these  penalties  are  already  required  under  the  Counter ing  America  � �  s  Ad vers aries  Through  San ctions  Act ,  and  the  Trump  administration  is  contemplating  others .  Some  will  argue  that  applying  such  a  toxic  label  to  a  major  global  power ,  one  with  a  permanent  seat  at  the  United  Nations  Security  Council ,  will  not  get  it  to  back  down ,  and  might  even  further  damage  American - Russia  ties ,  already  at  an  all - time  low .  Those  are  important  policy  questions ,  which  is  why  my  legislation  leaves  a  final  determination  to  the  professionals  at  the  State  Department .  However ,  it  is  clear  that  the  blame  for  today  � �  s  distrust  and  tensions  between  Moscow  and  Washington  lies  entirely  with  the  Kremlin  and  its  atro cious  behavior .  We  must  take  every  diplomatic  step  necessary  to  protect  our  allies  and  our  democracy ,  and  to  deter  a  rev anch ist  Russia  that  is  intent  on  rewriting  history  and  threatening  our  way  of  life .

Putin  and  his  cr onies ,  there  is  another  arrow  in  the  American  qu iver  that  would  add  diplomatic  pressure  against  Russia  :  The  State  Department  should  consider  adding  the  country  to  its  list  of  state  sponsors  of  terrorism ,  alongside  its  close  allies  Iran  and  Syria .  The  moral  case  for  such  a  designation  is  sound .  Russia  has  invaded  its  neighbors  Georgia  and  Ukraine ,  it  supports  the  murderous  regime  of  Bashar  al - Assad  and  our  enemies  in  Afghanistan ,  and  it  is  engaged  in  active  information  warfare  against  Western  democracies ,  including  meddling  in  the  2016  United  States  elections .  This  week ,  the  Organization  for  Prevention  of  Chemical  Weapons  announced  that  the  Kremlin  had  crossed  yet  another  previously  unimaginable  line ,  when  it  confirmed  findings  by  the  British  government  that  a  Russian  military - grade  nerve  agent ,  which  British  authorities  identified  as  Nov ich ok ,  was  used  to  poison  a  former  Russian  intelligence  agent ,  Sergei  Sk rip al ,  and  his  daughter  in  the  English  city  of  Sal isbury .  The  attack  also  resulted  in  the  hospital ization  of  British  law  enforcement  officials  who  responded  to  the  scene ,  as  well  as  bystanders .  Russia  has  denied  the  charges ,  but  the  evidence  is  overwhelming .  So  is  the  attack  � �  s  significance  :  Russia  is  now  officially  responsible  for  a  chemical  weapons  attack  against  a  NATO  member  state  on  its  own  soil  —  a  brazen  violation  of  sovereignty  of  our  closest  ally .  It  requires  a  serious  American  response .  This  startling  confirmation  comes  on  the  heels  of  horrendous  chemical  weapons  attacks  by  Mr .  Assad  against  his  own  people  in  Syria .  He  is  in  power  only  because  the  Kremlin  provides  him  with  extensive  diplomatic ,  military  and  economic  support .  The  use  of  chemical  weapons  against  civilians  is  illegal  under  international  law ,  particularly  the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention .  In  fact ,  Syria  � �  s  illicit  chemical  program  is  part  of  the  reason  the  United  States  continues  to  designate  Syria  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism .  There  is  also  evidence  that  Russia  is  playing  both  sides  of  the  conflict  in  Syria  —  defending  the  murderous  Assad  regime ,  but  also  fueling  the  radical  insurgency  against  it .  Reporting  by  Ukrainian  news  outlets  has  shown  that  Russia  has  provided  material  support  to  the  Islamic  State ,  including  assistance  in  recruitment .  According  to  these  reports ,  the  Islamic  State  now  counts  thousands  of  Russian - speaking  jihad is  among  its  forces .  We  also  know  that  Russia  is  ramp ing  up  its  support  for  anti - American  insurgents  in  Afghanistan .  On  Feb .  9 ,  2017 ,  Gen .  John  Nicholson ,  the  American  commander  in  Afghanistan ,  told  the  Senate  Armed  Services  Committee  that  Russia  has  � �  begun  to  publicly  legitim ize  the  Taliban  � �  as  a  means  � �  to  undermine  the  United  States  and  NATO . � �  Moreover ,  Russia  � �  s  illegal  and  immoral  war  against  Ukraine  shows  no  signs  of  ending .  Since  Russia  � �  s  annexation  of  Crimea  in  2014  and  subsequent  support  for  Russian - controlled  proxies  in  the  Don bas  region ,  the  international  community  has  failed  to  adequately  respond  to  continued  Russian  aggression  —  and  there  has  been  a  devastating  price  to  pay .  More  than  10 ,  000  Ukrainians  have  died  in  the  war  and  more  than  1 .  7  million  have  been  displaced .  On  July  17 ,  2014 ,  Russian  proxies  shot  down  a  civilian  airliner ,  killing  all  298  onboard  —  including  an  American .  This  is  why  I  plan  to  introduce  legislation  that  would  require  the  State  Department  to  determine  within  90  days  whether  the  Russian  Federation  meets  the  criteria  to  be  designated  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism .  If  the  answer  is  yes ,  Russia  would  face  restrictions  on  American  foreign  assistance ,  a  ban  on  American  defense  exports  and  sales ,  limits  on  American  sales  of  certain  items  that  have  both  civilian  and  military  uses ,  and  other  financial  and  other  restrictions .  Many  of  these  penalties  are  already  required  under  the  Counter ing  America  � �  s  Ad vers aries  Through  San ctions  Act ,  and  the  Trump  administration  is  contemplating  others .  Some  will  argue  that  applying  such  a  toxic  label  to  a  major  global  power ,  one  with  a  permanent  seat  at  the  United  Nations  Security  Council ,  will  not  get  it  to  back  down ,  and  might  even  further  damage  American - Russia  ties ,  already  at  an  all - time  low .  Those  are  important  policy  questions ,  which  is  why  my  legislation  leaves  a  final  determination  to  the  professionals  at  the  State  Department .  However ,  it  is  clear  that  the  blame  for  today  � �  s  distrust  and  tensions  between  Moscow  and  Washington  lies  entirely  with  the  Kremlin  and  its  atro cious  behavior .  We  must  take  every  diplomatic  step  necessary  to  protect  our  allies  and  our  democracy ,  and  to  deter  a  rev anch ist  Russia  that  is  intent  on  rewriting  history  and  threatening  our  way  of  life .

      "source text =  --  The  F .  B .  I .  raided  the  Rockefeller  Center  office  and  Park  Avenue  hotel  room  of  President  Trump 's  longtime  personal  lawyer ,  Michael  D .  Cohen ,  on  Monday  morning ,  seizing  business  records ,  emails  and  documents  related  to  several  topics ,  including  a  payment  to  a  pornographic  film  actress .  Mr .  Trump ,  in  an  extraordinarily  angry  response ,  lashed  out  hours  later  at  what  a  person  briefed  on  the  matter  said  was  an  investigation  into  possible  bank  fraud  by  Mr .  Cohen .  Mr .  Trump  accused  his  own  Justice  Department  of  perpet rating  a \"  witch  hunt \"  and  asserted  that  the  F .  B .  I .\"  broke  in  to \"  Mr .  Cohen 's  office .  The  president ,  who  spoke  at  the  White  House  before  meeting  with  senior  military  commanders  about  a  potential  missile  strike  on  Syria ,  called  the  F .  B .  I .  raid  a \"  disgrace ful  situation \"  and  an \"  attack  on  our  country  in  a  true  sense .\"  It  is  not  clear  how  the  F .  B .  I .  entered  Mr .  Cohen 's  office ,  but  agents  had  a  search  warrant  and  typically  would  have  presented  it  to  office  personnel  to  be  let  in .  The  documents  identified  in  the  warrant  date  back  years ,  according  to  a  person  briefed  on  the  search .  The  prosecutors  obtained  the  search  warrant  after  receiving  a  referral  from  the  special  counsel  in  the  Russia  investigation ,  Robert  S .  Mueller  III ,  according  to  Mr .  Cohen 's  lawyer ,  who  called  the  search \"  completely  inappropriate  and  unnecessary .\"  The  search  does  not  appear  to  be  directly  related  to  Mr .  Mueller 's  investigation ,  but  most  likely  resulted  from  information  that  he  had  uncovered  and  gave  to  prosecutors  in  New  York .  In  his  tir ade  against  the  F .  B .  I .,  Mr .  Trump  m used  about  the  possibility  that  he  might  soon  fire  Mr .  Mueller .  Last  June ,  the  president  v ented  internally  about  wanting  to  fire  Mr .  Mueller ,  but  was  talked  out  of  it .\"  We 'll  see  what  may  happen ,\"  Mr .  Trump  said  Monday .\"  Many  people  have  said  you  should  fire  him .\"  The  president  once  again  r ailed  against  Jeff  Sessions ,  the  attorney  general ,  for  rec using  himself  in  the  Russia  inquiry ,  and  blasted  the  F .  B .  I .  for  failing  to  investigate  Hillary  Clinton ,\"  where  there  are  crimes .\"  He  criticized  Rod  J .  Rosenstein ,  the  deputy  attorney  general ,  who  is  overseeing  the  Russia  investigation ,  and  called  Mr .  Mueller 's  team \"  the  most  biased  group  of  people ,\"  who  he  said  were  mostly  Democrats  and  some  Republicans  who  had  worked  for  President  Barack  Obama .\"  That  is  really  now  on  a  whole  new  level  of  unfair ness ,\"  Mr .  Trump  said .  Mr .  Cohen 's  lawyer ,  Stephen  Ryan ,  confirmed  the  raids .\"  Today ,  the  U .  S .  attorney 's  office  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York  executed  a  series  of  search  warrants  and  seized  the  privileged  communications  between  my  client ,  Michael  Cohen ,  and  his  clients ,\"  Mr .  Ryan  said .\"  I  have  been  advised  by  federal  prosecutors  that  the  New  York  action  is ,  in  part ,  a  referral  by  the  office  of  special  counsel ,  Robert  Mueller .\"  Mr .  Sessions  appointed  the  United  States  attorney  for  the  Southern  District ,  Geoffrey  S .  Berman ,  only  in  January .  Mr .  Berman  is  a  former  law  partner  of  Rudolph  W .  Giuliani ,  a  former  New  York  mayor  and  a  supporter  of  Mr .  Trump .  The  payment  to  the  pornographic  film  actress ,  Stephanie  Clifford ,  who  is  known  as  Storm y  Daniels ,  is  only  one  of  many  topics  being  investigated ,  according  to  a  person  briefed  on  the  search .  The  F .  B .  I .  also  seized  emails ,  tax  documents  and  business  records ,  the  person  said .  Agents  raided  space  Mr .  Cohen  uses  in  the  Rockefeller  Center  office  of  the  law  firm  Squ ire  Patton  B ogg s ,  as  well  as  a  room  Mr .  Cohen  is  staying  in  at  the  Lo ews  Reg ency  Hotel  on  Park  Avenue  while  his  apartment  is  under  renovation ,  the  person  said .  [  Read  our  February  2018  profile  of  Michael  D .  Cohen  ]  To  obtain  a  search  warrant ,  prosecutors  must  convince  a  federal  judge  that  agents  are  likely  to  discover  evidence  of  criminal  activity .  The  searches  are  a  significant  intrusion  by  prosecutors  into  the  dealings  of  one  of  Mr .  Trump 's  closest  confid ants ,  and  they  pose  a  dilemma  for  Mr .  Trump .  He  has  dismissed  Mr .  Mueller 's  investigation  as  a \"  witch  hunt ,\"  but  these  warrants  were  obtained  by  an  unrelated  group  of  prosecutors .  The  searches  required  prior  consultation  with  senior  members  of  Mr .  Trump 's  own  Justice  Department .  Mr .  Trump  and  Mr .  Cohen ,  however ,  regarded  the  searches  as  an  effort  by  Mr .  Mueller  to  use  New  York 's  prosecutors  as  his  proxy ,  according  to  two  people  close  to  the  men .  The  searches  open  a  new  front  for  the  Justice  Department  in  its  scrutiny  of  Mr .  Trump  and  his  associates  :  His  longtime  lawyer  is  being  investigated  in  Manhattan  ;  his  son - in - law ,  Jared  Kushner ,  is  facing  scrutiny  by  prosecutors  in  Brooklyn  ;  his  former  campaign  chairman  is  under  indictment  ;  his  former  national  security  adviser  has  pleaded  guilty  to  lying  ;  and  a  pair  of  former  campaign  aides  are  cooperating  with  Mr .  Mueller .  Mr .  Mueller ,  meanwhile ,  wants  to  interview  Mr .  Trump  about  possible  obstruction  of  justice .  It  is  not  clear  what  Mr .  Mueller  saw  that  made  him  refer  the  matter  to  other  prosecutors .  But  the  searches  show  that  Mr . <US_AUTHOR>...\n",
