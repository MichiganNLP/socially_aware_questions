       "41938  Around this time of year last year, my mom and two sisters moved to texas. Long story short, the stay was progressively getting worse.We stay with our great aunt and she doesn't make things very enjoyable. Because of her attitude and the things she says to our face but how she switches over the phone, we distance ourselves from her.On monday, she sent out a text saying that there are no babies in the house and that we need to fend for ourselves. But just yesterday, she said she would punish for a month because the siblings and I are not responding to her texts where no appropriate response can be given or one isn't needed. If we aren't babies, why do you have to punish us as if we are some?Our mom is trying to work to get a place of her own, but her being a single mom and having to deal with the three of us is hard.That example up there with my aunt is just the start.

Was the only place I could afford. Been here for two weeks and am being asked to move out at the end of the minth because they randomly decided they were going to move. Should I ask for my money back that I paid as rent at the beginning of the month or would that be too out of line?   \n",

A mouse has died in the wall of a cupboard and cannot be removed. The smell is awful and it’s very close to food products. We’ve tried using special odour neutralising sachets but they’ve done nothing and only provided another bad smell.  What sort of things can we do in this situation? We keep the cupboard door open as much as we can to aerate the area but I’m concerned it’s going to take a while for the mouse to fully decompose. Would love any advice as this is a very unpleasant smell. Thanks,Kikko    \n",

They kept saying stuff along the lines of “if you don’t graduate all you’ll be able to do is flip burgers”. My mom also said later to my dad “ He’s too smart to do that” as if me being smart makes me want to be a genius or sit an office programming all day. They want me to go to college and waste my time doing stuff I don’t want to spend my life doing. What do I do? Am I wrong? What do I tell my parents to convince them?   \n",
       "27053  19 Male6' 2\"152 lbsWhiteSo back on May 11 I started to feel off. Like sick. And I had a severe panic attack. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with GAD. They put me on Fluoxetine which I was on for a month with no changes. So they then put me on Sertraline. It helped, but with terrible side effects. Now I am on Effexor which I think is helping with my anxiety a lot. Okay, so in the midst of that I also was diagnosed with a severe deviated septum which at the begging of Aug. I had surgery to fix. I thought that might be the cause of my brain fog, feeling fatigued all the time etc but I still feel off all the time. I had blood work done and everything came back normal, my thyroid was also tested which also came back normal. So now I have all these medical bills stacked up and still feel the exact same.

I haven't had a lot of experience in the dating pool, due to being really shy and not having the best of social skills growing up.Anyways, after staying clear of dating to work on myself for a couple of years, I decided a couple months ago to get back out there. I met someone through a dating app, and dispite busy schedules, we talked for about a month and then went on three dates, all successful. I feel comfortable around this person, I like them, and we've really hit it off. Now here's my issue: I want to ask where this is going. I would like to know where they are at in terms of us, and if this is going anywhere, however everytime I even think of starting this conversation I get extremely nervous and scared. My friend advised that I hint at how I feel, and wait until the other person brings it up first. But so far, nothing. I'm afraid of losing my chances with this pers...   \n",

In social situations i can barley handle myself, i can't speak to a large group of people if we are at a dinner table, i always have to think what i say and sometimes i don't find my words, i feel that they don't care what i have to say, or if i say something they will make fun of me.

       "19477  Hello everyone,The title pretty much explains what I'm going through. I hope this doesn't come across as tooting my own horn, because that's really not my intent. Basically, ever since I was younger (and sometimes still) people always bigged me up about how I am one of the smarter people they know and I'll do great and all that.About that, I personally never felt that way, I believe everything could be achieved with sufficient amount of effort, and I simply think the reason my peers think of me this way is because I'm extremely competitive and if I can't solve something, I could go at it for an entire day until I figure it out.All things considered, this made me believe that life would be somewhat easy (financially speaking) and I would find a way to generate a decent income as soon as I started focusing my efforts on it.

Since I live alone I often struggle with figuring out what to buy and in what amounts, so that it doesn't spoil, and putting aside the time to actually make the food.What is a good way to get myself into the habit of taking time out of my day to cook?How can I get motivated to learn more meals?   \n",

So I want to ask my dentist out for lunch but I don't know if it's appropriate. I've met her twice (both during appointment) so we don't know each other and I'm 18 and I think she's in her early to mid 20s. I've never asked anyone out for lunch before and honestly I kinda just want to keep it like as friends. Like going to lunch as friends. My problem is I don't know how to word it as just friends, like what do I say? Is it even okay to ask you're dentist that???   \n",

None of that was true, I went to see my ex [19f].

I didn't want to hear my parents be like I told you so. But everything went well and I went and now I am back home and the lie is still going about where I stayed and stuff.

He talks different now, acts different now, compains about different shit.. he even smokes now and lies to his family about it. The same problem happened last year during the summer and I literally had to beat the shit out of him for being his friends's bitch and then coming home and trying to treat us like we're his bitch too. I can tell it's working on his little brother(my other younger brother = L) too, because when they argued, they used to fight, and now they when older one starts some done shit with L, L just deals with it and adjusts.

It is the right phone, the other person insisted I check when it was given to me. Do I just assume they changed their mind and only wants in person contact, or should I ask why they ignore me digitally but will come up to me and act like it never happened in person? BTW only attempted to text twice on different days, didnt spam the person or anything.    \n",

Her parents are super fun and always doing something. I've gone on vacation with them several times and they text me whenever they're going on the lake and invite me boating. Seriously they've been a big part of my life. We're all 24 now, and we're getting into our careers, my career gives me A LOT of free time. Her career has her working around the clock about 6 days a week. Yesterday her parents invited me and my boyfriend to a cook out, said they had tons of food and drinks. I said we would make it and made plans to not get dinner because of it. Literally 10 minutes before I left, said friend texted me and told me she didn't feel comfortable with me going there without her, it makes her feel bad and feel like I'm closer with her parents than she is.

She had been in special education, but for the last couple of years had been spending only half the time in special education. The elementary school principal was awful to deal with. She was against my daughter being mainstreamed, even though my daughter's teachers all said it was a good idea. We aren't the only family that has had these kinds of problems, so I assumed she has issues with special needs students. My daughter had done so well that for sixth grade she was only going to have to be in special education for math. One day near the end of fifth grade, my daughter and her friends on the school bus decided to sing on the way home, and they annoyed the bus driver so much that he reported them and they got detention. My daughter did the detention and apologized, and since she had never been in trouble at school before, I didn't think this was a big deal.However, the principal had me come for a conference and made it seem ...</td>\n",

John claimed to be a member of the New Zealand Royal navy. I knew he was a phony from the beginning, since i am a member myself i noticed him wearing the uniform incorrectly on social media and when i met him at a party he told me stuff that didn't make sense such as serving in units that would've been impossible with his occupation and time he claimed to have enlisted etc. I have told Kathy and her friends my concerns but they never believed me because he had photos of him with groups of other navy guys on ships. Im guessing either photoshop or maybe he had a bunch of other phonies dress up on a ship or something idk.

       "51147   ThrowawayOkay, I have a two-month-old and am currently on paternity leave. I’m fortunate to work at a place that’s family-oriented and where I’m a senior employee. I’m able to get a longer than typical paternity leave by working remotely from home. However, I had to go into the office to get documents that could only be accessed on my work computer. I thought I would give my wife a break and let her sleep in. So I grabbed my kid and headed to the office.Only my boss knew I was coming in, so the office was surprised. And as people do, they gravitated towards the baby. Lots of cooing, holding, passing around, etc. This was all taking place inside my office. Then my baby started crying. I told my assistant that she can rock baby or walk around the office and they’ll go back to sleep. My assistant took her outside my office by her desk and I worked on gathering what I needed from my computer.I stop hearing crying and look up to see my assistant on her phone, no baby in her arms. I rus...   \n",

Finally, I got her up and told her to do the dishes. She was obviously sleepy, but I get woken up to do the dishes all the time, so I just wanted her to finish. My mom said I couldn't go to sleep until she did the dishes. I waited for my sister to finish, but she literally just stood in the kitchen and stared at the dishwasher and didn't do the dishes.

I'm worried about hurting my mom mentally, but I want to get it off my chest. I do feel slightly selfish for even wanting to tell them, since I have people to confide in that aren't my parents and the only benefit I get from telling them is possible understanding and not having to associate myself with religion. Would I be the asshole for telling them or is it worth the benefit?   \n",

I know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. He didn’t say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. I thought it’s weird they never told their daughters, given that they’re all such protestors against abortion.But anyways dad also has a sister, who’s daughter I’m really close with. She’s Christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last May. Then her boyfriend left her over it.

I will not respect her rule because I believe this needs to be normalized. Am I the asshole for peeing in my bathroom sink sometimes?This is a bit of a moral dilemma and I do not want to back down but will accept the judgement of the masses 1 opinion &lt; a lot of opinions   \n",
       "25358  I (31F) have been into fitness for the better half of my life. I love it when others are leading a healthy lifestyle too. My cousin (19F) is a little on the heavy side and has never been a sporty girl. I asked her parents last year if she went to the gym, and they said she didn’t. Thus, I bought her a two-year 24 Hour Fitness membership from Costco for $700 for her 19th birthday. Since it was an expensive gift that lasts two years, I joked that I won’t be getting her a present for her 20th birthday. I don’t see her often, maybe a little less than once a month. I would offer to be her workout buddy, but I don’t live near her. Every time I see her, I ask her if she has been going to the gym. She always says yes and briefly describes her routine. I give her some pointers about fitness and nutrition. It’s been over half a year now, but I’m not seeing any improvement in her body. If anything, it seems like she has packed on more weight in less desirable areas. I asked her today if she h...   \n",
       "57858  I have been friends with my best friend for about 10 years. We grew up together and our families have always been a big part of our lives. My parents are dead now. Her parents are super fun and always doing something. I've gone on vacation with them several times and they text me whenever they're going on the lake and invite me boating. Seriously they've been a big part of my life. We're all 24 now, and we're getting into our careers, my career gives me A LOT of free time. Her career has her working around the clock about 6 days a week. Yesterday her parents invited me and my boyfriend to a cook out, said they had tons of food and drinks. I said we would make it and made plans to not get dinner because of it. Literally 10 minutes before I left, said friend texted me and told me she didn't feel comfortable with me going there without her, it makes her feel bad and feel like I'm closer with her parents than she is. I was so upset by this, not only do I not want to hurt her feelings b...   \n",
       "1446   Last year, my daughter was finishing elementary school. She had been in special education, but for the last couple of years had been spending only half the time in special education. The elementary school principal was awful to deal with. She was against my daughter being mainstreamed, even though my daughter's teachers all said it was a good idea. We aren't the only family that has had these kinds of problems, so I assumed she has issues with special needs students. My daughter had done so well that for sixth grade she was only going to have to be in special education for math. One day near the end of fifth grade, my daughter and her friends on the school bus decided to sing on the way home, and they annoyed the bus driver so much that he reported them and they got detention. My daughter did the detention and apologized, and since she had never been in trouble at school before, I didn't think this was a big deal.However, the principal had me come for a conference and made it seem ...   \n",
       "47572  I'm from New Zealand and i live in Ireland at the moment. One of my friends, Kathy, is Irish and had been dating another kiwi named John. John claimed to be a member of the New Zealand Royal navy. I knew he was a phony from the beginning, since i am a member myself i noticed him wearing the uniform incorrectly on social media and when i met him at a party he told me stuff that didn't make sense such as serving in units that would've been impossible with his occupation and time he claimed to have enlisted etc. I have told Kathy and her friends my concerns but they never believed me because he had photos of him with groups of other navy guys on ships. Im guessing either photoshop or maybe he had a bunch of other phonies dress up on a ship or something idk. I was able to get someone i knew in the service to search up his name and i found that he actually enlisted but was dishonorably discharged within a week of entering for bad conduct. Obviously this means he is not a lieutenant and ...   \n",

I know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. He didn’t say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. I thought it’s weird they never told their daughters, given that they’re all such protestors against abortion.But anyways dad also has a sister, who’s daughter I’m really close with. She’s Christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last May. Then her boyfriend left her over it.

My sister and my mom never had a good relationship even as children. When my sister was old enough she moved across the county and had little interactions with my mom. When my mom suddenly passed she had me listed as the beneficiary on her life insurance. I handled all the estate and split half with my sister but kept the life insurance. Now, that my sister and my dad know I got the life insurance they are upset with me, even though I did all the work handling the estate. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with my sister and father, but I was the only one listed as a beneficiary so I have the right to keep the insurance money, right? Or should I have split it with my sister who was estranged from my mom. AITA here or do I have a valid point for keeping the insurance money?</td>\n",

They throw partys very often and one time i was using my bathroom and i heard someone come into my bedroom and i said \"dont come in\" and they still came into the bathroom and walked in on me using the crapper.   I have asked for a lock multiple times and they always shoot me down before i can even say anything. Once i tried to buy a lock and my dad said if i installed that he would break down my door. I do online school so i spend most of my day in my room but my parents come into my room 3-4 times a day without knocking and rearrange stuff even when i ask them not to.

       "2897   My fiancé and I have always split everything equally in regards to finances (the same job for different companies, so similar incomes). I love my fiancé and she’s very much the person I want to grow old with. She’s loving, caring, and extremely fiscally responsible. However I popped the question and eventually the topic of what to do in regards to our finances came around. My question stems from the fact that she is religious and I am not, this has never been a source of tension in our relationship (no judgement, Just not my thing), and she tithes her income. If we consolidate our income then that would make it 10% of our income. She brought this up being happy to give back, I tried to explain that I didn’t feel comfortable giving a large portion of my income to something that I’m not involved with and don’t really believe in. She got upset and told me that we are done with this conversation for a while and haven’t talked about it for a few days. It has nothing to do with the fact ...   \n",

They got married later on, converted to Christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. I know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. He didn’t say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. I thought it’s weird they never told their daughters, given that they’re all such protestors against abortion.But anyways dad also has a sister, who’s daughter I’m really close with.

I quickly picked the phone up off the table and went in the other room while my GF was still asleep and answered it. Sure enough, it was K and all I asked him was if he wanted my GF back. He admitted he did and that they had indeed been seeing each other on the side for a long time but said that nothing of a sexual nature had taken place (BS).

My mother pasted away a little over a year ago and I have one sister. My sister and my mom never had a good relationship even as children. When my sister was old enough she moved across the county and had little interactions with my mom. When my mom suddenly passed she had me listed as the beneficiary on her life insurance. I handled all the estate and split half with my sister but kept the life insurance. Now, that my sister and my dad know I got the life insurance they are upset with me, even though I did all the work handling the estate. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with my sister and father, but I was the only one listed as a beneficiary so I have the right to keep the insurance money, right? Or should I have split it with my sister who was estranged from my mom. AITA here or do I have a valid point for keeping the insurance money?   \n",
       "31317  Since i was little i have never had a lock on either my bedroom door or my bathroom door. (my bathroom is inside my bedroom) My parents will come into my room at night from 12am  - 3am about once a week to check if im asleep for whatever reason. They throw partys very often and one time i was using my bathroom and i heard someone come into my bedroom and i said \"dont come in\" and they still came into the bathroom and walked in on me using the crapper.   I have asked for a lock multiple times and they always shoot me down before i can even say anything. Once i tried to buy a lock and my dad said if i installed that he would break down my door. I do online school so i spend most of my day in my room but my parents come into my room 3-4 times a day without knocking and rearrange stuff even when i ask them not to. Also sometimes they will sit down on my couch for hours even when i say i want them to leave. I am 17 and last week at 5am my mom came into my room and snuck under the covers...   \n",

       "      <td>First time EVER on Reddit, so I’m really a noob here. We are having a fence installed on Monday, April 22. We signed the contract on March 15 for $2,700. They were booked out until April 22, so we just booked it based on that. We paid the deposit (50%), and signed the contract. Today, I received an email from the contractor telling me that I was quoted based on the old cost of materials, and that the $2,700 will now only cover materials. For this reason, they are now going to charge me $4,900 and will not complete the project for the agreed upon price. Looking at the contract, this is the only line that might protect them, but I’m not sure. “Where the contractor supplies materials and the contract does not include the supply of the same, the contractor shall provide invoices to show the extent of the supply and the client is bound by this contract to reimburse the contractor in the sum stated on the invoices submitted”. Does this allow them to keep my deposit? They offered to let m...</td>\n",

Problem is, no one knows why I went to the ER that I work with. One of my close coworker's knows a little, but nothing like what this supervisor said. My friend said she gave bare minimum information after being hounded as to why I could not come back.I have been sick a long time and I'm ready for my coworkers and medical directors to stop being so involved in my medical information and did not want to discuss these visits.

Our landlord allowed us to move into our space with a cat -no cat lease, or cat deposit- no problem. It wasn’t an issue at all to bring the cat in. Move forward to about two months ago, i start seriously looking into getting a dog. Realize that this could only be possible if the dog were to be registered ESA/service. Before even having my own paperwork gathered I started a dialogue with my landlord, put it in the open, I didn’t want to step on toes, whatever. She gets very upset and says I’m stomping on her livelihood, and that because she wasn’t aware of my ‘preexisting condition’ I have no rights about it.

Several bushes, a downspout, part of my gutter system, and garden. I called the police and they wrote up a report and charged her. Now, I will be wanting to get the gutter repaired along with the downspout but this led me to a question of: \"Since this is a Rowhome and the downspout is on my property but services multiple homes, is this still my financial burden/responsibility?\" Granted I will be submitting the neighbor the bill/estimate. But legally, is the downspout my legal responsibility in general. And if the neighbor refuses to pay, what are my options?   \n",

I live in an apartment in Montgomery, Alabama, USA. Today we discovered black mold that was behind peeling paint. We checked more places and saw water damage, as well as more black mold, both on the ceiling and the floor. The other tenants have noticed the same thing. We have an infant daughter, and obviously she cannot stay in a place with black mold. How do we get out of this with our deposit? Can I make the realtor come in with an inspector?    \n",
       "58605  First time EVER on Reddit, so I’m really a noob here. We are having a fence installed on Monday, April 22. We signed the contract on March 15 for $2,700. They were booked out until April 22, so we just booked it based on that. We paid the deposit (50%), and signed the contract. Today, I received an email from the contractor telling me that I was quoted based on the old cost of materials, and that the $2,700 will now only cover materials. For this reason, they are now going to charge me $4,900 and will not complete the project for the agreed upon price. Looking at the contract, this is the only line that might protect them, but I’m not sure. “Where the contractor supplies materials and the contract does not include the supply of the same, the contractor shall provide invoices to show the extent of the supply and the client is bound by this contract to reimburse the contractor in the sum stated on the invoices submitted”. Does this allow them to keep my deposit? They offered to let m...   \n",
       "49220  Back in August, I had arranged for a consignor to come to my home and pick up some designer clothes and fur coats to be sent to the company located in California. I had consigned with this company before, even with the same woman, without issue. It takes about 3 weeks for the consignment process to finalize; to ship from MD to CA, to evaluate my items, to photograph and list them on the site, etc. The 3 weeks come and go, but I still don't see my items listed on the website. I figure they're just running behind, so I wait another week, but still nothing.I try to reach out to the woman, but cannot get a hold of her, I email her, call her and text her. I start to worry, so I reach out to the company. I am told that the woman no longer works for the company. I do not know if she quit or was fired.I tell them that she had my consignment items in her possession when she left the company. They open a case and give me a case number to refer to.

       "17304  Hi! Hopefully someone can give me some insight here. I have quite a few medical problems and currently have FMLA. This weekend, I have had to go to the ER twice and have received doctor's notes each time, and properly notified my practice manager and medical directors (I work at a vet clinic). I just received a call from one of the receptionists asking how I was doing, and told me that my technician supervisor only told her a little about what was going on so she wanted to check on me. Problem is, no one knows why I went to the ER that I work with. One of my close coworker's knows a little, but nothing like what this supervisor said. My friend said she gave bare minimum information after being hounded as to why I could not come back.I have been sick a long time and I'm ready for my coworkers and medical directors to stop being so involved in my medical information and did not want to discuss these visits. I would like to speak with my practice manager when I return to work about th...   \n",

He probably has 4 in his driveway and another 6-7 on the street at any time.These cars are not nice looking or a collection, rather, they are \"time pieces\". My neighbor 'rents' them to companies who want to use them in the background of films.These cars take up most of the parking for the rest of the neighbors on our already crowded block. The registration sticker in the windshield is temporarily taped on (I assume it's to remove for filming, but he the specific cars rotate, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's a work around to avoid registering some)Is there anything we can do about this? I think it's unfair the neighbor hogs all of the street parking with vehicles that he is using for business purposes. I'd imagine commercial vehicles cannot be stored on the street, and I'm hoping this would be similar.TLDR: neighbor hogs street parking with vehicles he uses for business purposes.

       "12575  My niece was arrested in Illinois just prior to the end of a statute of limitations for a white-collar crime committed in California. She was not fleeing, and was open about trying to start a new life there with her family. Her retained California attorney indicated that if a charge were to come, she would know in advance, and would be able to turn herself in.This morning, without advance notice, police arrested and charged her in front of her children and husband, and a bail was set far exceeding (in my opinion) the crime (over $1,000,000!). I have a few questions:1.) What will the expected process be for her arraignment in Illinois, and extradition to California? Will her family be able to see her again before she is flown out to California?2.) Did the lawyer drop the ball on this? Indications were that the retained attorney would perform weekly checks on some sort of database to see if any of their clients were being charged for a crime. Should the lawyer have known and notified...   \n",

       "21527  Colorado here, near Denver. The neighbors across the street let their kids run rampant around our block. The kids are pre-kindergarten age and their mom is busy with a newborn so they are rarely watched. They bike in the street unsupervised, come onto our front yard and driveway to use it like a ramp into the road and have been caught in people’s backyards, ours included.  The kids are nice but have zero awareness of private property or street safety.  This has been happening consistently since we moved in over a year ago. The last straw for me is that they’ve been going into our backyard and don’t know how to close the gate.  I’ve told them to stay away but the little rascals treat it like a game and now try to be sneaky so they don’t get caught. I’m worried that our dogs will get out, potentially/accidentally hurt them or they might injure themselves on our tools/lumber. What can I do? Talking with the parents hasn’t changed anything, they’re happy to let them run around.  It’s j...   \n",

Do I have to pay an exorbitant amount and lawyer up just to deal with this in small claims court or can I just report it to the police and be done with it..?Not sure if it matters, but it's not particularly valuable.

I contacted the person I purchased from and they told me they won’t give me a refund because they sold the tanks as is. No where in the description did it say “as is”. Do I have any chance in small claims court to get a refund or is everything on Facebook “as is”?

We are renting it from the owner, but the condo is part of an association. Prior to signing the lease, the owner assured me verbally that our 2 cars would be allowed to park at the complex, but upon visiting the woman in charge of the association, we were informed that the owner lied about the second car, and that only one car is allowed. This is a huge issue as we are living beachfront, and there is no parking anywhere nearby. Is there anything we can do?   \n",

(I tossed this up to windows 10 being windows 10)* I'd come home to see my pc off (presumably it BSOD'd while i was away)* Games started crashing without errors (fine one minute, on the desktop the next, no warning or stuttering)* Apps, specifically their GUI started acting weird. (chrome's top bar would go black and flicker on only one window, always and ONLY the window that was on the leftmost monitor when it started)* Weird artifacting would start on games running on my leftmost monitor. (strange green patterns flashing. went away after resizing window)* Games, specifically KSP, would crash on load, or improperly load. (certain parts were missing or had the incorrect model assigned)* I think this is either a ram thing or a gpu think. Leaning to GPU because most of the symptoms are graphics or game related, but i'm not sure....</td>\n",

(I tossed this up to windows 10 being windows 10)* I'd come home to see my pc off (presumably it BSOD'd while i was away)* Games started crashing without errors (fine one minute, on the desktop the next, no warning or stuttering)* Apps, specifically their GUI started acting weird. (chrome's top bar would go black and flicker on only one window, always and ONLY the window that was on the leftmost monitor when it started)* Weird artifacting would start on games running on my leftmost monitor. (strange green patterns flashing. went away after resizing window)* Games, specifically KSP, would crash on load, or improperly load. (certain parts were missing or had the incorrect model assigned)* I think this is either a ram thing or a gpu think. Leaning to GPU because most of the symptoms are graphics or game related, but i'm not sure....   \n",

I decided to purchase a new card (rtx 2060 XC Ultra) and the card arrived tosay. Anyways I plug the card in and hook up a 6+2 pin into the 8 pin on the card and the fans spin upon boot up, like really loudly. The problem is I can’t find my card in the device manager and and the computer doesn’t seem to recognize it. I even tried searching for hidden devices without luck. Do I need to install drivers for it to show up? Because Nvidia won’t let me install drivers unless the gpu is detected. Also I don’t know how much more power is required to run the 2060 than the 980ti but it ran the 980ti just fine.Specs:EVGA RTX 2060 XC Ultra GamingI5 6600k600w thermaltake smart series psuAsus z170 pro gaming Mobo   \n",

I get highly volatile fps in any game, with a GPU usage chart that spikes and troughs between 20 and 90&amp;#37; usage in less than a second, giving gameplay an awful stuttering appearance. I've done several clean installs of drivers, tried reverting to previous drivers from months gone by, tried a hard reset of windows, I've even used two different GTX970s and had the exact same symptom! I'm running out of potential software causes and think the source of the problem may be a hardware issue, though I have no idea where to start on that. Please help!   \n",

This goes between BattleEye and EasyAntiCheat as far as I've tested. Across Origin or Steam. Games like Rising Storm 2, Apex Legends, 7 Days to Die, PUBG, Day of Infamy. These are all games I tested. Most of these I played on my previous system without issue (i5-4460, 12GB DDR3 RAM, same GPU and storage drives)What happens is when the game loads up, I get the initial splash, and when the AntiCheat tries to load, my PC blue screens, with consistent errors always referencing the same things.&amp;gt; On Mon 2/4/2019 10:05:49 ...</td>\n",

I'm having some trouble with dolphin. Numerous games I've tried run at around 60% so there is stuttering and messed up audio. My is a dell inspiron 7577 with a 1060, 16GB of ram and an i7 7700HQ. I turned all the NVIDIA junk off, reinstalled the most recent one, and have tried all other suggestions for settings online. Temps dont get above 60. ANy ideas?Edit I remember my computer makes other games run at 40fps but idk if it still does. They aren't choppy tho   \n",

       "23017  Hello everyone, and thanks in advance for any help.I've been facing this issue since I upgraded to a Ryzen 2600 System back in Oct. 2018. At the time the build was as follows:Ryzen 5 26000 (overclocked at times, but issue persists at Stock as well)Cooled by a Cryorig H7 PlusMSI B450-A Plus (latest drivers at the time)16GB G.Skill 3000MHz RAMGigabyte Gaming G1 GTX 1070 (Up-to-date drivers)Corsair TX650mMy issue is that I cannot play games that use Anti Cheat services. This goes between BattleEye and EasyAntiCheat as far as I've tested. Across Origin or Steam. Games like Rising Storm 2, Apex Legends, 7 Days to Die, PUBG, Day of Infamy. These are all games I tested. Most of these I played on my previous system without issue (i5-4460, 12GB DDR3 RAM, same GPU and storage drives)What happens is when the game loads up, I get the initial splash, and when the AntiCheat tries to load, my PC blue screens, with consistent errors always referencing the same things.&gt; On Mon 2/4/2019 10:05:49 ...   \n",

For example, does the bank now know I have debt and won't give me a good rate on a hypothetical future car loan? Or, is it good the bank sees me paying that balance to zero so it actually improves my standing with them? Or, is it all irrelevant?By the way, I'm in this situation because a few life emergencies hit all at once last year, draining my emergency fund and still racking up this few thousand on a credit card.

However, I have two main questions about them.1) If the company were to be bought out, what would happen to my stocks? How does that affect the company's stock when it is bought out? 2) It's my understanding that I'm only taxed on income generated from increased stock prices, a la capital gains. However, if the price has dropped, do I still pay taxes on that? My manager told me since its handled through E Trade they actually pay our taxes, and our service fees for using them cover that...

       "      <td>Quick question for all of you regarding loans vs down payment. My wife is in law school and will graduate in 2021. We would like to be able to buy something when we move. So here is the dilemma. My wife will come out of school with ~65k in debt. Realistically between my salary and her summer work we probably can come pretty close to paying that off completely by graduation. Or should we not pay off the debt and use our savings as a down payment for the move so we don’t owe any pmi on our mortgage. Other relevant info:-the only debt we have is my wife’s -combined salary should be around 220k after her graduation.</td>\n",

I would like to avoid opening a new card account just for this purpose, but my bank card is the one with a zero balance.Is there anything specific to bank credit cards that would make this a bad idea? For example, does the bank now know I have debt and won't give me a good rate on a hypothetical future car loan? Or, is it good the bank sees me paying that balance to zero so it actually improves my standing with them? Or, is it all irrelevant?By the way, I'm in this situation because a few life emergencies hit all at once last year, draining my emergency fund and still racking up this few thousand on a credit card. So, I'll be fine thanks to all the great advice I've read here. I just have this vague memory of reading a comment warning about balance transfers to a card at my own bank. Did I imagine that?   \n",

As of today it's about $2.5 a share, but I do have have about a healthy amount of them. I have to wait about 4 more years to let them vest. However, I have two main questions about them.1) If the company were to be bought out, what would happen to my stocks? How does that affect the company's stock when it is bought out? 2) It's my understanding that I'm only taxed on income generated from increased stock prices, a la capital gains. However, if the price has dropped, do I still pay taxes on that? My manager told me since its handled through E Trade they actually pay our taxes, and our service fees for using them cover that... But that doesn't sound right.Thanks!   \n",
       "20033  I received a 1099 from Google Adsense stating that I made ~$1K in ad revenue from my Disney park blog over the past year. The blog that I started 10 years ago is finally making some money! Most of that money is used to pay for web hosting and invest in other areas of the blog. Whatever is pocketed goes to fund printing branded apparel, travel (see below), etc. I'm not making a living off of the blog, but I couldn't afford to keep it online if it weren't for the ad revenue.I know the line between a hobby and business can become murky. Since I must travel to the parks I write about, I rack up a lot of travel-related expenses (roughly $3K in 2017). My questions:- Since I'm making this amount of money (and hope to make more moving forward), am I able to claim this as a business and write off travel, web hosting, etc.? While it started out as a hobby, I really do consider it to be a side job at this point - I devote a lot of time to upkeep, writing, etc.- I have a team of bloggers who a...   \n",

Then the truck balance has been getting lower by every 381.5 and I'm not sure to pay that off first. I have until 2021 to pay it off if i went the same route today.    \n",

They will not let her leave because she is not well enough to be on her own and would need caretakers to be taking care of her 24 hours a day. I can't live with her under any circumstances and I barely make enough money for myself to be helping her out. However, it hurts me to see her alone in the nursing home and I would love to help her go back home. She is only 59 years old, so I do not sure if Medicaid could help us. &amp;#x200B;If you folks could give me any recommendations, I would love to hear all choices. I am very overwhelmed with everything :(    \n",

My tax return will be big enough to just finish paying off the last bit of my student loans finally, but I have actually needed a new car for about 4 years. I always pay cash for everything and have been trying to buy a house for the last 2 years but there just hasn't really been anything worth while on the market in my area so I still haven't. So would you just pay off your student loans and take a hard pull on your credit for a car loan? Or would you buy a car with cash and just keep making your student loan payments without taking a hard pull?    \n",

       "4414   So i bought a vw golf r in August 2018.  It was a total of $51,000 (yes, i fucked up).  I bought this car after signing w/ for a new job that starts in Aug. 2019.They gave me a sign-on bonus of $25k, but after taxes, i received $16K.  I used it to pay of fall my credit card debt, which was about $14K.  So i only had $2k left.Im a 3rd year medical resident.  I make about $55K, ($1500 bi-weekly).  I pay $900 for my car, $900 for my apt (split w/ my gf) and utilities.  After all is said and done, I only have about $300 for spending money.When i start my job in Aug. 2019, ill be making around $160,000 after taxes.  I have a 16 year old toyota sequoia. it has about 195,000 miles.  I had my ar appraised and they said they would buy it for $31,000.  That would put me $20,000 in the whole, but I would take the $20,000 from the $31,000 and pay that off.  I would no longer have the $900 monthly payment and could be used for other things.

After good old Uncle Sam gets finished taking his share that comes out to be roughly $7,700/yr. At the moment I still have about $25,000 worth of student loan debt to pay back. That being said I would like to begin saving some money for a down payment on a house since I recently finished saving up enough for a 6 month emergency fund. Obviously, I think knocking out the student loans is important, but interest rates on homes are very low right now and I know that won’t last forever. My plan is to use the extra money from the raise to either begin saving for a down payment or start hitting the student loans harder. Which do you think would be the smarter move given the expected housing market over the next couple years?   \n",

My wife is in law school and will graduate in 2021. We would like to be able to buy something when we move. So here is the dilemma. My wife will come out of school with ~65k in debt. Realistically between my salary and her summer work we probably can come pretty close to paying that off completely by graduation. Or should we not pay off the debt and use our savings as a down payment for the move so we don’t owe any pmi on our mortgage. Other relevant info:-the only debt we have is my wife’s -combined salary should be around 220k after her graduation.    \n",

My current employer (been with them since I made the job switch in 2015) offers a 401k, but for whatever reason I decided to roll over the old 401k into an IRA instead of the new 401k.Here’s where I messed up big: I guess I didn’t really understand the difference between an IRA and a 401k other than that you can’t contribute more than $5,500 to an IRA. So, I set up an automatic monthly investmen...</td>\n",

We're not sure he's going to make it. I am hoping/praying for the best, but obviously, I would like to be prepared for the worst. If that does happen, he'll be survived by my mother (however her understanding of English is very limited, so she's relying on me).Some questions I have:\\-My dad did create a will, however it is based in WA state and we are all presently in FL. Is there any concern for this?\\-How does debt work? If a credit card was created in my dad's name alone, are my mom and I financially responsible? Does the same extend to a mortgage or even a loan?\\-What are my next steps? Do I need to hire an attorney? If so what kind? I mean literally ANY and ALL advice/information/pointers/tips/younameit would be greatly appreciated.Thanks   \n",

However, I am also seeking to pursue a side gig to make some extra money (about 30-45 an hour), but the way the company works, I would be a contractor with them (since I filled out a W-9 when I got the job). I am also now married and will have my first child in the coming weeks.I have a few questions that I'm hoping somebody might be able to answer for me.1. What will I now classify as when doing my taxes?2. How do the various incomes (salary from employer &amp; sole proprietor income) affect my tax returns?3. I have heard that sole proprietors pay extra taxes because of self employment taxes. Will I only pay those on the side gig income and then regular taxes on my salary income?4. Related to #3, people have told me that sometimes side gigs aren't worth it because of all the extra taxes. Does my situation seem like th...   \n",

       "20315  Using a throwaway account because I royally messed up and am honestly incredibly embarrassed with myself.I am in serious need of help with the state of my traditional IRA and don’t know what to do and honestly don’t really understand things and am freaking out. Basically, I switched jobs in 2015 and decided to roll over my 401k into an IRA. I had contributed only Roth contributions to the 401k, but from my understanding at the time, my Roth 401k contributions could be rolled over into a Roth IRA, but my employer matching contributions had to be rolled over into a traditional “Rollover IRA”. My current employer (been with them since I made the job switch in 2015) offers a 401k, but for whatever reason I decided to roll over the old 401k into an IRA instead of the new 401k.Here’s where I messed up big: I guess I didn’t really understand the difference between an IRA and a 401k other than that you can’t contribute more than $5,500 to an IRA. So, I set up an automatic monthly investmen...   \n",

My credit has been going up since I've had a card, only lost about 5 points when we applied for a lease and they did a credit and background check.My plan is to wait until my credit is around 750 to apply for a new card, and possibly have more chances of being approved, but how many cards do you need to build credit? CreditKarma always says having one account is not enough and I'd like to eventually have a card that gives me cashback on basic stuff (gas, groceries, etc). Also what will change for me if I had more than one card? Would the age of my account vary? If so how?I know it may seem like a lot of stupid questions but I'm interested in knowing what most people do and how their credit changed when they applied for a new card etc. I'm also hoping CK is accurate in terms of determining how high, or low, someone's credit is.   \n",

In 2017, I had a large debt that I was behind payments on because of a bad divorce. I contacted the company and offered to continue payments because I was in a place I could start paying again, but they refused and stated they wanted payment in full or they'd send it to collections or court. I ended up agreeing to pay them about $10,000 less than I owed and took out a loan to pay it.  I'm now getting a notice saying that $10,000 less I paid is considered \"income\" and I owe on my taxes for that year. Is this really the case? It seems hella shady as I really don't consider than income but I guess I still technically come out ahead overall money wise, but its kinda a kick in the balls to randomly get this.   \n",

How much safer?  How does one do that?* The insurance that brokerages have: is that federally backed? or just private insurer backed?* Mutual funds that we all invest in, do they hold their securities in street name of their brokerage OR do that hold them in their name?Thanks.   \n",

I sell commercial construction and live and die off the economy as I learned in 2009.  I am currently making 250-400k a year (sales) driven. I’m looking for a place to invest money for when this building boom in Wisconsin slows. I know nothing about investing but I would really like some unbiased advice for investing. Thanks    \n",
       "55990  So I've been meeting with three different wealth management companies and trying to determine what my next steps are. To provide some background (beyond the info in the title): I've been risk adverse my entire life regarding investments, I don't even like to gamble. The only money I have in retirement accounts is a result of 401ks or old ones I've rolled over (115K in a Stifel IRA). At this point I know I'm losing money based on inflation, so I really want to take the plunge and keep my money in an accessible vehicle that offers a reasonable rate or return without avoiding losing everything like many did in ~2008. I'm single, have a pretty stable job (likely a salary of right around 160K as long as I want it), have no debt outside of a 15K car note and 197K owed on my mortgage (house would sell for around 475K currently). I put in about 15K into the 401K every year, and my employer throws an additional 6K on top of that.I've been taking meetings with Stifel, Northwestern Mutual and...   \n",

I just got a “real” job making 70k. I’ve been working bs jobs and screwing off in my entire 20s. I’m now finally making decent money and have a college degree. I have no savings, no retirement savings. My job doesn’t even offer a 401k. I’m going to open a RoTH Ira, but can I rely on this to retire? If I contribute the max each year into a Roth IRA, can o retire comfortable? I’m assuming I’ll also have some social security as well? I live in Houston Texas. Edit: I have no debt aside from a car loan for 9k @4.9%    \n",
       "42061  First off - thank you for the advice already given (paid off all outstanding debt!).Situation:~32 years old, worked for a while, went back to school for a Master's degree and took on significant debt/wiped out savings (made many mistakes here, didn't think I could use my 401k to pay for tuition...resulted in +$6k in interest). Note, going back to school was absolutely worth it, pay pump of about 65%; under-employed before...similar to other 2008ish graduates.Have a 401k from a previous employer with about 25k in it, 0.65% expense ratio:From some redditor's (pjoll)it looks like I have the following options:1. You can leave it there (assuming it is allowed).2. You can rollover the funds into your current 401(k).3. You can roll the funds into a Traditional IRA (or even a Roth IRA, but that depends on your situation).Questions: 1. It doesn't seem like there is a good reason to leave the 25k in the old 401k because I can get a lower expense in a traditional IRA - however, can I roll all...   \n",

       "18893   Hey there, so like the title suggests I have a few questions regarding a new PC build I am working on. Doesn't help that the stuff I want FOR the build aren't even out yet but I want to try and see if I can get some general guidance on this stuff before I commit to my 2nd build. See, I am a youtuber, and I love to record and edit on my PC but right now I am rocking a Ryzen 5 2600 with a total of 1.5TB of storage. Currently using the 500GB SSD as OS boot and smaller game storage, while 1TB (7200RPM HDD) is for everything else.So first things first, the build (my first watercooled build, and I am going all out)Case: ROG Strix HeliosMobo: Crosshair VIII FormulaCPU: Ryzen 7 3800X/Ryzen 9 3900X (waiting on more X570 vs X590 with the whole R9 only works on x590 rumor I've seen)GPU: RX 5700 XT (Again something not finalized cause if Nvidia drops RTX prices I will get a 2070)RAM: Team Group Nighthawk 2x8GBStorage:1TB Seagate Barracuda (Just my old drive)3TB Seagate Barracuda2x 2TB Team Gr...   \n",

I contributed in 2017, but currently make more than the maximum amount to contribute to a Roth (&gt;$150k salary). I max out my 401K every year and also contribute to a traditional brokerage account. My first question was, does it make sense for me to have a backdoor Roth IRA? Anything I should be aware of if I do?&amp;#x200B;Also, I contributed to my Roth IRA early 2018 before I realized I made too much. I withdraw all of the money and now when I try to contribute to a traditional IRA (before I backdoor) it says I contributed the max for 2018 already even though I withdraw it a few weeks later (and I will pay the ordinary income on the gains). Is it possible to still contribute to an IRA for 2018 given this information and if so how? I have Vanguard, will I need to call them and get them to override this?&amp;#x200B;Thanks!!!    \n",
       "5466   (New York)My upstairs neighbors are either elephants or they wear heavy boots and high heels whenever they walk around their apartment. I can hear every single step when they stomp, and they are constantly stomping. They drop heavy things on the floor pretty regularly and it sounds like they’re constantly rearranging furniture, but I can’t be sure. I’ve tried twice to go to the neighbor who lives below me to ask if they can hear me walking around, but they didn’t answer. I went to the upstairs neighbors and, as politely as I could, ask them to be more mindful of their noise because I could hear when they walk and drop things. They acted surprised (and looked kind of defensive) but said they would - they haven’t. They still stomp around and drop things at all hours - early on Sunday mornings, late into weekday evenings.I talked to the property manager and she was empathetic, sent some e-mails out, but the problem persists. When I brought it up again, she said she’s continuing to try...   \n",

I've got a 550W Corsair PSU, a Gigabyte (can't remember the full name) AM3+ socket Motherboard, Asus GeForce GTX 1050TI and 8GB of HyperX RAM. So to conclude, would it worth me upgrading?    \n",

       "20033  I received a 1099 from Google Adsense stating that I made ~$1K in ad revenue from my Disney park blog over the past year. The blog that I started 10 years ago is finally making some money! Most of that money is used to pay for web hosting and invest in other areas of the blog. Whatever is pocketed goes to fund printing branded apparel, travel (see below), etc. I'm not making a living off of the blog, but I couldn't afford to keep it online if it weren't for the ad revenue.I know the line between a hobby and business can become murky. Since I must travel to the parks I write about, I rack up a lot of travel-related expenses (roughly $3K in 2017). My questions:- Since I'm making this amount of money (and hope to make more moving forward), am I able to claim this as a business and write off travel, web hosting, etc.? While it started out as a hobby, I really do consider it to be a side job at this point - I devote a lot of time to upkeep, writing, etc.- I have a team of bloggers who a...   \n",

This year when time for the lease rolled around my landlord didn’t email me asking if I wanted to renew. While paying my rent the next month I asked him if I needed to renew the lease.  He just said, “you’ve been living here for, what, two years? Nah, it’s fine.” I’m not sure what this means. Am I under lease? Am I renting month to month? Can they kick me out whenever they like? We don’t have any problems and I’ve always paid my rent on time. It’s kind of a shady area so I get the feeling that I’m one of the few tenants who never cause issues. I’m just wondering where I stand legally.    \n",
       "41295     Just graduated college in May. Scored a pretty decent job making 25k a year salaried, and 25-30k on commissions. I make around 50-55k / year. I have no debt, I already own a car (no car payment, paid in cash). I pay around 900$ in rent and utilities. I track my expenses and income, and I net around 1-1.5k per month in the green. I have stocks that I’ve been putting that money into stocks that pay dividends 10% annually. I already have 20k in savings. I’m 22, id like to buy a house one day, maybe when I’m 26-28? Is there anything else I can do to set myself up for financial success? My job is super super relaxed and easy and I love my job and my co workers. I think I have a good chance of growing with the company too. My fiancé is graduating this May and I want to make sure he and I can live comfortably! Any advice or insight is appreciated. I live in a big city, where buying a condo costs 500-600k. How soon could I be ready to buy a house? Any advice on what I could be doing more?    \n",

My previous company is also in the process of closing another round of funding, so this means the strike price will/ already gone up.* I have exercised ex: 10k shares at $1 and current strike price is $5 - AMT tax to be paid next year would be $17k* ex: I still have 1400 shares to exercise but the strike price will go up to $12 - AMT tax can potentially be $6.6k1. I already paid ( including next year AMT tax) $10k+$17k = $27k on buying company options, do you recommend me to pay another $8k to get the rest of the options (14%)? Say the company is doing well2.

As per our lease we were supposed to give 60 days notice to terminate. Our closing is on aug 29, so the first week of this month we worked out a verbal agreement with the landlord that we would pay half of August rent and they would take the other half out of our security deposit and use our last months rent for the month of September unless they found a new tenant. If they found a new tenant by sept 1, we would be given our last months rent back as well as the other half of our security deposit.

This happened in Ontario, Canada. This past weekend (Sept. 2), my s/o and I (both 20) were in an accident on a major highway. Long story short, we were in the left-most lane, someone braked in front of the guy in front of us, we couldn't brake in time, moved into the centre lane to avoid rear-ending the guy in front of us, and the guy in front of us swerved into the centre lane, and therefore, into us. We were pushed onto the shoulder of the highway via the impact, and the car is basically a write-off. Everyone was fine at the scene, no ambulance needed to be called. The day after (Sept 3), we started having neck and back pain, which has progressively gotten worse, so we decided to see a chiropractor clinic which was recommended to us via the tow-truck driver, who we have come to trust and view as a supportive individual...</td>\n",

My previous company is also in the process of closing another round of funding, so this means the strike price will/ already gone up.* I have exercised ex: 10k shares at $1 and current strike price is $5 - AMT tax to be paid next year would be $17k* ex: I still have 1400 shares to exercise but the strike price will go up to $12 - AMT tax can potentially be $6.6k1. I already paid ( including next year AMT tax) $10k+$17k = $27k on buying company options, do you recommend me to pay another $8k to get the rest of the options (14%)? Say the company is doing well2. This is considered a huge pay cut to buy company options. What is your thought on this? Do you set yourself a limit to exercise company options or you just exercise all regardless?   \n",

       "30308  Hi Legaladvice - long time lurker, first time poster (on a throwaway) - I was hoping I'd never have to seek out your wisdom, but here I am. Hopefully you can help. This happened in Ontario, Canada. This past weekend (Sept. 2), my s/o and I (both 20) were in an accident on a major highway. Long story short, we were in the left-most lane, someone braked in front of the guy in front of us, we couldn't brake in time, moved into the centre lane to avoid rear-ending the guy in front of us, and the guy in front of us swerved into the centre lane, and therefore, into us.

We were also in a long distance relationship. Recently, I think about 3 weeks ago now, she moved into a flat with two of her male coworkers. I had absolutely no problem with this because I trusted her with my life. Last night she seemed real off when I called her to catch up, so I text her afterward and I asked if everything was alright between us. This is where life went a bit off the tracks. She said she couldn’t hide it from me anymore and that she kissed her flatmate the night before. Her reasoning was because she wanted to at the time. I’m crushed. I feel completely alone and I have no idea what to do. We talked things through and she’s said she’s genuinely sorry and wants to stay with me but she thinks we both need a bi...   \n",

This is my first ever speeding ticket and run in with police. I’m 19. I’m moving literally next monday to return to university across the country. My court appearance is scheduled for Oct 1st. I will not be here, In Colorado, to appear. The police officer said he was kind of unsure why it was mandatory since i am over 18. What on earth do i do? am i supposed to fly back? do i hire a lawyer? do i ask the court to move my appearance back? it’s 4 points, which i really want to get reduced as 4 points is 1/3rd of the way until i lose my license in my state!!! help please :( thank you!</td>\n",

I will have 2 or 3 interrogations by the police, including a lie detector test. Then I will will have 2 or 3 interrogations by a prosecutor. There is a chance I will be successful during this process and my case will be dismissed. However, if I am not successful up to this point then my case will go to court.The problem is, if I lose in court I will get jail time.

Got pulled over yesterday the 10th of sep for speeding, 40 in a 30 (10 over). My ticket does not say a fine, only “mandatory court”. Here’s where it gets fun! This is my first ever speeding ticket and run in with police. I’m 19. I’m moving literally next monday to return to university across the country. My court appearance is scheduled for Oct 1st. I will not be here, In Colorado, to appear. The police officer said he was kind of unsure why it was mandatory since i am over 18. What on earth do i do? am i supposed to fly back? do i hire a lawyer? do i ask the court to move my appearance back? it’s 4 points, which i really want to get reduced as 4 points is 1/3rd of the way until i lose my license in my state!!! help please :( thank you!   \n",

I checked my credit report, and this account is \"charged off\" and is negatively affecting my score. I never received such billing invoice for this loan, how can I dispute this with the credit bureaus? Thanks for your time and help!   \n",
       "41615  Hi! Thanks for taking a moment to read through this. I need some advice/input because I'm not sure if I'm just being paranoid, or if my gut is steering me in the right direction. If this is better suited for another sub, please let me know!I'm trying to move out of the place I'm in now, with the aim of moving this fall/winter. I live in Seattle, so as you can imagine, the rent here is absolutely insane, and it's a struggle for me to make enough money to even be able to move out of this godforsaken house I've been trapped in for 5 years.I found a sublease listing on Craigslist for rent at $1000 per month. The tenant of the apartment that is being subleased is on a rotation down in Los Angeles (is a nurse) and will be returning next summer. We'll call him Gary. The place is furnished, and the rent is extremely appealing - be all appearance it's a great deal that'll enable me to get the fuck out of the place I'm currently in, and leave me plenty of time to figure out my next step when...   \n",

I want to open a Vanguard index fund, but I worry that I don't have enough income to make meaningful contributions to all three of those at once. Is it possible/would it make sense to somehow transfer the funds from my Roth into the index fund? Would it be worth it to maintain all three investment accounts at once even if it meant contributing less to my Roth or 401k each month?   \n",

I also just got my first bonus of $700 and they taxed off about $250 from it. A lot of people were telling me to file tax exempt form every bonus (we have quarterly bonuses) but my Dad told me that let them take the tax and wait for the return. He said be patient. My Mom also doesn't file tax exempt and says you can either have your money now or later. I don't know how any of it works. What is tax exemption, should I not being paying taxes? Why is it they take more out of my bonus then they do out of my normal check, my bonus is a reward and I feel like I should have more access to it. No one taught me this stuff in school    \n",
       "52137  Marijuana becomes legal for recreational use in Canada on October 17; my lease is up for renewal on this same day. I've lived in this apartment since 2016.My landlord just sent notice of a lease modification to add the following clause: \"It is forbidden to consume cannabis or any form of drug, illegal or otherwise. This prohibition applies to all indoor and outdoor areas of the property, including but not limited to the residence, land, balconies, terrace, and common areas.\"The original lease has no mention of drug, cannabis, or tobacco use.Is this legal and enforceable?

The new law says tobacco and tobacco products cany be sold to anyone under the age of 21. I buy a lot of CBD isolate for chronic back pain because its cheaper than buying weed but now im worried i wont be able to purchase it anymore because im only 19. Somebody told me people who are already 18 before the law goes into effect dont have to worry, but i cant find anything to verify this.Tl;Dr Can i buy CBD products in delaware after they raised the legal age to buy tobacco products to 21, even if i was already 18 before the law was put into effect.   \n",

I have so many things I need to do like work, clean, go to the dentist, sign back up for college, go to the gym, run errands, but I always find an excuse for myself to not do it that day, and it happens every day. I need to get my life together. I'm 5\"7, and weigh 240 pounds. I don't eat completely terrible but there's room for improvement for a diet. I know this is very common but I feel like it's gotten bad. I just need some tips on maybe motivating myself and some tips on how to get more energy throughout the day. I'm always super tired no matter the time. And I feel like at 21, I should be at my prime, bursting with energy. But I'm not. I feel like my life is wasting away cause all I do is work, eat and sleep. I want to do something with my life. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.   \n",

I highly trust this mechanic, and even if some other place offered a lower price I wouldn't risk it. Currently I am looking at a 2017 Hyundai Accent for $11000. It's got 44,000 miles, and is still under manufacturer warranty. My problem lies in the fact that i do not have $11000, and I would need to finance this car. I have good credit, and a friend told me that a credit union could probably get me a loan at 5.5%. My dilemma is that I am a student in college, and while I could afford basically any car payment while I work full time during the summer, I really only work enough during the school year to afford a $150-$200/month payment.So here is my question: How do I make this work?

       "51908  Hello everyone.  I’ve been a lurker here for a couple years and this is my first time posting.    I’ll be up front, I was a little hesitant to post on here because I have seen some of the other posts that people make (do I choose this $90k job or this $105k job, or how do I invest this $30,000 I’ve saved in the last two years).  My situation is not like that.  In fact,  I’d be jumping for joy to have those kinds of problems.  The situation:  my wife and I live in a rural area, and we both make $12 an hour, and work full time (40 hrs/week).  We have our big bills like rent (800) car payment (300) and childcare (500) and a series of other smaller bills like utilities that total out to roughly 1700 monthly (including our food/gas).  We do well on budgeting, and live within our means, but that being said, we are barely able to keep our heads above water.  We are living paycheck to paycheck. We have little money for extras like taking my family out to dinner, or even just going for a dr...   \n",

I have known about benign tumors called schwannomas that are growing on my spine for almost 10 years now. I've had the same medical coverage since 2014. In late 2015 I had surgery to remove one of them for my thoracic spine, all except $250 covered. The $250 was a co-payment. In January of 2017, I had one removed from my brain. Same story, everything except 250 covered. Since these tumors grow on nerves they can cause quite extreme pain and were threatening my quality of life and potentially my life itself, with partial paralyzation being the best outcome if they were not removed.On November 6th I had one removed from my sciatic nerve.

I’m 26M and, after buying a ring for my soon-to-be fiancé I will have about 21k in cash in a savings account. I calculate six months bare minimum expenses at about 18k. I make 90K, contributing 10% to my Roth 401k (plus company match of 4.5%). I have about 18k in student loan debt (payments are $290 a month), with an average interest rate around 5%. I owe about 4K on a car worth about 5k. My 401k balance is 51K. I’m able to put away about $650 a month (though a portion of that eventually is spent on vacation), and my SO is in about the same financial situation as me. We rent in a medium-cost city for $1850 a month. My question if you’ve made it this far: At what point do I cap my emergency fund and start investing?

His plan is for her to move in but not be added to the lease (landlord won’t approve her because she has no job/money). He said he will cover the rent in full. He has the means to do so but I don’t want to bank on him sticking to his word. He said that he would be willing to sign whatever I ask.
