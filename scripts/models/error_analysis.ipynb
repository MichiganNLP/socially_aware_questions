I hate to seem emo because I think I'm a pretty cheerful happy guy in general, but it's gotten to the point where if I see a freshman couple in the hallway or see pictures of other freshman in relationships I get sad. I feel really anxious about the that I don't have a girlfriend, because I'm very average in looks and whatnot and I perform well academically, and Im not bothered by who it is as long as I can have the authentic boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, so I don't see any distinct disadvantages that I have.

I don't know why I care so much, because I basically just imagine myself doing stuff with girls, which I would normally do with friends (with the odd but of handholding). I hate to seem emo because I think I'm a pretty cheerful happy guy in general, but it's gotten to the point where if I see a freshman couple in the hallway or see pictures of other freshman in relationships I get sad. I feel really anxious about the that I don't have a girlfriend, because I'm very average in looks and whatnot and I perform well academically, and Im not bothered by who it is as long as I can have the authentic boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, so I don't see any distinct disadvantages that I have.

If this post is not appropriate, feel free to remove but please direct me to a subreddit where i can talk about it. Since you guys are teenagers too i suppose, i can talk to you about this i guess. My parents are all good but sometimes they have very physical fights. They both hit each other and most of the time it is too violent for me to control. Things usually calm down after a day or two. I also have a younger sister (she's 5) and i usually go out of the house with her whenever the fights happen. Also my parents are kind of conservative in nature, i dont know how they would feel if i told them that i liked girls too. Ive never dated anyone but ive had a fair amount of crushes. At my school, if it were to get out that i was bi, then id be shunned and shamed about how it isnt right.

She has openly stated that she has used coke, she smokes weed, and has done other drugs along with stealing. I assumed that it was in the past. However, we were driving back to my house one night from a date and it came up in conversation and she nonchalantly informed me that she has Ecstasy on her. I did not know what to say, I was shocked so I just told her to never do steal or do drugs around me.  I am not comfortable as I have gotten over a childhood past filled with similar situations. I do not trust her around my things or in my house for that matter. How do I address this situation if at all? I don't want to be rude or disrespectful and I don't want to completely drop her with no reason as to why.   \n",

I tried to talk to someone last year but it was too expensive. Any alternatives you have found helpful? Free activities? Any advice is appreciated thank you! I don’t want to lose my bf because I can’t be nice to him because of my own personal issues   \n",
       "42508  I'm mainly worried because this was my fault and the phone is on finance so now I am essentially paying for a phone I don't have.A little background first, So I was at the Vans store earlier today buying some new trainers.

I leave it on the chair beside me and take off the shoes to give to the cashier who takes it to the till and I follow him. I pay for these trainers and walk out the store ready to go home until I tap my pocket and realise oh, I forgot my phone.

       "23195  Hello all, im a 14 year old girl and im currently in high school. I made this account as a way to vent my feelings. If this post is not appropriate, feel free to remove but please direct me to a subreddit where i can talk about it. Since you guys are teenagers too i suppose, i can talk to you about this i guess. My parents are all good but sometimes they have very physical fights. They both hit each other and most of the time it is too violent for me to control. Things usually calm down after a day or two. I also have a younger sister (she's 5) and i usually go out of the house with her whenever the fights happen. Also my parents are kind of conservative in nature, i dont know how they would feel if i told them that i liked girls too. Ive never dated anyone but ive had a fair amount of crushes. At my school, if it were to get out that i was bi, then id be shunned and shamed about how it isnt right. I dont really have friends and the ones that i have are mostly extremely toxic in na...   \n",

       "30486  I've (32F) worked retail for the same company for 13 years. I've been steadily promoted every 2-3 years.  I currently make 76,000, but it's taking a lot of my time and energy. There are no real options to move forward without relocation. I bought a house last year, I'm engaged to be married next summer. No kids, but possibly after we're married. I don't have much else going on. It's just work and hanging with my fiance.  I want a new career, but everyone says to hang on to what I have.  I'm not miserable or anything, but I don't have a good work/life balance. I'm out of my house 12+ hours a day.  However, I'm also paying off debts and putting away money in a 401k, so financially I feel like I'm maturing. I've applied to other retail jobs, but I haven't found much with the same pay.I don't always feel I qualify for much outside of retail, but I feel stunted where I am now.

I hardly make anyone proud anymore. Not even my own mother, and her standards are pretty damn low. Might be because she's absent from my life at this point.So, any advice on what I should do? I suppose stop being such a stupid bastard would be the most obvious, but being the absolute retard that I am, I wouldn't have an idea as to how I'm fucking up. It always seems like, in my eyes at least, that I just make a mistake every now and then.....</td>\n",

       "52370  I'm so useless...I can't do even basic stuff like put down the knob in the shower above the faucet thing or whatever, or close doors, or maybe I forget to. I always try my best to pay attention and remember every single thing, but I always fuck up. I can't do anything right. My dad's right. Two weeks and then I go back to being an absent minded fuck. I always screw everything up and make my father even more disappointed as the days go on. By the end of next year, he'll hate me for sure. I'm also gonna be a failure at life. A massive one, at that. I hardly make anyone proud anymore. Not even my own mother, and her standards are pretty damn low. Might be because she's absent from my life at this point.So, any advice on what I should do? I suppose stop being such a stupid bastard would be the most obvious, but being the absolute retard that I am, I wouldn't have an idea as to how I'm fucking up. It always seems like, in my eyes at least, that I just make a mistake every now and then.....   \n",

       "40536  Slightly misleading title. I'm a generally happy guy. I am 30, happily married, have a great job, great family, amazing puppies (they make everything better)... But I often get very overwhelmed. My job is demanding and I'm still a part time student. When i get overwhelmed I typically shut down and quit at things or admit defeat. I also have issues with being tired. I am very active in my job and personal life, but as soon as I sit down my eyes want to shut. I have trouble getting up in the morning and I want to nap every day after work. I suppose you call this \"being an adult.\"However, this is where it gets interesting. I had an injury about a decade back that caused me to need painkillers. I never got addicted to them and rarely ever took them in the last decade. There was the occasional bad day that i would need one but I always tried to avoid it. I had one of those bad days recently and took half of a painkiller (Vicodin).

       "23580  As the title states, my mum and fiance hate each other. I'm not sure how or why this all started, but it first showed 4 months ago when I ended up in hospital for a while. My mum became over protective and basically pushed my fiance aside. I noticed this change in her behaviour and asked my fiance how she felt, which ended up being quite hurt and annoyed. I messed up by telling them both to go out, get a coffee and talk things over. I was still in hospital at that point and didn't go with them. I don't know how the conversation went but it started one hell of a toxic rivalry. Anyway things stayed quiet until today, my birthday. My mum came over to see me, but instead ended up breaking out into a big fight with my fiance and blowing things right into the sky before storming out. I got a text message later on saying she has no desire to see my fiance anymore. We're meant to be getting married early next year, but now this has thrown a big spanner in the works.

But this week he penciled me into the schedule for 28+ hrs. I am exausted between school, this new job, and extra curricular activities. Would it be acceptable to call the manager and ask for a reduction of hrs this week (only saturday and sunday are left this week)?I dont want to leave a poor impression early in my time with them but could really use less hrs.

On Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. So they did this every day this week until Thursday when my daughter came home from her CIT job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if I was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing ...</td>\n",

As you can imagine, that makes it pretty difficult to do anything, never mind cleaning. I (19f) live with my boyfriend (23m) in a cosy little 2 bed flat with our kitten. It’s been a long standing argument between my boyfriend and I about cleaning. In our current jobs, I work more hours in longer shifts than him and work evenings and weekends. He currently has a job which is 7-4 with evenings and weekends off.  Before I fractured my elbow I did pretty much everything in terms of cleaning while he cooked. While this raised a few arguments (he would do absolutely nothing except cook. Laundry, washing up, cleaning the cats litter? Forget it, my job, even if I worked 7 days straight which I often do). I would often come home from working 12pm -11pm and have to clean and pick up after him because he hadn’t and is naturally very messy. While this wasn’t a perfect arrangemen...</td>\n",

As you can imagine, that makes it pretty difficult to do anything, never mind cleaning. I (19f) live with my boyfriend (23m) in a cosy little 2 bed flat with our kitten. It’s been a long standing argument between my boyfriend and I about cleaning. In our current jobs, I work more hours in longer shifts than him and work evenings and weekends. He currently has a job which is 7-4 with evenings and weekends off.  Before I fractured my elbow I did pretty much everything in terms of cleaning while he cooked. While this raised a few arguments (he would do absolutely nothing except cook. Laundry, washing up, cleaning the cats litter? Forget it, my job, even if I worked 7 days straight which I often do). I would often come home from working 12pm -11pm and have to clean and pick up after him because he hadn’t and is naturally very messy. While this wasn’t a perfect arrangemen...</td>\n",

The problem is that my husband and I both come from Jewish families and my husband insists any potential sperm donor is Jewish. We don’t live in a western country so finding Jewish sperm donors is impossible. We flew to America to get IVF done at a clinic but unfortunately the pregnancy didn’t go to term. It’s too expensive to try again right now.I was recently messaged by a potential donor. He ticked all the right boxes. Successful, handsome, fit, healthy, etc. Honestly the best donor by far we have met. I knew my husband would say no since he wasn’t Jewish... so I lied. I asked the donor to pretend. He was hesitant but after I explained the long ordeal he went a head with it. I just confirmed I’m pregnant.AITA?   \n",
       "42739  I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him.

       "27195  Hi reddit! So first off a bit of background, I currently have a fractured elbow which I managed to do five days ago. As you can imagine, that makes it pretty difficult to do anything, never mind cleaning. I (19f) live with my boyfriend (23m) in a cosy little 2 bed flat with our kitten. It’s been a long standing argument between my boyfriend and I about cleaning. In our current jobs, I work more hours in longer shifts than him and work evenings and weekends. He currently has a job which is 7-4 with evenings and weekends off.  Before I fractured my elbow I did pretty much everything in terms of cleaning while he cooked. While this raised a few arguments (he would do absolutely nothing except cook. Laundry, washing up, cleaning the cats litter? Forget it, my job, even if I worked 7 days straight which I often do). I would often come home from working 12pm -11pm and have to clean and pick up after him because he hadn’t and is naturally very messy. While this wasn’t a perfect arrangemen...   \n",
       "36963  My ex and I were high school sweethearts and we were together for around 6 years. We started dating in high school and we stayed together in uni since we were in the same city, then we broke up a few months after we graduated. If it matters, I broke up with him. This was in 2012 and we literally haven't seen each other or talked since but we still have some mutual friends from high school and uni.One of those mutual friends got married last month and I was in the wedding party. When he and his fiance were putting together the guest list I asked them not to invite my ex.

       "27559  Ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.Me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which I pay for by myself, as I make enough money to afford it and I didn’t want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend. We also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn’t want to go through that again in this one.The fact that I pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course I pay in part for). Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.Anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun.

He's always had this thing about me not talking about my past relationships, which is ok with me, but it's to the point of even mentioning that I  simply dated other people. So I've tried to do that.What I'm not cool with was the fact that while he has this standard, it only applies to me. He talks about he ex wives fairly often, and his refrigerator is covered with post it notes with phrases people have said that he find memorable. Many of them are about sex. For example, one said \"all I have to offer are band aids, beer and boobies.\" I brought this double standard up and he took a few if the notes down. He kept saying,\"I should just really take them down.\" I kept waiting but he didn't. Last weekend we got in a fight. I've been down due to work issues and he told me to stop wallowing in self pity.  Then, after I talked and some of my body insecurities, he told me that he once dated a model. I got very upset. When he was asleep I took al...   \n",

She mixes our names up all the time. At least 3 times a day. We know she’s doing it on purpose to annoy us. So. Yesterday I was in living room and she called me my twin’s name. I just ignored her and pretended she wasn’t there. Then she called me my name and I answered her normally. My brother did the same, we did it few times. Now she’s mad at us, apparently we’re being extremely disrespectful and not being sympathetic because she makes “honest mistake” sometimes.   \n",

He apologizes and says, “I’m sorry I’m just trying to eat.” And out of anger I said “I don’t care if you’re starving  you can’t do that.

At this point he says “is that what you’re going in?” to which I reply “well what if I don’t want to go?” and he says “tough shit.” Now that really just pushed me to the point of just saying outright that “it’s my last day of summer vacation, why would I want to spend 6 hours of it doing something I don’t want to do?” and then all hell broke loose.

We were concerned for him, but he seemed very well-fed and clean, so we assumed that he was just a wanderer since he only came around certain times of the day. We asked around with neighbors that we could find to see if anyone owned him. None of the neighbor's we could get in contact with knew about him. About a month ago, during a particularly cold night, he showed up on our front porch shivering. At that point, my housemate and I decided that we needed to take action. We took him to a local vet to be scanned for a microchip -- and lo and behold, he had one. However, it was registered to a phone number several states away and the number was now disconnected. From the microchip, we also found out the name of the owner and that she had adopted the cat in 2008.

       "28893  So , my boyfriend is very gaseous and farts *a lot*. At first it was kinda funny, and my roommate and her boyfriend found it a bit amusing, so it was a bit acceptable. But he sleeps over a lot and would find no problem farting in the room, in bed with me, among company, etc. because its \"natural bodily function\" and he feels \"comfortable.\" Given, I was trying to be okay with it, but I find it kinda gross, unromantic, smelly, and rude, especially if we are cuddling or something to be interrupted by him ripping ass.At some point I was really stressed out from school, then he did it, and I scolded him about it and told him that if he needed to fart, to do it in our bathroom or in the dormitory hallway. He thought that was dumb, but a few times he's obliged.On one hand, I think it's right because he is in my living space and shouldn't do things like that that I have voiced to him several times that I find it revolting and gross (especially if its during an intimate time).

       "45424  My birthday was last week and I was disappointed with the \"party\" my friends prepared. To put you in perspective I much prefer simple but enjoyable and memorable things over something pompous, and all my friends know that.That's why I was surprised when the first thing they asked me was \"to dress a little bit fancy\". I was confused but I did anyway, afterall they knew what they were doing. Well, we ended up going to one of the bests restaurants in my city. I don't complain about that, the food was really good. Though I did tell my friends I thought this was a little bit too much and that I felt a bit out of place, but they said I deserved the best and we all laugh it off. I started to feel a bit disappointed when they gave me the presents, a pack of necklaces and a Disney t-shirt that doesn't even go with my general style. I wasn't sad because there were few things, I was sad becuase neither were things I liked. Another thing you need to know about me is that I don't like being con...   \n",
       "36180  So long story short, a couple of months ago a random cat started appearing at our front porch. We were concerned for him, but he seemed very well-fed and clean, so we assumed that he was just a wanderer since he only came around certain times of the day. We asked around with neighbors that we could find to see if anyone owned him. None of the neighbor's we could get in contact with knew about him. About a month ago, during a particularly cold night, he showed up on our front porch shivering. At that point, my housemate and I decided that we needed to take action. We took him to a local vet to be scanned for a microchip -- and lo and behold, he had one. However, it was registered to a phone number several states away and the number was now disconnected. From the microchip, we also found out the name of the owner and that she had adopted the cat in 2008. The owner had a very unique name, so we were able to find her on Facebook and get in contact with her. It turns out she had moved h...   \n",
       "55993  My sister has been vegan for many years and she is also raising her son vegan. He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. I usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. So basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home.

The only lighting comes in the form of 3 rows of fluorescent overhead lighting, which can be turned on/off one row at a time (this will be relevant). We’ll call this room A. There is an adjacent room with the same setup that I’ll call room B.Two of my roommates were up late working and had spread their papers, supplies, etc on the floor where they were working. Everything seemed to be quite scattered around. I had been trying to sleep, but was unable to because they had left the lights on. At 3am, unable to take it anymore, I asked how much longer they would stay up. They responded with 3h. I said if that was the case, then they should move to room B, because I wanted to turn off the lights in room A in order to sleep.They responded by asking if I could just put a towel or blanket over my eyes to block out the light. Up to that point, I had tried keeping the blanket over my head but took it off becau...   \n",

       "48447  My girlfriend is currently 8 months pregnant and it seems like the hormones are in full swing right now. She cries all the time and gets super upset/angry with me at least 3 times a week and I’m now at the point where when she starts crying at something she thinks I’ve done wrong, it just kinda pisses me off, and now rather than try and help her like I used to I have to leave the room and look after myself until I calm down and feel less angry.It’s always started off by something pretty minor. For example today we went to the kitchen to make dinner and while she was getting the chicken out of the freezer I started flipping through the calendar on the wall. She asked me to wipe down the kitchen counter which I did, except that I misunderstood.

Its not a long one but it is still a fucking fart and i find it disgusting. And thank god, it doesnt smell or else i wouldve exploded by now.But i really wanna tell him to stop. I know alot of people find it normal to fart infront of eachother and some couples find it funny too but no, i dont. I find it disgusting, ignorant and plain obnoxious.I just wanna know if ill it will be considered as a really disrespectful thing to say to him and thus result in me being the asshole.So WIBTA?   \n",

I have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. On Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away.

       "46984  For the past six months, my wife and I have unfortunately been long-distance after her job took her back to the States. Before she left, we made a mutual agreement with each other to respect the boundaries of our marriage and give each other comfort: no hanging out one-on-one with members of the opposite sex, and no large outings with members of the opposite sex if the event heavily involves or is centered around alcohol.My wife has unfortunately struggled to make friends since moving back.

My lease ended on June 1, 2018 and the landlord never returned my security deposit. My understanding is that the landlord has 30 days to do so or return a list of damages.Since it's been more than 30 days, I intend to sue for twice the amount of the deposit in small claims court. My problem is that I don't have a copy of my lease agreement. How can I obtain this from my landlord? Are they legally required to furnish a new copy to me upon request? If not, I might be SOL.Thanks,   \n",

       "21242  The title is pretty self explanatory. I work for a large, state run university. I work in a building that has classrooms as well as events and business open to the public (small café).There have been repeated issues with a person/persons shitting in the urinals in our building. The urinals in question are in a part of the building usually only accessed by students and professors, but anyone could theoretically walk in off the street and access.My workspace requires a swipe card to access, and apparently I have been in the building on the dates in question.Apparently the shitting incidents have been \"escalating\" (?!) and my supervisor asked me in a 1:1 to agree to submit to a DNA sample, and told me that it could be considered \"insubordination\" if I do not agree.They also told me that if I refuse, they will simply call the police and have them take my DNA since it would be \"suspicious\" if I refuse. Apparently others have agreed to give them their DNA, so I guess they decided to ask ...   \n",

The officer who issued it to me explained that it was not a major offense and that I should just plead guilty for the small fine as I have no previous record.I just had some questions about my court date. Will the judge ask any further questions about where I received the alcohol or any specifics? For the local court date are there any specific details I should know about my court hearing in order to shed light on other charges? If I do plead guilty to my specific charge, do I just pay the fine/consequences and go home?If anyone can shed some light to procedures I would appreciate it. I did not commit any other offenses, but am just wondering how complicated the court hearing will be.   \n",
       "19825  Long story short, we signed our rental agreement(not lease) for our new apartment 2 months ago. At the time, they pro rated us for the following month after move in. This came out to be $920, according to their calculations. We were under the impression that we were getting $300 of first months rents for a monthly special. Total rent is roughly $1200Yesterday, I called to ask if we could add my wife’s cat to the lease and they said that was fine. They re-did the rental agreement and sent it to us. This time they sent the pro rate of $1300, with fees. Wife freaked out, because we saved up just enough to cover what they said we needed on move in. We have emergency funds just in case. I called them out for changing it but they said that the last agreement was a mistake. Mistakes happen, I get that but we weren’t the ones putting the forms and numbers together. I told them that we signed and agreed on the first form and amount. The manager will get back to me.Our move in day is on Satu...   \n",

I'm going to try my best to articulate everything the best I can, and in the order they happened.At 7 PM I was out on my porch, reading on my iPad, when a single police officer,  I believe off duty, pulls into my driveway out of nowhere. He gets out of his car and begins very angrily pointing at my large Canadian flag hanging off my front porch. He immediately begins making accusations that it's the universal symbol for marijuana, and demands I give up my \"stash\".Seconds later he immediately escalates the situation by pulling me up by my shirt and placing me \"under arrest\" — and I say that with quotes because he did not use his radio at all, which I presume is not normal.After immobilizing me he tells me he is going to find the marijuana I'm growing, and enters my house.

       "42407  Hello, I am a college student in California. Myself and a group have been closing a deal on renting a house for our upcoming school year. We had signed a lease agreeing to a one year lease on which everyone in my group and the landlord signed. Just this morning I get an email from their agent saying they messed up when they put a one year agreement and have since changed it to month to month and just moved our signatures over from our previous signing. Is this legal for them to do? We didn't even get to read the new lease, they simply messaged us the PDF of the new document with our signatures from the previous document on them.For more information of the situation, we have not moved in nor has the old or new lease begun. We are set to move in August 25th so we haven't even hit the first billing cycle. We had all talked to them and expected a year lease as to guarantee we can't be given notice to leave for no reason randomly in the school year, and we had been told and then signed ...   \n",

I transferred internally within the company a year ago (with them 4 years total). When I moved to SD, I got some transfer bonuses totaling about $8,000. Due to an incident that occurred, I was forced to resign from the company (I was given the option of resign or be fired). I resigned, and now they are pressuring me to give back the $8,000 or they will send me to collections. The contract I signed DID state that I needed to work there 3 years(in San Diego) or I would have to pay it back, but do I have any options here? I know I'm in a bad spot, legally, but how enforceable are these contracts?I have good credit, and wouldn't want that compromised, but short of going to a lawyer or just ignoring it, do I have any other choices? What can I expect if I just ignore the request? I have no experience here and don't want to make the situation worse.thanks in advance.   \n",
       "51468  My previous post was removed for some reason and I was referred to tenant and land lord issues which this is not. My mother has always wanted to start a business since she left the school system being a teacher in the past year. After careful research and excellent planning, we had settled on a nice small store with a fairly reasonable rent and signed a lease. Unbeknownst to us, the property was apparently up for sale before we even signed papers. After 3 highly successful months into our one year lease contract, after hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on inventory to keep with demand, we are hit with a notice that the property has been sold and we are now devastated knowing we cannot move anywhere for the price we had negotiated. If we had known the property was under sale, we would of never signed a contract, we are wondering if there was any legal obligation for the owner of the property to notify us that we are signing a contract with a potential sale of the property h...   \n",

       "49139  Long time lover of cat gifs here, now I need some help.Me and my ex wife have a joint 50/50 custody agreement. But after having little luck finding work in the city after a layoff I took a temporary job out of town. Me and her made a verbal agreement that I would pay child support accordingly for watching my 4 year old full time while I'm away. She's currently on maternity leave after having a baby with her current partner anyways.The problem is, this job is going on longer then anticipated and she's upset about that. So she's trying to take away our 50/50 arrangement that we've had since we separated three years ago. She also is changing his school and daycare situation even though we both agreed on and registered for the ones he's in (going into kindergarten).So there's a couple things I'm curious about. First, if she gets a lawyer and wants to make changes to our current court ordered agreement does that mean I'll be served again? Second, is there any way I can stall things for ...   \n",

My wife and I are the other 75%, and would prefer to rent out the space. How does this pan out? It is a majority rules type situation and MIL can pound sand, or is it she is entitled to money invested only or maybe also equity as well? We all went in the house on a verbal that she can partner with us, partly to help out and partly to get a return when we sell. No formal write ups exist. Thanks in advance everyone.

       "49138  Long time lover of cat gifs here, now I need some help.Me and my ex wife have a joint 50/50 custody agreement. But after having little luck finding work in the city after a layoff I took a temporary job out of town. Me and her made a verbal agreement that I would pay child support accordingly for watching my 4 year old full time while I'm away. She's currently on maternity leave after having a baby with her current partner anyways.The problem is, this job is going on longer then anticipated and she's upset about that. So she's trying to take away our 50/50 arrangement that we've had since we separated three years ago. She also is changing his school and daycare situation even though we both agreed on and registered for the ones he's in (going into kindergarten).So there's a couple things I'm curious about. First, if she gets a lawyer and wants to make changes to our current court ordered agreement does that mean I'll be served again? Second, is there any way I can stall things for ...   \n",

I've sent two emails to their customer service email over the past 4 days and haven't gotten a response for either of them.

       "20453  We got a Cairn puppy last February from a breeding agency who has a fostering program. The gist is they gave us the pup for free on the condition we return her for six days of the year, every year, for breeding purposes. After 5 or 6 breeds, we're no longer required to do so. A contract was signed by both myself and a representation from the breeding agency. I dealt with a specific breeder but the contract is with the company, not an individual.The company dissolved in January and our contract doesn't mention anything about this kind of scenario. It's a very rudimentary contract which only covered what we need to do, the agency's responsibility for the pups health, etc. It makes no mention of things like \"we reserve the right to take the puppy back\" or anything like that.The individual breeder contacted me days ago asking for the puppy back, claiming we're only borrowing the dog and it's still her property.

We’ve let it air out for 2 days and the smell is still there. I’m just kind of worried since my other mousepad I got Corsair MM300 just reeked and we let it air out for months and it was almost like the smell was intended to be there and wasn’t going away. I’m just trying to do something so it doesn’t smell. Note, both mousepads have the same rubber smell, I’ve read posts were people talk about their mousepads smelling like fish but mine is just rubber.   \n",

Unfortunately I live in India so the newer Seasonic PSUs and EVGA PSUs are not available here. As an alternative, is the CX650 good ? It's the most reasonable psu for me budget wise but I don't know if it's good quality wise. Also, what is the difference between the Semi-modular one and the Modular one ? The modular one is around  2000 INR (40$) more than the non modular one. Should I be bothered with it ? I'm already a bit over budget so I won't be getting it unless it's really worth it.   \n",

Anyone that possible knows a fix?   \n",

We’ve let it air out for 2 days and the smell is still there. I’m just kind of worried since my other mousepad I got Corsair MM300 just reeked and we let it air out for months and it was almost like the smell was intended to be there and wasn’t going away. I’m just trying to do something so it doesn’t smell. Note, both mousepads have the same rubber smell, I’ve read posts were people talk about their mousepads smelling like fish but mine is just rubber.   \n",

I decided to pick up a used Asus Strix 1080, thinking my games would run great and I would be able to use this card for years down the road. Well I guess my CPU can’t handle some of my games with the 1080 and it bothers me a lot. I will get 200 - 300fps on csgo, sometimes going as low as 150, stuttering constantly — not smooth whatsoever. Before I had this 1080 I was using a 1060 6GB which worked great for lower end games, never had to worry about bottlenecking. My ram is 16GB 3000MHz running the XMP profile. My drivers are all up to date and same with my mobo. Is there ANYthing I can do to prevent myself from bottlenecking in this game? I know 200-300fps sounds like a lot, but when your 1060 6GB gets upwards to 300-400 steadily, it really makes you disappointed since you were expecting a breezy 400+ with the 1080. The only game I have had a great time with so far is Rainbow Six Siege. M...</td>\n",

The problem is I don't think the case I'm looking at come with front panel connector cables and the mobo I'm looking at only comes with 2 data data cables.Are there cables that I typically need to buy separately and if so can anyone recommend a place to go.I'm looking for2x usb 2.0, 1x usb 3.1, and the usual from panel stuff.Sorry if any of this is unclear as I'm new to pc building and not really sure what to ask for.Thanks for reading.   \n",

       "24528  So I’ve posted this one a couple other subreddits and I still haven’t found a solution to this. I decided to pick up a used Asus Strix 1080, thinking my games would run great and I would be able to use this card for years down the road. Well I guess my CPU can’t handle some of my games with the 1080 and it bothers me a lot. I will get 200 - 300fps on csgo, sometimes going as low as 150, stuttering constantly — not smooth whatsoever. Before I had this 1080 I was using a 1060 6GB which worked great for lower end games, never had to worry about bottlenecking. My ram is 16GB 3000MHz running the XMP profile. My drivers are all up to date and same with my mobo. Is there ANYthing I can do to prevent myself from bottlenecking in this game? I know 200-300fps sounds like a lot, but when your 1060 6GB gets upwards to 300-400 steadily, it really makes you disappointed since you were expecting a breezy 400+ with the 1080. The only game I have had a great time with so far is Rainbow Six Siege. M...   \n",

A law firm “Howard Lee Schiff” sent a letter suggesting that I send a check for the full balance. I’m a part time student with a fairly mediocre income that cannot immediately pay this off. I was thinking about calling and asking to arrange a payment plan, is this a bad idea? Should I write a letter asking for more information? Should I look into hiring an attorney? I’m completely new to this have no idea what my next move should be. I wish I hadn’t ignored it for this long and it’s stressing me out quite a bit, any advice is seriously appreciated.

They don't care what I do with the money once they give me the check. My student loan interest rate is about 5%. However, I don't have any emergency fund, and no savings. I do have $118,000 in my 401k, fully vested.My employer will match my student loan payments for two more years. I won't be out of student loan debt if I use the $10,000 to pay down my student loans in two years, but will have paid off about 2/3 of my student debt.Should I put the money into savings for my emergency fund, or should I use it to pay down my loans?

I lurk this sub and see a lot of advice being given so generously. I’d like to get some insight on my situation from others who know more than I do. Essentially I had a bit more than 40,000$ transferred over from a trust fund and set up with an adviser. This money was invested into 3 mutual funds, with fees/sales charges of 5.75%! Im down around 3800$ just from fees of selling existing stock and investing into three mutual funds. The fees seem astronomical to me, and when I sell i’ll pay those fees again. Seeing how I just lost nearly 10% of my investment on fees alone I’m beginning to question this whole thing. I should have asked better questions, but what shall I do going forward?25 years old, would like to use some of this as a down payment for a house in 1-2 years.    \n",

Could they use an FSA/HSA with Medicare? If they can't benefit from these resources, are there other options that may be available to them?Thank you!   \n",

I don't hate her, but I do wish she'd be less controlling. I just got my first credit report in the mail and discovered two accounts I had no idea I was a part of. I called my mom to talk about it, and she told me she had made me an authorized user when I started college. They aren't accounts for anything major- just an Old Navy card and a Walmart card. She's made on-time payments on them for the past two years, but frankly, I don't trust her with money. I know for a fact that she has a terrible credit score and makes purchases on a whim fairly often. I'd feel better knowing I'm not tied to her in any way.I'd like to know if my being an authorized user for these accounts is affecting me in any way, and whether or not it'd be smart for me to get my name taken off the accounts altogether.   \n",

Because of my sales performance I got a transfer to one of the busiest store fronts in Chicago but my pay rate is still $11.50 an hour excluding my commission. And my commute is about an hour from my house to the store, and an hour back. I talked to my assistant manager and he says on average everyone in our store get anywhere from a 15-18 an hour pay rate. What do I have to do to make sure I get the pay raise I deserve to be on par with my peers.   \n",

I lurk this sub and see a lot of advice being given so generously. I’d like to get some insight on my situation from others who know more than I do. Essentially I had a bit more than 40,000$ transferred over from a trust fund and set up with an adviser. This money was invested into 3 mutual funds, with fees/sales charges of 5.75%! Im down around 3800$ just from fees of selling existing stock and investing into three mutual funds. The fees seem astronomical to me, and when I sell i’ll pay those fees again. Seeing how I just lost nearly 10% of my investment on fees alone I’m beginning to question this whole thing. I should have asked better questions, but what shall I do going forward?25 years old, would like to use some of this as a down payment for a house in 1-2 years.    \n",

I am freaking out for her and want to help her get into the habit of putting away some of her income so she can build up some extra money passively but I’m not sure where the best place is for her to do that.She is an elementary school teacher in Texas and doesn’t make much money. She does tutoring for special ed kids and summer school teaching on the side to make some extra cash to make ends meet. I am her only family, and I’ve recently gone back to school to switch from an engineering career to a creative career (follow your heart, yay!) but with that said I am not sure just how much of a match to abundance I will be in the future.I am putting all of MY retirement money in a 401K because I’m 27, but she’s 57... so what type of fund would you guys recommend I set up for her?Any help is greatly appreciated!

I am freaking out for her and want to help her get into the habit of putting away some of her income so she can build up some extra money passively but I’m not sure where the best place is for her to do that.She is an elementary school teacher in Texas and doesn’t make much money. She does tutoring for special ed kids and summer school teaching on the side to make some extra cash to make ends meet. I am her only family, and I’ve recently gone back to school to switch from an engineering career to a creative career (follow your heart, yay!) but with that said I am not sure just how much of a match to abundance I will be in the future.I am putting all of MY retirement money in a 401K because I’m 27, but she’s 57... so what type of fund would you guys recommend I set up for her?Any help is greatly appreciated!

I have it set on a 10 year standard plan that at the end would accrue 3500 dollars in interest.I have been taking to people and I have 3 options that I am trying to simulate in my head and see which would be the best.1.

My second car I bought 3 years ago and it has a resell value of around 19000 dollars. I realize going to a dealership and selling it would take out a grand or two, so lets stick with 17000.

       "      <td>A few months ago I sold a home and am trying to figure out the capital gains tax liability.  I have the final sale price and purchase price (of course), but would like to know what I'm allowed to use for expenses (as I understand it, the expenses can be subtracted from the profit to reduce the tax base against which the 15% capital gains tax is applied.)  The home was a fixer-upper and required a lot of work when it was purchased.  What kind of costs am I allowed to use?  I'm pretty sure paint and repair costs are okay, fixture replacements are okay (like ceiling fans and doors), but what about things like furniture?  What are the rules?</td>\n",

       "35885  Written on mobile so excuse any typos.A friend, A, had her license test scheduled and wanted to brush up on her highway driving before taking the test. I figured at that point she’d be a good enough driver that nothing terrible would happen, and she promised if anything did, she’d pay to get my car fixed, so we spent a Saturday afternoon practicing. Turns out A wasn’t as comfortable behind the wheel as I’d thought. She was extremely cautious and things went okay for a couple hours until she took a turn too fast, overcorrected and just barely scraped my car against another. My car came out completely fine and the other lady’s has some very, very small scratches. Neither of us wanted to go through insurance so we exchanged information and she said she’d get an estimate and my friend could pay her back in cash (I know many of you are going to say we should go through insurance, but it really doesn’t seem necessary). It’s been 10 days and I haven’t heard back from her.At that point, we...   \n",
       "22917  Hello personal finance redditors, I am in need of some advice, 6 month ago I finally graduated college, and like most students I came out with loans on my name. Now my about before interest is 17000 dollars (not as much as some people but still a lot for me). I have it set on a 10 year standard plan that at the end would accrue 3500 dollars in interest.I have been taking to people and I have 3 options that I am trying to simulate in my head and see which would be the best.1. I have two cars, one is a old basic everyday car, not in the best condition but it works (worth nearly nothing, maybe upwards of 1000). My second car I bought 3 years ago and it has a resell value of around 19000 dollars. I realize going to a dealership and selling it would take out a grand or two, so lets stick with 17000. That would pay off the loan and I would never have to worry about the interest.My issue is all thats left is a car that I'm not sure how long it will last.2. Try to pay off the loans as much...   \n",

As to why I completed (and paid for myself) my undergraduate degree and didn't use these bonds-good question. While I want to, I'm not going to question why the bonds weren't used for my expensive undergraduate degree, all of the loans for which I paid off in 2018. I currently make $30,000/year. This fall, I will be entering a doctorate program at a school in the northeast. The school is offering full tuition and fee remission, health insurance, and a stipend of $23,000/year for the five years of my program. I must pay income tax for 3 years on the stipend. How can I use these Educational Savings Bonds, when I have none of the qualified expenses required to redeem them?   \n",

I was hired in at $14/hour USD. At the one year mark got my raise to $15.00/hour. This new posting is listed at $22 to $25 'depending on experience' on a recurting agency site. I'm due for a review in the next month or two. Since my last review I have a few more internal certifications as well. As a secondary series of questions, how do these agencies work? Do they get a cut of the salary? Does the company pay them till the 'contract' time is up or the hire the person on all the way? If the company won't match it, should I be applying for the job through the agency?    \n",

I am saving $5000 pretax to put aside for dependent care. This will be used for qualifying expenses reimbursement such as day care and day camp. But I also must pay for those first. So I essentially need twice as much money, at least the first year before I collect back the 5000. For example, if my child has 1000 for day care in October, then I have about 450 being taken out pretax, then I must also pay the 1000 in Oct and then in Nov I can submit for the money back.   \n",

I know I could pay this debt off in about a year and a half if I could get a balance transfer card and not have to pay interest on the credit cards. What are my options here? Would my chances be better if I sat down with someone where I bank and try and get a balance transfer card from them? I can't get approved for anything online due to my low credit socre and utilizing 98% or my available credit..  I feel lost.

My CA registration is due May 31st. I will not be driving the vehicle on any road from May 31 until June 3rd. Would there be any issues with getting the vehicle registered in Idaho if it is considered “expired” in California? I really don’t want to pay $300 for a year of driving in California that won’t happen, and am at 0% chance of getting caught (the vehicle will be getting transported to Idaho) Just don’t want headaches when it comes time to register in Idaho, and the DMV website doesn’t cover this.   \n",
       "47707  Hi folks,&amp;#x200B;I have 12k balance on 7 accounts. I have been playing with the thought of a personal loan but the APR rates are insane and borrowing 8k on a 5 year term I'd end up paying nearly 15K back to the lender. No thanks! I understand borrowing your way out of debt is not a good option but I feel like my interest charges are just eating me up and I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.. I know I could pay this debt off in about a year and a half if I could get a balance transfer card and not have to pay interest on the credit cards. What are my options here? Would my chances be better if I sat down with someone where I bank and try and get a balance transfer card from them? I can't get approved for anything online due to my low credit socre and utilizing 98% or my available credit..  I feel lost.

Because of this I'm only allowed to take undergraduate loans from Uncle Sam. I have to take private loans to cover the costs of school, but my parents won't cosign on my loan.Is there anyway for me to get a hefty private student loan without a cosigner?   \n",
       "38801  Throwaway b/c personal stuff. Thanks in advance for reading. In 2016, my salary was somewhere around $70k. I have a wife and two kids and my W\\-4 had just a few deductions, maybe 5 tops. I was also doing some day trading with about $25k in cash. I don't day trade anymore, largely because I barely eked out a profit over the year and a half I was doing it. That said, it's *entirely possible* that in 2016 I did make a few thousand, only to lose it again in 2017.
