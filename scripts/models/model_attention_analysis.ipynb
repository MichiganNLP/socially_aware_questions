I 'm getting a really good deal with the GTX 960 and now im thinking if i should save the money by getting an i 5 and getting an 1050 ti or it isn 't that much of an upgrade ?

Even if this girl WAS conceived before we broke up , I do not trust that I was the only guy she was sleeping with , as our relationship was fairly âĢ ľ open âĢ Ŀ and loose .

My daughter is 12 and has wanted one forever , but I âĢ Ļ ve held firm on it by not getting her one .  I âĢ Ļ m divorced .  My ex and I share custody .  He had her last week and got her an iPhone and put it on his plan .  I âĢ Ļ m pretty convinced that this is all just a passive aggressive jab at me because he knew I would either take it away or let him be the hero who finally got her a phone .  Well I stood firm in my beliefs and took it from her when she came home .   Of course she âĢ Ļ s furious with me .  Thanks ex .  She âĢ Ļ s barely talking to me .  Her point is that she hasn âĢ Ļ t even done anything and that it âĢ Ļ s not mine to take .  Her dad gave it to her .   \n",
       "620  am having an issue with my probation officer .  I had no luck going to this person 's superior for recomp ense . I  have been given a deadline that I cant possibly meet . The deadline was  to an alternative sanction in lieu of being brought up for a technical  violation . The violation is for breaking a rule of probation - The   vern acular used was you either accept the alternative sanction or go to  jail .  In the moment , I signed the paperwork agreeing to the alternative  sanction despite voicing my objections as to the timeline . Prob ation is  un sy mp athetic with respect to the concerns I have raised about the  timeline they have given me . Because  I am in a position where I am going to be unable to compete the task  within the time frame demanded - it was explained to me that if I fail  to do they will proceed with the violation hearing and bring me in front  of a judge to violate me .

       "77   know this has probably been asked a million times , but I still haven 't found a clear cut answer . For the sake of bre vity , my state 's law requires 48 hours notice . They hired contractors to do work on all of the buildings . I guess they needed to get in to do something . Fine , sure . The problem is there was NO warning . I 'm never home at that time , it was a one off occasion , and the reason I 'm annoyed because I woke up from a nap and a maintenance kid and another kid with the contractors were just in my place . I went for my gun . I was scared . I was also bare ass naked . After I got done yelling at the maintenance kid I talked to the contractor one ( I was cool with him , he 's getting paid jack shit to do this job ) and he said that 's how they 've been doing it with every unit . How do I know they don 't do this all the time ? All I want is to move out of this crappy cooperate apartment . I 've carefully reviewed the lease , and it 's a clear bree ch .

       "584  am a professor that lectures undergraduate courses in statistics and probability . A lot of the students that take my courses struggle because they 're not math / stats majors , and only take them because they 're required for social science or business majors . One of my students failed to show up to his final exam . I emailed him asking why , and he showed up at my office the next morning to explain . App ar antly he had come out as gay to his family the day prior and they reacted very poorly . He said he was too traumat ized ( his words ) to take my exam , which was his last . I asked him if he had a note from a mental health specialist and he said he didn 't because he just stayed home all day coping with his parents ' rejection . I told him I 'm sorry but that I can 't let him sit the final without a note .

       "954  my first granddaughter has a beautiful name . My daughter had cute names short - listed for baby girl two , I enjoyed the names , until she came across this other name . They decided to go with it . I hate the name . I told her nicely that I don 't like it . She loves the name , thinks it 's beautiful , and the girls will have cute similar names . She was really angry , and told me it 's their right to pick whatever name they want . I understand and respect that . I didn 't ask them to change their minds , or anything . I discussed it with my counselor who advised that I ask to find a cute nickname . My daughter was even more offended , said no , I have to call the baby by their chosen name . I can 't even use her middle name , which is nice . She went online for opinions to a moms ' group who supported her .

I have a GTX 1080 TI GPU and an i 7 âĢĳ 47 90 K CPU , so I would think that this would be powerful enough to handle most games on high settings . But I have noticed a lot of my games cannot run well ( 60 fps or higher ) on high or very high settings . It seems as if my cpu is bottleneck ing while playing graph ically intense games , such as Watch Dogs 2 . Here 's a screen cap that leads me to believe this : https :// imgur . com / a / iz T K 3 d 9 I don 't believe a CPU as powerful as mine should be performing like this though . One thought I had may be my liquid cooling unit I have on my CPU . Could this potentially be the cause of my CPU under performing ? And if so , is there a way to perhaps troubles h oot and fix it ?   \n",
