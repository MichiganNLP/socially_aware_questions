       "66  Sorry for the poor title, I didn't know what else to call it.Anyway, about 2 years ago my sister made an acquaintance from whom she bought a puppy.  Part of buying this puppy was submitting to a background check, to which the acquaintance said all she needed was my sister's address and legal name and that her husband would do the search.She thought nothing of it until a little while after when she learned that the acquaintance's husband worked for the emergency services contact center (911/C...   \n",

My employment contract reads that everything developed (software) at any time even on my own personal machines in unrelated industry/tech is owned by my employer.Is this enforceable in Massachusetts?

       "73  This last Thursday when we got our pay stubs I noticed I had a very large and unusual deduction. Now the store manager didn't give us the previous pay stub from 2 weeks ago.. so she ended up giving 2 paychecks pay stubs at once. On the older paystub it showed an advance of several hundred dollars, and the hours worked were significantly less than what it should have been (19 hrs were on there, I worked over 53 in that pay period). Because I was expecting a bigger paycheck I never questioned ...   \n",

The principal of the school said for $250 he would take me driving and would be able to take the test through him. He did not mention any details about anything, just told me to meet him at the school on Monday. So I went there, got in his car, paid him, he gave me a receipt and we drove for 90 minutes.

I am getting a $2,500 budget for stream upgrades alone. $2,000 is going to a tower, $500 towards audio upgrades. I built my own PC before, and I loved doing it. But with graphics cards sky rocketing someone told me it is cheaper to buy a pre-built pc? I do have access to a Micro center. What is the best bang for your buck at the current moment?    \n",
