67	How to get someone to stop pitying me?	"I just finished a difficult semester. A lot of things went wrong for me in my personal life and I realized that I didn't have any support system to get me through it. When I was at my most vulnerable, I tried to open up to a friend. They didn't really acknowledge it, but the dynamic of our friendship changed.For example, they recently invited me to a party, but they didn't really talk to me during the entire party and I found it hard to connect to the other people at the party who I barely knew. I felt very alienated and disregarded. In the end, they made several remarks that made me feel like they didn't respect me at all. Quite frankly, I found the whole thing quite patronizing and dismissive of my feelings.The thing is that I wasn't looking for pity when I told them how I was feeling. I just wanted to tell someone what I feeling because I felt totally alone with no one to tell. Plus, the pity is totally unwarranted because despite what I had to deal with, I did academically well this semester. I now also have a parttime software engineering job and a research position. I did that all by myself with zero help from anyone. I am not weak and I don't need their pity. I want to let know them that I didn't appreciate the patronizing comments, but I don't want to come off as disrespectful. I just want them to stop pitying me."

68	I had the chance to make out with one of the hottest chicks I've ever seen and I pushed her off of me because she was extremely drunk and I was sober. (17M)	"So me and my friends went to this crazy street dance and later in the night some chick points me out of my group of friends, stumbles over to the point where I had to catch her from falling, and than puts her hands on my face and goes in for the kiss. She was way out of my league and looked to be around 20 or 21, but way too drunk and me not drinking a thing pushed her away.I know I did the right thing but I do have some feelings of regret. My friends said if they had an opportunity with a girl that attractive they would have not even flinched at the opportunity. It was by far the most attractive chick to ever do something even close. I have so many mixed feelings and hope I can get some advice on whether I did the right thing or what you would have done in my position."

69	"Doubting which career path I should choose, need advice on how to make that decision"	"I'm about to reach that point where I have to choose what to do study and basically my future career.I'm doubting between fashion designing and building engineering.3 years ago I was sure I'm going to be an engineer, and made my parents to be all hyped about it. Then, few months ago, I started to learn sewing and I fell in love with it. My grandma was very excited and she would love to see me going to the fashion industry.On the one hand I'm not a mathematical person, not to the point where being an engineer is impossible, but it would not be easy.But on the other hand, engineers earn a lot, and at the end of the day we all need money. Plus it'll be easy for me to find a job. While in the fashion industry I'm not sure (and it's also very hard to succeed in this industry).Do you have any advice on which parameters I should focus on?"

71	"I want to move to pursue my goals, my fiance does not."	"I moved to California from Nebraska nearly 3 years ago to be with my current fiance who I have been with for nearly 4 years, we have gone through a lot together of course and have found new interest in life along with new career paths and goals.   However her heart and friends are here in California, mine however, is not.   I'm a very passionate reptile keeper and breeder, I keep various species of Monitor Lizards, Venomous Snakes and several of the largest snakes on the planet as well, however due to Californias laws, it prevents me from expanding and working with specific species I want to work with and pursue breeding and more.   Essentially, am I an asshole for wanting to move to a new state that will allow me to open the store I want to open, work with the animals I want to work with, at the cost of potentially leaving my fiance?   are my dreams and goals more important? Is it rational to pursue something I love, or stay in a state where I'm depressed and don't enjoy where I'm at in life due to feeling restricted from my goals.  I'm really just looking for simple advice on whether or not I'm being rational or am I just thinking of myself?   but also isn't my happiness and goals important to pursue?"

I really like her as a friend, and I think I'll have to let her stay if I want the friendship to remain normal. I'm not sure how many nights she'll be staying.

82	TNR Lady kidnapped neighbor's dog to teach him a lesson	"My neighbor is an old man, doesn't speak English, barely has any money, doesn't have any family. All he has is his Chihuahua. He's very sweet to her and sits outside all day with her. He lives on a side street and does not walk her on a leash and she doesn't have a collar on her either. Sometimes she will run out to bark but she always comes back.This lady who lives nearby traps and neuters cats and rescues dogs, will rehabilitate them and find them owners and asks for donations to finance this. At the moment she is living with over 30 animals in her house. Yesterday she saw the Chihuahua running down the street. She knew whose dog it was but was frustrated that he doesn't walk her on a leash or have a collar on her, plus he doesn't have money nor a car so he doesn't take her to the vet; she says her nails are too long and her teeth are bad. So to teach him a lesson, she purposely took her on errands before returning her to his owner at which point she found him crying, and she berated him. He gave her $20 to thank her for ""finding"" her.  I found all of this out because she posted it on Instagram bragging about it. There are a lot of poor Cuban and Haitian communities nearby and she likes to post about how she is helping these animals despite her ignorant neighbors' objection, and will often tag her posts with derogatory remarks. I will be taking the dog to the vet to help my neighbor.  **Should I call the cops on this lady? She is very nasty towards people who don't agree with her but I worry that the good she does for the community outweighs the negative things she does.**  *TLDR: Local lady who traps and neuters cats and finds homes for cats and dogs purposely kidnapped my old neighbor's dog to teach him a lesson because she doesn't agree with how he lets her loose and because her teeth and nails are unkempt. He is too poor to take her to the vet. He paid her $20 for ""finding"" his dog. She currently lives with over 30 animals in her home. Should I call the cops?*"	"If you live in a city/town, is there an alderman or other local government official you can notify?"	djslhz	Advice	1	0
83	I told my husband I'm depressed and I don't know if I've been horribly selfish.	"I've made a throwaway to feel a bit more secure about sharing this. I've been struggling for months and I completely broke down yesterday and told my husband I feel unhappy and like I just can't cope anymore and that I feel like I'm doing a really bad job raising our family. He has become sad in response to this (he was amazing for about 2 hours after I told him) because he said it's hard to see me like this and he just seems generally a bit ""off"" with me. I'm finding myself asking him if he's ok and needs anything and already just pushing my feelings down and slapping a smile on. I don't know what to do.

89	I'm moving into a new apartment complex and the original unit I had won't be ready for my move-in date so they gave me a choice between two alternatives. Do I take the top floor one or the second floor one with brand new floors?	The one we originally signed up for was also on the third floor because we preferred to not be on the ground floor. We like the idea of being on the top floor because that means we have no upstairs neighbors but it would also be cool to have brand new hardwood and carpet. Taking the one with the new floors would mean we would have an upstairs neighbor and might have to deal with their noise but would also mean a slightly easier moving experience. Should we stay with essentially the same thing as we had or go for the one with the new flooring in a slightly worse location?	How bad is the flooring upstairs?	c9pge6	Advice	1	1

My laptop is 4 years old and it's reached its end, super slow, crashes often and a real pain in the ass to edit videos, images and make websites. I've been trying to convince my parents that I need one for school, because I do but their response is to use the school computers, problem is, I don't have access to them each day, only 2 if my memory is correct. That leaves me with a total of 90 minutes each week to work on the assignments and they're all just as bad as my laptop, when I remind my parents about those facts they tell me to use my sister's computer, problem solved right? Unfortunately no, she needs her computer for school too and she isn't the most sharing person either. I tell my parents that I'll buy the computer with my own money and not theirs but they still say no, they also put my money in a bank account I have no access to until I'm 18.

My immune system is weak, which causes me to be sick a lot more than is normal. My parents constantly refuse to call school. They are either convinced I'm lying, or that it's ""not that bad"". I can't call them myself because I'm underaged. This means I have to cycle 30 minutes to school, stay at school for less than an hour so that I can report my illness to the person in charge. This forces my parents to call and confirm they know I'm sick. Then I have to cycle another 30 minutes back home.This fuss obviously doesn't help my being sick and turns my 3-days maximum sickness into one lasting a week or more. I hate this because I really don't want to miss this much school. I've tried talking to them but they won't listen.So I need some advice on what to do.

You can try this out and might like it. I have no interested in ANYTHING.

8	Asking a professor about his research even though I don't have the best grade in his class...	"So there is this professor who is teaching this one really difficult class that I have, but he is a leading expert in a field that I am really interested in, and I want to ask him about his research and potentially doing research with him. Now, it's not like I am failing his class, but I don't have an A either, and I am just scared because I feel like the students that a professor wants to work with or even talk about his research would be students that succeed in his class, the top students in the class. I am not one of those, but I am really interested in what he does, and I don't know how to go about this without him thinking I'm a complete idiot haha, the irony of this all is that I spent more time reading articles about what he does, than actually completing classwork..."

On the ride, she berated me for my behavior, told me I was totally wrong, and when I asked for a chance to give my perspective she flatly refused.

(heart defects)I do plumbing and heating for a living and clear about 28k a year. The apartment im looking at is like 425 a month (rural area if your wondering), and my only debt is my truck which i only owe like 6500 on and is paid off over a year ahead right now. I talked with my parents about it and they support the idea but think im being impulsive (which i am). But i feel like if i dont make a move i never will and im sorta self conscious about telling people i live at home yet. My other thing is im suck a introvert and i feel like having my own place might get me out more, i dont have many friends and stick to myself other then work so i feel like im becoming really anti-social and anxious. My question to you guys is do you think im being to rash or quick to jump and do this? Met with the landlords today and they seem nice, and like i said even though its nothing special is a good size for a single person.

27	Best way to evict a roomate that isn't even on the lease	"I moved into this place only just this month. When I arrived I was informed of two things by the current tenants. #1 there are two cats that live in the house and we aren't supposed to have pets. #2 My roommate Lily (fake name)  is not on the lease and is not supposed to be living here. At first I was kind of didn't think about it. However, as the days have gone by I have realised what a terrible set up this is. Lily was allowed to move in by previous roommates who no longer live there. From what I am being told Lily moved in around December and was supposed to move out in April, this never happened. Lily now says they will be gone by July. There are several issue. For whatever reason the previous roommates who allowed this decided since Lily is not on the lease she will pay for the houses wifi as her way to contribute. The wifi is $80 - $100 a month. Those of us that are legally on the lease are paying $500 a month for rent. As mentioned above, there are two cats in this housed. Lily was the one who brought the cats. Lily occupies the most fridge space, the most cupboard space and is the messiest. My main issue is that she is essentially living rent free when she shouldn't be. I want her gone and am tempted to tell the rental company that manages the property I live at but am hesitant as I am not sure what exactly would happen to the rest if us that have signed leases and are legally paying rent.

100	AITA for not going on vacation with my family	"So, I don't like going on vacation. Being away from home for a long time gives me really bad anxiety, on top of that I have insomnia issues and being away from home makes that 10x worse, plus I've had some pretty bad experiences on vacation as a child before. Honestly, I just hate it, and frankly I find it more stressful than enjoyable, between the logistics of the transport, lodging, navigating an area none of us are familiar with, and at the end of the day it's not really worth the trouble. A day trip to the beach or the lake, or six flags or something, now that I can enjoy. A week in Florida? I'd rather die, honestly. My ideal vacation is a week off work spent with my girlfriend hanging around the house and doing stuff within the city.I've expressed this to my family multiple times. A few months back my mom suggested the idea of a week in Florida over the summer. My father and sister were on board but I flat out told her my point of view and that I wouldn't enjoy it. She said ""well maybe you'll change your mind once it starts to get hot out"", told her it's not likely and that I'm not dedicating myself to such a trip, especially so far in advance.Fast forward to now and she asks if I'm ready for Florida next week. I tell her no, I'm still not interested in going. Her and my father then flip out on me, telling me they already paid $500 for me to go and that I'm being ungrateful. I told her I specifically said I didn't want to go and they shouldn't have spent that money. So after an hour long rant about how I'm unappreciative, rude, that I ""don't want to spend time with my family""(which I do, just not in Florida) etc.. they've decided to go without me and let my cousin take my place. Not that I would've gone either way.While I understand that this is an opportunity I'm lucky to have, and a lot of people would kill for, I don't think it's fair for them to force me into a week that would be incredibly stressful and unenjoyable for me.

101	AITA: Dad is livid because I asked him not to bring new girlfriend to my wedding	"Backstory: My dad is the type to constantly be in and out of new relationships. Lately they've lasted around a year. I find it exhausting to constantly be involved with new women, and have expressed that I don't care what he does, but I'd like to not be involved.Last night, my fiance and father had a conversation where we all agreed to place boundaries on the relationship between us and his girlfriend (this one's been about eight months) - namely that we would only have to be around or interact with her when it had to do with my sister (who is about 8 years younger). This is especially important due to our closeness in age with his girlfriend - my fiance has run into people she's gone to high school with that happen to be friends with this woman while we've been visiting my father and it's extremely uncomfortable. I'm getting married in about a month. My fiance is having a surprise bridal shower thrown for her on Saturday. Today, my dad texted me informing me that his girlfriend would be his date for the wedding and all wedding related events (including that she would be attending the bridal shower that neither my dad nor my sister or I would be, thrown for my fiance). I told my dad that we would actually appreciate it if he would attend the wedding solo so that he could focus his attention on being the father of the groom, as opposed to on his new girlfriend. Especially since none of the family have met her yet in the 8 months they've been together, and he is the type to likely go around introducing her to everyone, which I think is inappropriate to do for the first time at my wedding. He flipped. He's livid. My fiance and I think it's a perfectly reasonable request given his history and the boundaries we agreed to last night. He thinks he ""needs to fill the void beside him"" and us asking him to attend alone is the ultimate slight. He refuses to come without her, so we will probably cave and allow her to come.

"Not all, but most of the time I'm told a story or something that requires my attention for a few minutes or more, I usually end up drifting to another train a thought and completely forget the fact someone is talking to me. I did this to my grandfather last night as well as other times. He was telling me a story about his time in the Vietnam war, which I'm actually fascinated by, and he said something that made me drift off into another world. By the end of his story he asked whether or not I agree and I just took a shot in the dark and said yes. He didn't seem to notice that I wasn't paying attention and luckily saying yes worked. While I was off in another world, I was still making eye contact with him making it seem like I actually was paying attention. I feel bad because I do this more than I like to admit. If I hear a word that reminds me of a certain memory or story in my life, then i tend to lose focus on who's actually talking to me. So reddit, please let me know if IATA or not."	I'm sorry.......

She has some developmental disabilities, hates showers and washing her hands, but she still understands why she needs to clean herself and why it's important. These past few weeks, I've noticed that the underside of her fingernails are caked with dirt and who-knows-what. When she gets close, I get whiffs of garbage and sewage. I have no idea why she's not embarrassed by this, I'm sure kids at school have noticed, I've sent her to go wash her hands several times and it just doesn't work. Her mother will say ""oh, but her disabilities"" as though this is something she doesn't have to learn.Yesterday, I snapped and dragged her over to the bathroom. I showed her the soap and a nail brush and demonstrated how to thoroughly wash her hands. I refused to let her out of the bathroom until she'd scrubbed her hands clean to my satisfaction. She started crying and whining that I was being mean and unfair, but I was firm on it. Finally, after she scrubbed her hands several times, she showed me that they were clean. I said, ""That wasn't so bad, right? If you do it often it won't even take that long."" She nodded, I gave her a hug, and that was that. My wife came up to me and started screaming at me for imprisoning our daughter and treating her like she was a 3-year-old. We've had so many disagreements over this. I said that she was treated our daughter like a child for not enforcing rules just because she has some disabilities, and asked her if she wanted our daughter to grow up to be a functional adult or not. My wife said ""you abused and terrified her, if I was smart I would take her and leave"" and I told her if that is what she wants, fine, but I have our daughter's best interests at heart.AITA?"

Since I can't cook or bake, I mentioned in the group chat that I'd be bringing ham rolls. Alan responded to the message, asking what kind of ham rolls that I'd be bringing.

Second, I don't care if you don't eat them at the party, but saying you'd throw them away to the person making them is quite insensitive. I didn't respond to Alan in the group chat. I just let that go.&amp;#x200B;Fast forward to the party. Alan asked me about the ham rolls again. I casually told him in a joking way, ""if you don't really like pickles, then don't eat them...it's perfectly ok....I don't want to waste food."" He then said, ""wow okay.."" under his breathe and then walked away. &amp;#x200B;I instantly felt bad because it sounded harsh but that's not my intention at all. Because he did say he'd throw all my pickles away in the group chat and my mind was just unconsciously referring to that. But I didn't mean not to share it. &amp;#x200B;So, am I being the A-hole here for telling him not to eat my food?"	Just let him eat it how he wants to eat it?	9npynt	AmItheAsshole	1	0
106	AITA for skipping my sister's graduation?	"My younger sister is graduating from a very large university this weekend, and thus the ceremony is split into two days: Friday was the general commencement, Saturday (today) is where each college within the university holds their own ceremonies and the diplomas are handed out.My parents live overseas in S. Korea and flew in a few days ago to the US for her graduation. We all attended the Friday ceremony, including me, and I could tell my parents were pretty mad at me as they seldom talked to me.The reason is because I told them two weeks ago that I would not be attending the Saturday ceremony as my best friend and I had organized an overnight trip to Death Valley. My best friend is moving to the UK next week for his new job and long story short could only find the time for our trip during my sister's graduation weekend.My parents were understandably upset when I told them two weeks ago, saying stuff like how I could choose friends over family, but I thought they would eventually cool off before we all got together yesterday, so I was surprised that they didn't. My younger sister on the other hand is perfectly fine with my choice."	Did you talk to your sister about it?	c0x6yl	AmItheAsshole	1	1

108	AITA for removing my coworker's food from the microwave after he did the same to me?	So I'm heating up my food in the work microwave. The microwave only goes to 3 minutes and my meal needs 5. So I put it in for 3 minutes and go to my office across the hallway. So the microwave beeps and I hear someone open the microwave and restart it. I was a little frozen in shock. People here don't usually touch other people's food in the microwave. It usually just sits there until they come for it and people wait. I get up and go in the kitchen and someone else's food is nuking. I got a little offended and pulled their food out mid-run and put mine in for the remaining 2 minutes. Well the culprit comes in while I'm doing that and we have this passive aggressive conversation. Me: my food needed more timeHim: well why didn't you come in when it beeped?Me: I did. My office is across the hallway ...awkward standing around in the kitchen...Me: guess it'll be nice when we get the 2nd microwave in here...awkward countdown continues...I grabbed my food when there was 30 seconds left and ran.

109	WIBTA Talking to a Friend About Her Weight	"I have a friend that has gained a lot of weight in the past few months. Part of it is definitely stress and I know that she is having some health issues with her thyroid too, but she also doesn't seem to be making any effort to make healthier decisions for herself. I don't want to make her feel any more self conscious than she already does, but I do think that she could be taking some steps to at least start getting back to a healthy weight.

110	AITA for completely ignoring a friend I once pursued	"There comes a time in a man's life, at least for those who are not good with girls, when one realizes something is seriously wrong with their dating game and they have to go fix it. After losing weight, reading fashion, psychology self-help, and *killing* neediness I was able to lift myself up... except all this happened because of a female friend who rejected my romantic advances (""eww no"" actually stings more than you think).Fast forward to half a year later, I'm at this casual work conference. Lots of people shaking my hand, lots of compliments. Out of the blue, I hear her voice call my name... she has a hand raised rather enthusiastically to high-five as if we're close (we *were* close, in a sense, long ago when people teased we were a couple). And I just... I walk past her.And it felt *soooooooooo* good. More than the sum total of girls I approached this year combined, the phone numbers, the rejections I braved to become a better man and learning how to move on. She was the epitome of the dating life I wanted to leave behind: nice guy texts she eventually stopped responding to, driving her around, having platonic lunch together. She was the final straw that cracked my nice-guy dating paradigm. It made sense to just fade away and have some self-respect... so greeting her a happy birthday (months ago) was the last thing I ever did before we just kinda stopped being friends.I didn't even have a smug face on, I just took the coffee I ordered at the nearby stall and continued walking.

This person is a great, solid, give you the shirt of their back kinda person. When it comes to food I'm a very very picky eater. The other issue is that the house is, dirty. Constantly. Really dirty. I try not to be too judgemental because of the medical conditions (fibromyalgia) and the fact that him and his wife are much older than I am (mid 60's compared to my late 30's).I always refuse with some excuse or another, but last night they had food they know is something I really like. I did a big favor for them earlier in the day, and they wanted to show appreciation for it. At first I agreed to stay for dinner, then later after seeing the kitchen again, I came up with another excuse for not staying. This time, they didn't buy it.

Lo and behold, she got attached after they stayed more than twice the initial time. She's super bummed out and may not be able to adopt them both, as she wants to keep them together. Her landlord made a special case for her to foster them and it may not stand for the rest of the lease.&amp;#x200B;I just found a site (and I'm sure there are other ones) that you can put a picture of your pet on some custom socks. I was thinking one of these for Christmas but am afraid it would really bum her out and ruin her holiday. Socks have a bit of a special place in our relationship but I still don't want to bring up the hurt of her having to give them up.&amp;#x200B;Note: She has to make a decision by Thursday so I guess if she does keep them, it's a pretty cool gift.

113	AITA for not wanting to hear about my best friend's relationship problems anymore?	"My best friend is a great person, but she could really use some work with picking good partners for herself because the past countless relationships of hers (including this one she's in now) are always the same: she meets a guy she barely knows, starts dating him shortly after, gets into problems with the guy, vents to me about it and vows to end the relationship when really the cycle just continues until the relationship miraculously ends and she gets with another guy in the same manner.      To be fair, almost all of the situations she gets into aren't her fault, as the dudes she dates always screw her over, but after seeing this happen every single time with every single guy she dates, I'm starting to think that this really is all her fault for not learning from her past experiences and not sticking to her preferences (or just not date anyone crazy). I've become mentally exhausted from hearing her vent about the same relationship problems all the time, but she comes to me because she wants my opinion on what she has to say, and she's my close friend, so I feel obligated to hear her out. I've also been tired of giving her advice only for her to do nothing with what I've told her. I don't expect my advice to be followed or anything, but it's frustrating when she's always asking for it and following up with ""you're so right"" and promising that something will be done when really nothing does happen.This dilemma has made me wonder about the purpose of advice giving, and it makes me feel bad for being tired of listening to the same thing all over again when it's my best friend.

115	AITA for eating a lot at a wedding buffet?	"I (17M) eat a good amount of food. Based on my body type and physical activity, I've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.My aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. It was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/DJ meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.This was problematic because I needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as I had only been excused for the morning one. I ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. I only ate a protein bar during the drive, so I was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.I loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. I was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. She had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if I was still hungry I could make something when we got home.Now, I would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. I ate a good amount, but I doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.She eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. I would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. There was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.Once we left, my mom went on a rant about how I was ""making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day."" I told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and I wasn't depriving anyone else since I went back for more once most people were done.I'm not sure if I violated some social norm, but I feel like I was justified. AITA, Reddit?EDIT: I don't know if this matters, but I was mainly eating chicken and lamb, not veggies or rice/bread. There was still some leftover, though."

I asked him to please not post pictures of him either and so far he has been nice enough not to do so.  The problem is that I found out his wife is posting pictures of my son. I know to some it might seem ridiculous but I want to know if I would be the asshole if I told him to please tell her to take  them down. I'm just very protective over our privacy and the people we surround ourselves with and not posting pictures is part of that.

About a month in I could see him starting to lose focus of her, he had a full time job. And I would help with the basics, feeding and taking her out etc. Then he got another part time on top of his full time. I told him it wasnt a good idea since he already spent minimal time with the dog. Eventually I ended up doing most of the caring for the dog, and he realizes he has to get rid of her but constantly changes his mind about it. I've stopped looking after the dog because the more I do the less he does. So there are days where I feel the dog is neglected. Is it wrong for me to do that? I feel bad mostly for the dog."

119	"AITA for not trusting my ""roommate"" and then going through his phone?"	"I've been letting a friend of mine who fell in a rough spot crash with me for the past couple of months. I otherwise live alone. It hasn't been terrible for the most part. He offered to help out around the place and I only asked for money once with the idea being that he save up to get a place of his own (he has a stable job, just needs to get on his feet.) But then as I think is usual in ""new roommate"" situarions, little things keep coming up like using my stuff without asking, begging me to buy him cigarettes, and the apartment smelling like weed when I come home after 10-12 hour shifts. I have absolutely nothing against weed, I just felt it was disrespectful and told him that directly, same thing with going through and/or using my stuff without asking. After all that, I also found out he had one of my neighbors (who I've never met) over in my place without me knowing, when I clearly stated before that I'm not cool with someone I don't know in my apartment. He swore up and down that it was just for a beer and a movie, and I did believe him. Even so, I gave him the deadline of a full month to be out already because it became clear that the situation wasn't working.Tonight, I let the feeling of slowly deteriorating trust for this person that I consider to be a friend get to me. I ended up looking through his phone, and of course, in his gallery, found a video of him sucking some dude's dick in my bed from a full week prior to the aforementioned neighbor incident. I feel horrible for going through his stuff, especially since he's in the process of getting out, but also bad that I confirmed my feelings of mistrust and like I was disrespected. I'm conflicted about whether or not I should say anything and expedite the moving-out process, or just chill out and let it run its course.

Our great grandmother passed away 8 months ago and she left a 91 Honda Accord for me to have and pay for the insurance and gas upon me getting my licence. Last night, my brother snuck out of the house and took the car for a joy ride with his friends and in the process got in to a car wreck that totalled the car, and had had the accident happened a few seconds too early or too late would have killed him. I have been unable to stay in the same room with him nor be able to say more than a few words to him since. My mom is overcome with the thought of what might have been and wants me to talk to him. As thankful as I am that he is still alive, I feel angry. I feel like he took something promised to me and destroyed it with his carelessness. Worse still, I fear that this didn't really change anything for him, and that he's still gonna have the same arrogant mentality.

I told him I didn't want to talk about it in front of Ex and while we were at A's birthday. He said we could talk about it later and that he was there for me.Later that night I couldn't sleep because I was really sad so I sent A a text. It was late. Like 4:30 in the morning:""K and I broke up and I'm really sad about it. I'm also really scared. I'm worried about so many things and I feel like crying all the time. I'm not sure if I'm making a terrible mistake. I think this will be good for both of us but I'm not sure. He'll be able to find someone new to love and who will love him. I think I'm too broken for anyone to love. ""Today (3 days later) I get a Facebook message from A's girlfriend (GF) which was both rude and threatening. GF saw the text that I sent to A. A told the GF that I'd tried to make out with him before (I've never tried anything with him) and she threatens to go to my Ex and our friends with the desperate text.A said that he doesn't want me to feel like I can't talk to him about stuff. He also said that late night texts can be misconstrued. I asked him if he would be able to tell me when I tried to make out with him and asked him to stop lying about me. He hasn't gotten back.Am I the Asshole for texting a friend late at night when I was sad and needed someone to talk to?  Did I come across like I wanted to hook up?  If your SO got a text like that from someone of the opposite gender that they've been friends with for 10+ years how would you react?  I don't think I was inappropriate but maybe I'm wrong?"

135	AITA for blocking my ex-girlfriend after moving to another country?	"When I was 15 I had a girlfriend that I had been dating for 6 or 7 months. However that year my dad got transferred to Europe and so I moved with him over the summer. For a little context, this girl was my best friend and we pretty much spent the entire summer together including when she came to my grandparents' house in Florida for our last week together.Before I moved we had talked and I had decided that we should probably break up because long-distance relationship as 15-year-olds, in my opinion, wasn't feasible. She agreed with me but she seemed on the border between wanting a long-distance relationship and breaking up.After I moved we kept in contact as friends and face timed very frequently but we had 'officially' broken up. After the first two months at my new school, I hadn't really transitioned well and was feeling depressed throughout the school day and then I would immediately head home to talk to her. I thought that the reason I wasn't very happy was that I still had a very strong connection to my life in the US through my ex. Around the same time as I started realizing how unhappy I was my ex started dating someone from my old school who I knew.  The combination of her getting a new boyfriend and not being able to move on from my past school life and commit myself to my new social life lead me to decide that I was going to cut off my contact with her, so I talked to her about it and then blocked her.

Changed names and tried not to include too many details as I know the guy in question is a redditor too.&amp;#x200B;George and I have been friendly for a while now, and been hanging out more regularly at lunch time. Since I'm a very quiet person who doesn't make friends easily, this has been a welcome change in my work life.All went very well, until he started making fun of my accent. (I'm an immigrant to his country).  At first I took it as a joke, went along with it, but then it started to be more frequent and more unpleasant. He started doing it in front of other people too. I did tell him I don't like his jokes and I find the situation uncomfortable, but he didn't stop.I slowly stopped hanging out with George, tried not to speak to him unless necessary to give me some time to think about this, figure out a way to let him know he's been rude to me.&amp;#x200B;A few days later he sent me a text and asked why I'm not talking to him anymore. I replied I don't mind talking to him, but he's hurt me by constantly making fun of my accent. Also let him know I have negative feelings towards him, I was merely confused.He gave me a non-apology, ""sorry you got offended"" and then proceeded to make a point of avoiding me at work. He acts like I don't even exist, looks away when I walk by, etc.It's been almost 2 weeks and he still seems to despise me, I don't know if I should apologise or let it go.&amp;#x200B;My question is, was I an asshole for being offended over his jokes?I'm not really a social person so I have no idea if I handled this situation poorly.

137	AITA for not wanting to get my hair and nails done for my mom's wedding at a salon and just do it myself?	"So my mom is getting married on V day next week.. she asked me what I was going to do to my hair. I told her I wanted to do it myself and had a certain style in mind. She insisted that I go to the Dominicans and have them wash, blow dry, and straighten it. I wasnt really wanting to do that because my hair is slightly damaged from the micro braids I had in a couple months ago. And I was just trying to stay away from heat for a while. She said she just wants it to ""look nice"" as if I dont know how to do my own hair I guess lol idk. She said it's just for that day and I can wash it and do whatever to it after the wedding and she would pay for it (I'm not working right now so money is tight on my end) but I'm just like I really dont want her to spend her money on something that's only going to be for one day, especially when she has better things to worry about.. then my grandma asks me what i'm doing about my nails. I told her I brought my own nail polish and will do it myself. She then says the same thing my mom said about looking nice and she would pay for them.. I'm just like üò™üôÑ I'm a 21 year old woman, I know how to do things myself without spending money on it if i have the necessary tools to do so which I do.My question is, am I the asshole for feeling this way?

138	AITA for giving a girl a toe massage in front of my girlfriend?	"My girlfriend(f25) and I(m22) went to a party last night with some of my friends from high school. It was fun and a quite chill night, but everyone started to get drunk. Two more girls from my high school came a little later and I introduced my girlfriend to them. While my girlfriend, one of the girls and I were chatting the friend hit her toe on the table and I felt bad for her and gave her a awkward little toe massage while I said poor you. The toe massage as I like to call it is nothing sensual, but rather one that your mom would give you if you got a booboo.A little backstory with this female friend of mine. While I exited a relationship 4 years ago I got lonely and planned to hit on this girl, without actually doing it. This was in hindsight because I was lonely and she was avaliable, but I didn't really like her. I told my girlfriend that. At the time of this 5 second long toe massage I didn't think of it in a flirty way as she is a good friend of mine, but my girlfriend exited to the balcony in anger.Girlfriend and I ended up having a fight because she thinks I tried to flirt with female friend in front of her. Her argument is that I wouldn't have done it to any of my male friends, and I do agree that I wouldn't as it would be weird.I think the reason my girlfriend is a bit more vulnerable to my behaviour is because I had a one-night-stand about 5 months into our (back then) long distance relationship, around 2 years ago.AITA for giving a slightly awkward toe massage to a friend of mine?"

139	AITA For not continuing to talk to a girl?	"So, this happen a little while ago but I started thinking about it.My friend set me up with a girl. The girl and I started talking and eventually set up a movie date over the weekend. Our plans were really last minute and convoluted and she ended up texting me saying she had some things to do but she would try and make time. She didn't get back to me so I assumed she was still going (where I messed up). I texted her ten minutes before the movie was going to start asking where she was. She said she couldn't go.We decided to meet up during lunch break later in the week. I was really excited to actually hang out with her. I texted and asked where we should meet up and she was really confused until I reminded her that we were supposed to hang out. She said she needed to make up some schoolwork so I didn't care too much that she cancelled. Twenty minutes (lunch is an hour) into lunch my friend, the one who set us up, told me the girl was hanging out with her friend. This hurt me.I confronted her about this and she said that she wasn't trying to avoid me or hurt me and that she would tell me if she didn't want to see me.

140	AITA for spending money on myself and not buying bday presents for my family?	"My stepmom has a pretty big family. Her sister, niece, father and I all have birthdays in August within a week of each other so usually one big party is thrown for us and we all open gifts.Now I'm in a weird spot in my life. I'll be turning 24 this Friday. I just moved into my first apartment with my boyfriend and am still adjusting to spending this much money on rent/utilities. I'm paying of A LOT of credit card/student debt that accumulated from a lot of circumstances, but now that I have my first decently paying job, I've been making progress paying it off and I'm really proud of myself. However money is still a little tight for me.Knowing this I asked my stepmom if I could contribute a little bit to a gift for everyone together because I didn't feel I could afford to get everyone something. She said not to worry, she would put my name on what she got them and it would be a ""family gift."" And that was the end of it.I have been saving a little money but after the party I ended up spending a pretty decent chunk of change ($100) on a high end pillow because I have neck/back problems and keep waking up unable to move my neck. I also spend money ($64) on skincare stuff because my skin is really sensitive and I was having a hard time finding cheap stuff that worked for me.I feel really guilty spending the money I saved on myself and not buying birthday presents for my family members. My cousin is planning her wedding in Cancun for next year, which I know is expensive for her and she's on a budget and she still bought everyone something. AITA for doing this? I asked my boyfriend and he said no, I saved up and bought things for myself that will make me comfier and I didn't waste it on anything frivolous. I just.. feel guilty."

141	WIBTA for ditching a film project that is an absolute train wreck?	"Hi,So a bit of context. I'm a young director (22) who recently was approached by a really talented guy (Cine) to direct a short film. The job was unpaid - I would very rarely take unpaid jobs, however I was interested enough by the script to jump on board and put some of my time into the work.Unfortunately for me, the producer is incredibly difficult to work with. He refuses to do anything - whenever we need to make contacts, or get in contact with anyone, he will tell people he has done it when he simply hasn't. Time was running out in the short pre production schedule, and he still hadn't found a production designer, sorted costumes, props etc or realistically done any of his jobs.Cut to yesterday. I have worked with actors, done shot lists, rewritten the entire script repeatedly refining it and making it understandable, done a variety of storyboards and blocked the entire thing out. That's when I hear that my actors, who were supposed to liason with my producer have literally never even heard of the guy. Massive red flag. And one of the actors said the only thing from the producer they'd been told were the dates - the wrong dates. I was furious. I spoke to him and he full on lied to me saying he did speak to them and he just changed the subject when I provided evidence he hadn't. We have a ¬£50,000 camera on rent directly from Sony, lots of equipment, but nothing else. The only person who hasn't done their job is the producer. Now, I am being asked to fork out ¬£100 to pay for travel to a location I was told would be paid already, and we have literally nothing sorted, no costumes, no power, no props, no extras, nothing. We need these things.Would I be in the wrong to simply say enough is enough and drop out? I'm not being paid and now I'm paying out of my own pocket for this project. I've done all my work and more, but the producer is simply unable to do anything. Now he is refusing to even show up to set."

143	WIBTA if i kicked a ‚Äòfriend' out of my social group?	"So to give some context. R started to hang around with me and my friends after she left her old friends. She was nasty to her old friends and they snapped one day after she purposely hurt one of them thinking she was being funny. She just sat with us one day for lunch and sat silent for about a week. We kind of tried to join her in although not overly tried since she just sat down and didn't make any attempt herself. She slowly began to talk to us after a couple weeks but didn't really understand half of the things we were talking about since we have barely anything in common. We didn't want or need anyone else in our group because it was pretty good and we were just the right number. Once she got more comfortable with us she started being different. She slaps us on the arm hard to get out attention and pushes us around. She said some hurtful things to one of my friends about her dead brother and is kind of bullying a kid with autism (although she didn't know he had autism until about 2 weeks ago). She is really quite annoying and doesn't seem to understand her place, thinks it's okay to be rude to people because ‚Äòwe are her friends'. She admitted that she used us completely so she didn't look lonely the whole time. Does it even count as a friendship if she was using us the whole time? We never really liked her anyway but after she admitted that it just seems like she never actually wanted to be our friend for the sake of being friends but because she didn't want to seem lonely.

146	AITA for asking my friend for help?	"Useful background info for this story: friend is half Native American, I'm half Asian. We've been friends since we were 4-5 years old. Earlier this semester, my mom found what seems to be a Native American decorative arrow in a Goodwill. It's framed quite expensively, so she thought it might be worth something if it's legit. After Google failed her, she asked me for help on finding someone to look at the piece and get us in touch with an appraisor if it's legit. I find nothing on the arrow, call some appraisers and they don't know the slightest thing about Native American art and artifacts, and I'm at a loss. This is when I remember that my friend recently interned at a small Native American museum, and might have an idea as to protocol with this thing, or might be able to get in touch with her old boss and see if they know anyone qualified to look at it. So, I text her and ask if she might know where to start with this thing, as I have no idea. I thought this was a perfectly fine thing to do as she had experience in a museum who probably sees stuff like this more often than your average person, but apparently not as she got upset with me for asking her because she's Native. I tried to explain that I didn't ask because of her ethnic background but because of the museum experience but it backfired on me and says that I hurt her even asking in the first place, and trying to justify myself was making it worse. I'm not denying I hurt her feelings, and I did apologize and ask for ways I could have better handeled the situation or worded the question, but was left with a ""whatever."" I hate to say it, but was this an overreaction on her part? It's not like I sent her pictures of it and asked her to identify it or appraise it - I just asked where I might find those leads from the most likely person I know to have them. AITA?"

And at one meeting where management commented on her output, resulting in her having to use EVEN more time to do it. So she asked if i could take over a process, which took about 1 hour per week. I was taken by surprise and pity came over me so i agreed. On hindsight i shouldn't have. Ever since then, she had been trying to push more and more of her jobscope to me. It would be fine if it was a once off favor but she is basically trying to offload a few regular processes to me. I am responsible for the results of the team and if she is tardy, we cannot hit our KPI, i'm the one who has to face the music.

So we emptied the flat, replaced furniture that had been damaged (cats had plucked couches so bought 2nd hand couches to replace them. They were a better make and quality but they were 2nd hand and slightly worn). Flat wasn't spotless but was clean. I had a call today saying they are so disappointed, they trusted us, they cant believe we have left it in the state that we have done etc etc. Their words: There is some paper under the bed, the table falls apart when you put something on it (we never had a problem) couch is such a mess (we replaced used for used) there is a stain on the carpet, nails still in the wall (that I agree with but I couldn't reach without a ladder and they were re-decorating so didn't think it would be too difficult to take a few tacks out while they were already up there). We have paid them roughly ¬£20k in the time we were there so I think decorating, a new carpet (or a carpet clean) and paying for a deep clean isn't too bad of a deal for them! We replaced the broken washer with a brand new one - now 6 months old, found a new private tenant (saving them thousands in letting fees) and taken items to the tip that they asked us to.

150	WIBTA for asking fellow subway passengers to move so that I can sit down?	"So, I'm 8 and a half months pregnant, and I ride the subway to and from work every day. For my entire pregnancy, the subway has been a particular trigger for me: I get frequent low blood pressure attacks on the subway, including nausea, light headedness, and feelings like I'm going to faint. A couple of times I've needed to crouch near the ground just to keep from keeling over. Luckily, since I've become visibly pregnant, I've had generous subway passengers offer their seats about 80% of the time. Sometimes they don't, and that's fine - that's their choice. But when they won't move out of the brightly colored chairs that are specifically designated for pregnant women, people with disabilities and people with babies,  I do get kind of annoyed - However, I've never demanded that someone move because I am aware that some people have invisible disabilities and I don't want to embarrass anybody or call anybody out publicly.Now that winter has arrived, I'm often wearing bigger coats, which means people cannot tell that I'm pregnant and will rarely give me a seat. This has been especially bad since the 8-month stage, because my constant sick-feeling is being aggravated by my increasing size. I'd like to ask people in the bright-coloured seats to move (there's no way they can ALL have invisible disabilities) but I don't want to be an asshole. What should I do? Additional Info: I take cabs when I'm too sick to ride the subway, but it's too expensive to be an everyday option."

We were packing up to go to the neighborhood pool and I had been playing with them by bumping them with the floats as I loaded them in the trunk where they were sitting. I had loaded them on top of them kinda, playfully. I than turned the corner to grab something and I thought I heard one of my two kids kicking the floats out of the trunk, but definitely hitting the driveway. I told them to pick them up and load them and my 8 year old said they fell out, my 5 year old says he kicked them out. Without seeing it myself I couldn't be 100% sure but given that I thought I heard them being kicked out and my daughter attesting to him kicking them out, I am relatively certain.

153	AITA for not feeling the same way towards my niece as everyone else does?	"The day my niece was born, I was obviously excited. But that was it, just excitement and curiosity. I didn't really feel love. I hadn't addressed the thought until I heard my other sister (not mother of niece) talk about how everytime she sees her, she's filled with a sense of love.Now, she's about a year old, and everyone in my family talks about her so endearingly. I wanna clarify that I don't feel jealous of the attention or anything like that, I just genuinely can't relate to what they say about her. I don't feel any connection to her past the obvious ""Aw cute baby"" feeling. And I can never grasp conversations about her either. Like, I don't understand how they can all talk about her so long because I just get bored immediately. Our family group chat is just full of pictures of her and then people proceeding to send many, _many_ heart emojis, call her cute, etc. It also isn't that I'm trying to act all cOoL and eDgY by not liking a baby, I just sincerely can't relate to how everyone else feels. And I feel really bad about it. I always try to interact with her, but it comes off as awkward and forced, which makes it obvious that I don't really want to be doing it. That, of course, makes my parents quite frustrated, especially when the baby's calling out for specifically me.I really wish I could relate to how my family sees my neice because, well, it feels like when people are referencing a movie you've never watched, and you try to keep being in the conversation with no knowledge of what they're talking about. It also seems as if this feeling is going to keep being there as I become older and reach the age of having children. That's going to be a major cause for me being a black sheep in the family (my family's pretty gossipy and throughout the years, I've heard various comments about other people along the lines of ""I don't understand how they don't want children, seems crazy to me"").

In that same day he went to universal and I had to do the rest of the work.

It wasn't much, just a charger he said he needed and a gift card. Nothing compared to what he'd gotten me for my birthday a month prior.

Just using her new freedom to her advantage. For Christmas I got her a few cute good quality nose rings from the piercing place I purchase my jewelry from (I also have my nose pierced, as well as my septum and a lip ring) and some tattoo lotion she asked for since her artist recommended a special one because her skin was reacting sensitively to the one she was usingMy mother in law watched her open it and went essentially said""I really don't like the rings. I think studs are so much classier. I also really hate your tattoo. I think tattoos are ridiculous"" I ignored her and told my sister in law I would take her to the place I went to to change her nose ring, since it's easier to get a professional to do it until you are used to changing it. My mother in law said ""No you won't, I don't like the hoops."" I told her ""Well, she does and it's her face. She's 18, if she wants to change her piercing, she can."" And that was the end of that. Later I texted my mother in law about New Years plans and she told me I wasn't welcome in her home until I apologized for being so rude and disrespectful towards her. I said I was sorry she felt I was rude if she felt disrespected, I was just defending sister in law and her right to do what she wants, and she blocked my number and told my husband I was the rudest person. My husband thinks I should have just left it alone and taken her to do it without interacting with mother in law, but I felt it was important to show my sister in law she had a supporter and someone who would defend her, but now think I was excessively rude.

We've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that.

She went on a rant about how selfish and inconsiderate I was and just a bunch of horrible things before hanging up on me.Theres a few reasons I dont think its a big deal...- Hysterectomies are pretty routine. Theyre serious sure but very rarely fatal, and it definitely has a low complication rate for a woman thats already menopausal.- Im still texting and calling her with support daily. I dont really understand why I need to be there in person if shes just gonna be unconscious for hours.- Im ridiculously exhausted. I would probably sleep through everything anyway.- Im sick.

I am planning on waiting until my review and receiving my bonus before I start aggressively pursuing a new job with more career advancement opportunities and hopefully a higher salary. I can't help but feel bad because my company is great and seems to really look out for their employees.

I started a monthly membership in June 2016 for $27/mo. I kept having this odd feeling that I had just payed my fee when I was having to pay each month. Well I finally checked my credit card statement and I have payed an additional $29/mo throughout my membership. When I log onto my account through my gym, it shows one charge per month, at $27.I brought this up over the phone with a manager there and they seemed pretty hesitant about refunding me the full ~$600 and said they would call me back later. Well, they didn't call back. Instead they cancelled my membership (which I never requested) and refunded me $60, so I'm still $540 short. I thought that it was possible they were charging me for my mom's membership since our gym accounts were once linked, but after checking her card history and her online gym account, we confirmed the charge was a mystery charge connected to nothing.What steps can I take to ensure I am refunded, or are they not legally required to due to how long it has been?"	$100 to get around $600 back is probably still worth it?	8d88pe	legaladvice	1	0
235	Found out ex's child is not mine biologically. Seeking info on removing my name from the birth certificate and preventing future costs. MD	"  My first divorce attorney has already quit over this so I know it's a complicated issue. I'm here to gather some information so that I can be prepared and efficient when meeting with the next one. To make a long story short, in the split it has come out that my soon to be ex wife's child is not mine biologically. I realize that the circumstances (her lying about going through with the insemination versus lying about an affair) are somewhat different from the average, but the fact of the matter is that this child is not mine. I know that legally I will be facing a massively uphill battle in recouping my past costs, so going forward I will only be seeking removal of my name from the birth certificate and a stop to any further costs (child support, college tuition, etc.)How do I prepare for this? What do I need to know? Any relevant cases I can read up on? Is there a point at which I could cite emotional damages?

I checked with my school's office of student living and the man I talked to confirmed that in his understanding, it is the financial responsibility of the landlord to provide pest services if the tenant is not at fault. The problem is, there is a section in my lease that says all pest control services will be charged to the tenant. This contradicts the earlier part of the lease that says that the landlord will follow all duties outlined in the VRLTA. I can't afford the charges, and furthermore I don't think I should have to pay them.

249	Reported to the HOA for barbell training in my garage	"Las Vegas, NV - USAI live in a 3 bedroom rental home in Vegas, my garage connects to my neighbor's garage, and we share a driveway with 2 other homes on the other side (4 homes total in 1 driveway).3x a week I enjoy barbell training in my garage (squats, bench, deadlifts) and my sessions last 45-60 minutes at the most. I always make sure to lift around 11am ending at 12pm, and the latest I've trained would be 3-4pm, never at night to disturb anyone.When I train I enjoy leaving the garage open for fresh air and natural lighting. I may play music on a small music box with the volume at a respectable level, never blasting.The neighbor's house on my side that connects with my garage is an old work friend from years ago that has no trouble with me lifting (and has young kids that nap). My neighbor directly across from me is very friendly as well and often says hello and chats with me.The neighbor diagonally across from me however always gives me dirty looks and recently reported me to the HOA saying I've converted my garage into a weight room, when I still use my garage for storing my car and other things, I just happen to also use a small part of it to train in.The violation letter I received basically says the garage has to be used for storing cars and can't be converted into a recreational or living space. I use my garage primarily for storing my car, my trash cans, and various other things, but I do have a small area for my squat rack and workouts which are only 3x a week less than an hour.After I got the email about this I started lifting with my garage door closed which made me really unhappy because I lose all the sunlight and fresh air, and I wasn't bothering anyone this guy is being petty. To add salt to the wound, this asshat neighbor started putting his trash can in front of my house on purpose. Not once did he do it prior to reporting me, always put it on his side of the shared driveway, now it's always smack dab in front of my house and he does it intentionally to frustrate me.Since the primary function of my garage is to store the car and other various things, am I legally allowed to workout in my garage 3x a week, or does the HOA and my douchebag neighbor have the power to tell me what I can or can't do in my own garage?"	how does he know what you're doing in there now?	a71g5p	legaladvice	1	1
250	How can I have people ship products to me safely?	"I am an Amazon seller and buy product from a store that have about 20 locations nationwide. I have been hiring people off Craigslist and paying them through Paypal Goods and Services to pay for the products, pick them up and ship them to me. Unfortunately a lot of the time Paypal holds the funds for 21 days since it considers it a ""high risk"" transaction when payments are over 1000$. The payment would go through instantly if I paid ""friends and family"" but there is no protection from Paypal. Is there any way I can legally write a contract where the person im hiring agrees that he is buying the products for me at a price?

"This all started a couple days ago, I'm in California btw, and my companies HR department had called me and started asking questions about why I'm not engaging at work, do I have a disability, am I on medications and what are they for. I told them that I am engaging, albeit I may not smile all the time but I'm not a stone faced person by any means. I did inform them that I was on medications for a person health issue, non of which are narcotic based, but that I was not comfortable with discussing my medical conditions. The then asked if I needed to be pit on leave because they don't want me to ""be at work but not at work"". I declined and that was the end of the conversation. That happened this past Monday. I show up to work today, saturday, and I was walked out of work and had my badge revoked. I was told I'm being suspended and to call back to work on Monday to follow up with HR. To me this seems like they literally just fired me.

I have been with the company for almost 3 months and never has anyone ever said anything to me. Do i have any legal recourse?

She is constantly moving, moving in with boyfriends and moving out. bringing her kids around all these new men (she has 3 girls ages 10-15) she has been with this one guy for about a year now. But is still talking to an ex, so they act like teenagers and slash each others tires, and do doughnuts on her lawn...There is SOOO much going on, we are 99% sure she is committing welfare fraud too. But now she is angry because my boyfriend got stern with their daughter. A very rare occurrence, his daughter is his entire world. He got stern because her mother left a text ""I'm keeping her this weekend"" so he asked what as sup, and no answer, he kept trying and no answer. He called and texted his daughter to no answer.. So her left a message on her phone (that apparently made her cry, according to her mother) ""it's your dad, I bought you this phone to get a hold of you not to play games, call me back."" so that unleashed a slew of text messages from the ex girlfriend. We have talked with a law firm here in Michigan called ADAM, its a law firm specially for men in child custody and divorce cases. My boyfriend has wanted to go after her for a very long time, his daughter is constantly telling us things that we feel puts her in an unsafe environment. we reported her to CPS for leaving her home all that time alone (she's 10) and CPS did nothing. We thought since the school was involved and wanting to know where his daughter has been that that would help. CPS didn't do anything, but it is on record. We need help. we plan on going to that law firm for men, but I would like to know what our steps are before going to the lawyers, like what to do, things to keep track of all that jazz."

Her name was not on the policy. I know this because my father hated her. My father had two children and I feel like we should have gotten the money. She did not tell me or my sibling about the life insurance. In fact after the funeral she told he didn't have any. She said that I would have to pay for the headstone for the grave because of this.

257	"(FL, US) Labor laws questions(2 of them)"	"Hello! Thanks for taking the time to read the following long post and for any advice that you can give. I have reviewed the page's wiki and determined that my question was not answered. I will apologize if I missed it.I am researching the labor laws of Florida based on my mother's situation. She currently works for a company as an hourly wage worker. She typically works more than 40 hours per week and is compensated for the overtime in accordance with the FLSA at 1.5x her hourly rate. However, it has come to my attention that she has worked more than 40 hours in a week, then took some hours of Paid Time Off(PTO) at the end of the week. Rather than take those PTO hours from her accrued bank of hours, they deducted it from her overtime hours worked in that week. My first question is the legality of this. My understanding is that her PTO is paid at straight time and, as previously mentioned, overtime is at 1.5x. The disparity here means she is losing money by trying to take vacation hours in a week that she works more than 40 hours. This has occurred on more than one occasion(she has worked with the company for 4 years).The next question is regarding hourly wage rates and full-time vs part-time positions. As I said, my mother has worked for this company for 4 years in full-time capacity. Recently, they have hired a new employee to do the same job, but part-time. The new employee's hiring rate was $12.00 per hour. My mother, after 4 years, is being paid at $10.50 per hour. The only additional information i have about the other employee is that they are a woman as well, so gender discrimination is not a concern. I am unsure if any other bias can be taken into consideration without speaking with my mom further. So, for this question i'd like to determine the legality of it based on a non-biased position. I would like to state that my mom has brought this up to her manager who stated that ""She gets paid more because she is part-time.""I apologize ahead of time if anything is unclear and i'd be more than happy to provide any amplifying information that is needed. Any details that I do not know I will request from my mother, so replies may be delayed as I get the information needed. Thanks again!"

258	Auto dealer contacts me every few months after I have told them not to call me again	"Here is a bit of the backstory. I bought a brand new car in 2011. The next day on my drive home from work I noticed a dent in the hood. It looked like a manufacturing defect and I brought it into the dealer within 48hours of purchasing it. The sales man said there was nothing they could do as did the sales manages and service manager. One of the managers actually asked if I had pissed someone off and they hit my hood with a mallet! The damage was minor and looked as if it was done before the vehicle was painted. I left the dealer frustrated and told them I wouldn't do any more business with them again. About 4 years ago I started receiving phone calls from them telling me they would like me to upgrade or they have someone interested in my car and I told them the above story, and that I would never do business with them again. I was always polite but firm and asked them not to call me anymore. But still, every 3-6 months I get a call from them with the same story. Today, I snapped at the poor woman on the phone. She said she is sorry for the service I received and will make sure I don't get called again. But the last 6 people I've talked to have said the same thing. I told her and the last few callers that I feel that I am being harassed by them but don't know if there is actually any legal recourse for me. I'm in Canada."

The story from the police is that a call was made from the bar saying he was rowdy, and somehow the next thing is my brother is leaving the bar and an officer is approaching him with lights and sirens. Officer says he followed him from the bar, and when my brother began speeding and driving erratically in response to being followed with lights and sirens he backed off. He says he rounded a corner and my brother had wrecked at high speed. This was fairly brief as the bar is pretty close to the crash site.¬†Witnesses heard sirens up until the crash, no backing off. Home security camera on block before wreck shows cop still chasing with lights. They took a significant time to get to him after the crash as they waited for a total of 9 cars to surround him. He was essentially dead when they got to him. He never responded and was brain dead on arrival.We're just trying to piece the story together because no one called us, not even the police.¬†ER workers eventually called us. 1. No charges were made that we're aware of. Is that weird?¬†2. I know entrapment isn't allowed, but are police allowed to follow someone from the bar if the bar called the police to say they were being rowdy?¬†3.

The insurance was purchased at 8:30 pm on August 30th. I got in an accident at around midnight  that same evening. Unbelievable, I know, but the information is all time stamped (credit card, emails, etc.). As I began exchange information at the accident I was concerned to realize that the effective date at the bottom of my card was September 1st. I thought the insurance was active upon purchase, though I may have simply made an error or misunderstood when I finalized the purchase. I wouldn't have been driving had I known my insurance wouldn't be active for another 24-30 hrs.The accident was largely mutual cause, it was pouring rain, and we didn't see each other. Cop that showed up hardly did anything so that wasn't helpful. Anyway, what I'm wondering is if there's any chance USAA will be understanding or if they'll stiff arm me, and I'll lose $10,000 on my car, or worse, be sued or have my license suspended or something.

274	(USA) (MA/ME) My wife's uncle is trying to illegally block us from using a family house this summer. Will my MIL's demand letter help?	"Hey legaladvice, I wrote [this formal demand](https://imgur.com/gallery/FBeFIxj) for my mother-in-law. Basically, what has been going on is her and her brother both live in MA and are are the two appointed co-trustees for their late father's family trust that he set up. The trust consists of a lake house in Maine and an account that started at ~$115K in 2002 and now has ~$90K. The way the trust is written, both co-trustees need to agree to any expenses or changes, but her brother has been acting without regard to her or their late father's wishes. First, he lost about $15K in bad investments that she never consented to back in 2005-2007. Last year he sent out letters asking for advice to supplement the trust fund, then 2 weeks later sent out letters saying he'd come to the conclusion that everybody would need to pay $500 per week to stay there (except him or his daughter because of ""all they do"" of course lmao). Well MIL promptly called him and said that no, nobody in the family will be charged a fee to use the family vacation house, the funds in the account are sufficient for the time being, and they'll discuss a plan of action if and when it becomes necessary. He grumbled and said OK. Now my wife and I scheduled 3 separate weeks there this summer months ago, the first of which begins this Sat 6/1/19. On this last Friday we got a knock on the door with a certified letter from him. It said he had changed the locks and nobody was allowed there unless we paid $1500 for last summer and $1500 up front for this summer. We think he did this very intentionally as Monday was a holiday and we'd have no way to figure anything out in 4 short days. I drafted this [this ""formal demand""](https://imgur.com/gallery/FBeFIxj) for my MIL and we intend to mail it out with new keys to everyone authorized to use the house, go there anyway, and change the locks back to a shared key. My question is, will bringing this document in addition to copies of the will, the trust agreement, and a signed and notarized letter from MIL that we are allowed to be there protect us in the **VERY LIKELY** event he shows up or sends his daughter and tries to have us removed/arrested for trespassing?"

275	Potential illegal kickback	"Edit: This is in PennsylvaniaTo make a long story short, I've recently been hired as a business manager for a Pharmacy.  Since accepting the position, I've learned of the owner discounting a copay on a regular basis for at least one patient since 2016.There are records of a discounted sale on the copay, and also of a gift certificate being created for the customer without being paid for as they stand at the register, and given to the customer to use towards the prescription.The reason for the discounting, as is written in the patients notes, is that the pharmacy gets reimbursed more for the generic of the prescription than the brand. However, the generic is more expensive for the patient than the brand, so the copay is being worked in a way to make it so the patient isn't paying anymore than they normally would. I did some digging online and, by my understandi g, found that adjustment or waiving of a copay on a regular basis is considered an illegal kickback by the OIG.I'm not sure if this has been done with any other patients, as I'm still new to the company, but I was curious as to whether or not this should be something I consider becoming a whistleblower for.Any help is appreciated!"

You will also receive a salary of $\[XYZ\].""Now, I was quite pleased with $\[XYZ\] as it was quite generous and some of the friends I showed the contract to agreed. As such, I didn't bother to negotiate. Two days ago, I received my first pay check and it was apparent that there was a misunderstanding. I got paid about 1/5th of what I expected, and when I did the math, it was clear that they extrapolated my pay to an annual salary--that is, I would receive 10/52 \* $\[XYZ\] for my 10-week internship. And while this new amount is above minimum wage, it's not at all competitive given the field and location, so am considering bringing up the misunderstanding and trying to renegotiate.  Do I have any sort of legal leverage to renegotiate my salary given the ambiguity of wording and misunderstanding? Is there any world where I am entitled to the full amount, $\[XYZ\]?"

288	Slumlord files eviction	"I live in georgia, us.  I moved in on the last day of school (early june), I have paid my rent regularly, but this landlord has been a joke as far as repairs.  I have outlets that don't work, weak floors in a couple of places, and recently discovered that there is a major rodent problem that has LITERALLY led to rats FALLING OUT OF MY WALL from holes left open around the fuse box.  There are exposed wires and holes in the wall.  On top of everything else, I found out that before I moved in HE KNEW about the rats (that are coming from a burnt out property directly next door that he owns).  This is a trailer park, I expected the roaches that were there when I moved in, but I draw the line at rats, when I moved in I had ZERO infestations in my stuff, so nothing came from me, but I was on a deadline and it was a case of desperation to find a place.  I had my health insurance draw from my account, went ahead, paid my other bills and planned to pay on my next check, which they were informed of.  Two days later (unbeknownst to me) I was served an eviction.  It wasn't on my door, and not handed to any adult in my house.  My thought is that the constable possibly handed it to my son, who is 15, and autistic.

289	[TX] Dry Cleaners destroyed two expensive sweaters and refuse to reimburse me for the full value of them. I want to sue in small claims court.	"Among several other items, I dropped off two wool sweaters to my dry cleaner last week and picked them up Friday. I just noticed yesterday that they obviously washed the wool sweaters, rather than dry cleaning them. For those that don't know, washing wool makes it shrink *significantly* -- to the point that I can't even fit them both anymore. They're useless to me, which is quite unfortunate because I spent ~$100 each for them. I don't make very much money, so this is not at all a trivial amount to me. I know $200 may seem like pocket change to some, but it's a significant amount to me. There is no question that they were supposed to be dry cleaned and not washed, and this was not a case of miscommunication. The reason I know this for a fact is because this cleaners has a special on shirts, where if you drop off at least $10 worth of dry cleaning, they knock 50 cents off each shirt. I almost always do this promo and it's worked perfectly for me for over a year now. It is very specifically dry cleaning, because even if I dropped off 30 shirts, that wouldn't qualify for the promo, as shirts are laundered and not dry cleaned. There is a very big distinction between the two, and they clearly are at fault without question.  I called the cleaners this morning and they are refusing to reimburse me for the value of the sweaters (which were in flawless condition). I want to take them to small claims court and sue for the value of the sweaters and all court/legal costs. Do I have a viable case? I do not have proof of purchase of these sweaters, as I purchased them several months ago and have since discarded the receipt. Is this an issue? Are there other obstacles that will prevent me from having a good case against them? I don't view this as a frivolous case and I certainly am not trying to blow this out of proportion. I just want to be able to buy the sweaters again, and it shouldn't be at my expense because of their negligence. What's my best course of action?"

290	Just Given Notice to Vacate	"Hi, I've been renting a house in Western NY for the past two years and at the end of the summer the landlord put the house up for sale.  In September they transitioned me to month-to-month lease.  This past week I was notified that the house was sold and new owner moving in upstairs.  Yesterday, 10/30/18, I was given a ""30 day notice to quit/vacate"".  It states,""Please take notice, that pursuant to your lease dated prior to current ownership your tenancy located at 3.....NY will not be renewed and is hereby terminated effective immediately, said date being at least thirty days from the date of service upon you.""  I've been given until November 30th to vacate.  Now, the landlord is requesting last months rent.  As I see it, my lease with the previous owner was terminated from this notice before the end of the month, and seeing as I have not signed any new lease with the new owner for the month of November, I am under no obligation to pay him.  Am I right in thinking this? Any other rights I should be aware of? Thanks!"	Why would you not owe the last month's rent?	9t5b0w	legaladvice	1	0

Since then I have only had a speeding ticket and a minor fender bender. Last night I was driving and took a turn too fast and spun out, crashing my car. I was scared as hell and call a tow truck to come get it and also called and Uber. Cops came up as I was walking away to a position a 20ft away from my car. Told me to stop on the microphone and proceeded to talk with me. I refused the breathalyzer and opted for the blood test. Uber came as I was being arrested and they could have mentioned it in the report. No clue on the tow truck. I was booked and released later on $2500 bail for misdemeanor DUI. With the Uber and tow truck thing, do you think I should hire an attorney. I work 20ish miles away and my school is like 10-15 miles away. It'd be awesome to obtain a restricted license so I can still work and go to school, but I understand that the second duo carries much stricter suspension time frames.

The kid or/and the ball could have damaged them.What should I do after this? I noticed NYS code says basketball hoops have to be on their driveway. If used on street, it needs to be stored when unused. Should I contact the town to enforce this and if my plants are damaged, should I pursue the owner of the house or the kid? I have a clear image.

He comes home at 4am with friends and wants to put on music and drink and stuff. He said when he moved on he had a stable job and he had pay stubs to prove it, but since he's moved in he's skipped work more times than he's gone. He moved in with next to nothing. He had clothes and a futon mattress. Because of this, he's had to use all my things in the kitchen and I said it's alright if he uses them, but they need to be cleaned when he's done with it and he'll just leave my cookware in the sink for days at a time. He and his friends trash the yard daily, he invites people with kids over and they leave the kids to watch tv while they go get high out back. He's done cocaine more days than he hasn't since he's moved in. And recently I found out he's associated to some pretty violent and gang related individuals and he's got a gun he never mentioned to me. Sufficed to say I get this guy out of my life.

I was considering to go with Ryzen 3000 (which I did), so I specifically chose the 3200 Mhz C16 option of the Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB 16 GB Kit, since that's what was recommended for Ryzen 2000. Obviously, I should have waited, since my motherboard at the time couldn't even support that speed (MSI B150M Bazooka), and when Ryzen 3000 released, the recommended speed was now 3600 Mhz. So, currently my PC has a Ryzen 7 3800X with the memory I listed above (Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB C16 at 3200 Mhz). So, here's my question.Along with gaming, I use my PC for video editing (and music production, but I don't think that's as memory intensive), and  I eventually want to upgrade to 32 GB of memory. So, should I buy another 16 GB of my current memory, or should I buy a kit of 3600 Mhz memory and then buy another 16 GB kit of it later on? I don't need to have 32 GB immediately. I honestly don't even know when I'm going to actually buy it, I just want to know which one I should choose when the times comes. The kit I'm looking at is the Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 16 GB C18 at 3600 Mhz.Thanks for any help!"	What motherboard do you have now?	doqxyj	pcmasterrace	1	1

385	The sadness when you no longer meet minimum specs	"Interesting situation for me....I built a PC a long time ago, and it's been great for years. I put a new GPU in a couple of years ago, and I've been running everything I wanted to at resolutions &amp; FPS I've been happy with.I have been considering/looking at an upgrade for a while, but it's one of those ""needs new mb, cpu and ram"" upgrades rather than just a single component.  I haven't been in a position to afford an upgrade, but it hasn't been a problem.Today I was looking at the BFV stuff and saw the minumum specs, and realised for the first time I couldn't make it (cpu-wise), and it was a weird feeling.All the advances in GPU tech over the last 5-10 years have been great and allowed me to keep up (4K aside) and play wonderful games with great visuals.  Upgraded to SSDs a few years ago and that again gave a sweet bump. It's like the human body....you can get a hip replacement, lung transplant, heart transplant, prosthetic limbs, a butt lift, but eventually the brain will simply get too old and you will die.It's easy of course for us to focus on the cutting edge of this lifestyle, with amazing builds and people pushing products beyond what they were originally thought capable of. However for a great majority of us it's about enjoying what we can with what we have - and we've been in a glorious era where SSDs and GPU compatibility has meant we can incrementally upgrade and continue to enjoy amazing games and online experiences with our friends without the stereotype of ""having to buy a whole new system every year"".For me, that time is at an end. I don't know if/when I'll be able to afford an upgrade, and of course it's only a single game impacted at this stage - I still have plenty to enjoy. I just thought it was a timely reminder of how for many of us we've been able to squeeze so much value out of our beloved rigs :)edit: maybe time to add a ""descending peasant"" flair or something :p"	"minimum specs dont really mean anything, what is the cpu?"	9743ih	1	1	1

387	The 120 FPS Joke isn't Something we Should Laugh at	"Yes, I know, masterrace and all. Hear me out though. Everyone likes to joke about consoles on this sub, and it's understandable. Consoles hitting 120 FPS is something we should be encouraging, not mocking. Here's why. TV manufacturers go with the demand of what the consumer finds popular at the time. Sometimes this is a hit, sometimes it's a miss. Consoles are something that can easily influence the market because of how common they become in a household. These things sell millions upon millions of units. HDR has been pushed recently and a big reason for it is console marketing. Now can you imagine TV manufacturers focusing on things like display port and Freesync? With consoles marketing these features they will become more common, and cheaper. That's my take on it. Disagree if you'd like, that's fine. I just want everyone's gaming experience to be kick ass... and cheaper. My wallet hates me as it is."

"So recently there was the Windows 10 update and ever since then my girlfriend has been having really weird issues with her computer. It's always the same problem. After some use  programs on the PC will stop responding or loading anything, the mouse turns into a loading wheel, and nothing becomes clickable and then the computer freezes up completely. She has to force shut down the computer.This is her description of the issue:*At random, two specific apps (steam and discord for sure, but also seemingly windows update as I last had issues with that giving me an error code like 800x800005? i think. when I checked it for funsies) will stop loading any new info as if they can't or aren't connected to the internet. though if i'm in a discord call it will stay up. from there, my PC degrades, either not allowing me to ctrl+alt+del or do anything other than open my start menu. it'll slowly get worse this way until it freezes. screen still shows, just the circular loading ring will keep going, and nothing will happen (HDD access light on case goes off, no sounds of use/stress on components.)*It also started doing this to her on startup too and it seems to reproduceable. She's tried reseating her RAM, her GPU, and has even done a fresh install of Windows by reformatting through installation media. The issue still persists. Any guidance will be much appreciated!"

400	Roth IRA vs stocks returns	To start off I'm a 22 year old male in college. In around March of 2017 I put $7200 in around 30 different stocks I believed were stable companies such as CAT AMAZON GOOGLE EXON NVDIA etc and as of right now have 8.980 so a return of about 1700. What are some recommendations should I leave the money in stocks and put all my salary in Roth IRA or sell stocks and put that in a Roth IRA or what. I know it's a retirement savings account but if I will get more returns from stocks shouldn't I just keep adding to stocks?

Thank you for reading through this post and providing advice. If you need any additional information, please don't hesitate to ask and I will be happy to provide it.I have a total credit card debt of $5,255.89 between two credit cards. Details are below.Chase Freedom Unlimited w/ 0% interest until March 2019: $4,404.64; minimum payment $55/month, however I contribute around $120/month to this account.Citi ThankYou Preferred w/ 0% interest until October 2018: $851.25; minimum payment is $25/month, however I contribute around $230/month to this account. I put a few bills (total of \~ $170/month) on this credit card, FYI. I have an Ally savings account with a balance of $6,934.08. I am unable to contribute to the savings account at all and it's been at a stand still (aside from the building interest). Every month after ALL of my bills including food + entertainment (which really isn't a lot as I had to cut down to pay down the debt), I have nearly $350 left over. I have been aggressively trying to pay this debt down, but I see no end and if my calculations serve me correct, I won't be able to pay them down in time that the 0% interest deal cuts off. I am wondering if I should put any of my savings towards paying down this debt, and maybe that way I can start to build up my savings again without worrying about the debt over my head? Do you have any advice on how I can do this? Please let me know if you have any questions, and please go easy on me.... I am still learning about finances. I know it's a sticky situation.

403	To sublease or not?	"I just signed a lease with a couple of friends in Chicago. But I'm going to relocate to Salt Lake City for a job with a nice pay bump, so I need to decide how to get out of my lease.I need your advice in figuring out whether or not to sublet my apartment. Subletting is allowed in the Chicago tenant ordinance, but managing a lease from Utah would be a bit of a pain if the sub-tenant refused to pay rent, caused issues with the roommates, or damaged the apartment. In addition to the headache, all these issues could incur financial costs as well.So my roommates have offered to have me instead pay them 50% of the cost of the rent for the whole year (about 5K) and they will agree to assume liability for the lease. We will of course get this in writing. I get a nice signing bonus with the new job, so I can definitely afford the 5K.So what are your thoughts here? 5K is a lot to pay, but it would certainly offer a lot of peace of mind, and the closure of moving on from the agreement."

I don't want to stay here because well, memories. The market in Salt Lake City is pretty hot so purchase prices are relatively high. Renting is also pretty high and I'm tired of that game. So emotionally, buying sounds nice. I'm currently under contract for a house but I'm starting to panic a bit:-	297k purchase price-	15k down (borrowed, interest free from family)-	3.5% 30 year fixed.-	Seller is paying closing costs up to 5k-	payment works out to be $1543Debts are low-ish:-	$271 car payment-	$56 for iPhone upgrade programAssets are low too:-	$4400 in a traditional IRA that my last employer rolled over from a 401k.

409	Mortgage Mystery	"My husband and I are currently living in my mother-in-law's second house to save up for our own home and become debt-free. We just pay utilities and look after the house while she stays at her other property in another state. She says that she wants to keep this house in the family and sell to us when we're ready... Which would be great, but our combined income at ages 28 and 29 is $125k and this house is now worth about $660k so we'd probably be house-poor for the rest of our lives. There's no way around that without seriously increasing our income, right? Anyway, my real question comes from seeing my mother-in-law's mortgage statement. The house was purchased in 1994 for $169k. The principal remaining on the most recent statement is $144k at 4% and the term is set until 2048. Does this mean she refinanced this year? Does this also mean she is facing significant financial hardship? I don't understand how one can own a house for that long and only effectively have paid $20k on it... I am very scared about purchasing a home and clearly don't know much about mortgages. Can anyone help me understand the situation? If she is facing hardship, we would be willing to pay the mortgage amount ($1300; instead of the $450 we currently pay for utilities) if it meant we could live here longer (super sweet house and a fantastic area and school for our daughter).

So in 2000 they had their friend get a home loan in her name .(once again I know how dumb this is) fast forward to 2010 and my sister took the house and let it get absolutely destroyed by failing to redo the roof. The house needs over $60000 in work, and has a 140000 mortgage against it. Our plan was to surrender the property back to the bank , but it would leave my parents friends retirement fund open for the bank to take.

411	"Laid off, locked into new home build. Looking for advice"	"The wife and I had decided that it was time to move closer to friends and family, so we chose to build a new house instead of buying a pre-existing home.Everything was going fine, we had put our 10% down on the new place, had our current house on the market, the new house had already broken ground, and was under way.  At the beginning of the month, I was laid off.  Since this threw a major wrench into the works, we decided to call off the selling of our house, and try to work with the builder to get out of the new place.  The builder repeatedly told us that they would work with us to get our deposit back in case something happened.  Needless to say, the builder is being less than forthcoming to offer our deposit back.  Since we've already passed the period where we chose material and colors for the house, this, in a way, locks us in.I've offered to take a hit to our 10% down if he'd be willing to just give us the difference for his time and effort.  I'm more than willing to work with them at this point.I've reached out to a local real estate attorney who says that there might be some grounds for an unjust enrichment case, or the builder being in breach of contract for not doing their due diligence in getting the house done in a timely manner.  We are set on staying in our current house, and no longer want to move.  The kids have had too much instability to try and force another move on them.  I guess what I'm asking is if anyone has dealt with this before, or could point me in the right direction, or can give me some advice in how to move forward.  Worst case scenario I could try to get it settled in court, but I would prefer to settle in amicably.Thank you in advance."	Where is the house?	dhxwta	personalfinance	1	1

I make $15 an hour to do the job of a general manager in what is a small-medium business 100+ employees and contractors.2. The business experienced a slow period beginning early 2016 and ending mid-late 2017. 3. Sadly, our company's owner passed away last year, family has taken over and have begun to chase business down, business is now booming for us. We honestly can't find enough skilled employees to fill our void.... we are actually turning business/contacts down. 4. I want to ask for a raise, but I am afraid to negotiate at this point. I also believe that the job I am doing should pay a minimum of $25 an hour or atleast a 50k salary. 5. I'm currently motivated to either look for a job that pays better or ask for a raise due to being miserable because of another employee that we can't afford to let go at this point. I am constantly biting my tongue and letting a lot of issues go. The leadership in the company is well aware of the situation and have asked me to be patient and deal with it for the time being.6. If I were to leave the company at this point, it would be extremely hard for them to find someone who could learn a program that I implemented in our company to track finances, inventory, working hours of employees, maintenance on equipment, etc.. I've also manipulated the program to create custom reports at the owners request.  No one else in our company is trained to use the program. Do you guys/gals think it would be too soon to negotiate a livable income? I am more motivated than ever at this point because of my unhappiness lately (due to a fellow employee). Should I even mention the fact that I've been knowingly putting up with the other employees harrassment/childish games for the past 3 years so that we could attempt to find a replacement or should I just bring up all of the responsibilities I currently have?

424	Tax return offset due to student loan debt.	"Sorry in advance, posting this from my phone.  Some backstory, I am currently in default to my student loans.  The loans are being handled by Pioneer Credit Recovery, and I entered into their rehabilitation program on Oct 12th.  So I filed my taxes back on Jan 27th, so you may see my dilemma.  I needed to make 5 on time qualifying payments in order to stop my tax return from being offset, and I made 4 with my 5th scheduled for direct withdrawal on Feb 12th.I'm currently waiting on hold with Dep of Ed to see if there's anything I can do but was wondering if any of you know of options I may have?

He mentioned yesterday to me that the pool had pretty much drained his finances, it just turned out more expensive than expected.  He mentioned the other day he was planning on trading in his vehicle, while it still had a good value, and use the equity to get into a lease which he claims he'd pay off.  Somehow it makes sense in his mind and i guess the thought process is the lease would buy enough time for them to rebuild their finances.I've never quite understood him when it comes to vehicles, i always hear ""10 years and it has to go"" or other times about ""i should trade this is while it still has value and i can get a newer one"" Maybe I'm the one who needs straightened out, but i think the smart play would be to attempt to budget better and keep the vehicles as they stand.  Or if he does trade in the vehicle, go buy a used one outright which i don't think he'd ever do.&amp;#x200B;So A, I'm asking if leasing a vehicle has any merit whatsoever?B.

430	Credit card company closed my account and made me forfeit my accrued cash rewards without any warning	"My Bank of America credit card account (of 10 years) recently got closed with the reason stating my ""risk profile no longer aligns with the bank's risk tolerance"".I have had this credit card for a while, so I had accrued quite a bit of cash rewards. I never felt the need to cash out my cash rewards and by the time my account closed down, I had ~$182.Upon receiving notice of BOA closing my CC, I attempted to cash out but the website kept giving me errors. The written letter I received stated that ""all cash rewards will be forfeited"". No grace period. No warning. Absolutely nothing.I was aware CC and Debit cards work differently, but it never occurred to me that CC companies can just shut down your account and your cash rewards can disappear on their terms. So, I wanted others to know that if they have a (substantial) amount of cash rewards, be cautious that they can just take it away.TLDR; Bank closed my CC account and made me forfeit all my accrued cash back rewards with no warning.(other details.

While I have paid the card off on time each billing cycle, I had a bill from a hospital visit back in 2017 go into collections which has impacted my credit score. BoA shows my FICO score as 617 while CreditKarma has it at 741. Pretty big discrepancy IMO. After a few google and reddit searches, it appears as if I am not alone as other people have reported similar issues. However, their scores were usually off by 10-50 points, not as big of a deficit as mine.I understand CreditKarma uses the Vantage 3.0 which is a different scoring method than FICO but I am still curious as to the large gap in the scores. Which score will lenders most likely use when I apply for a mortgage and other cards? Is there a score I should rely more on to gauge my financial health or is this one of those instances where both scores are taken into account and should be viewed equally?22M, working full time."

434	How should I use my $1700 auto insurance claim payout?	"Here's what happened: there was a storm and a tree limb struck our parked car. I reported this to my auto insurer, they sent an agent to check out the damage, and shortly after deposited about $1700 in our bank account. This amount is their estimate of repair costs minus a $500 deductible for non-collision damage.My wife and I were actually not expecting any payout unless we went and got it repaired, which we did not intend to do since the damage is purely aesthetic (several large dents on the rear quarter panel). But since they've deposited money in our account already, we're now wondering what we should do. The obvious option is to spend it on repairing the damage, which we haven't ruled out and I'm working on finding a place to go get an estimate from, but which we're not sure we *want* to do. The main reason being, it may end up costing us ~$500 (if the insurance estimate is accurate), and the car works just fine, it just looks ugly with the damage. So my question is basically would it actually be *more* responsible to spend this money paying off some of our debts? Would love to hear from folks who have been in a similar position, thank you!Here are some potential alternative uses I'm considering:* We have about $6k in credit card debt between the two of us and this would be enough to pay the remaining balance on the highest interest card. * Pay off the remaining balance on the auto insurance itself. I pay $115/month for auto insurance and if I pay off my remaining balance ($1266), I'll have that money back each month to put toward debt.* Place in savings account to accrue interest until we are (credit card) debt free and making the repair would be an easier choice to make.Additional details: We use basically every dollar we make monthly after necessary expenses to pay off debt and put in savings, so this is not a trivial amount of money for us (it's about the cost of our monthly rent + utilities)."

My credit card from there has a balance of $447.64 that I owe, and an interest rate of 15.5%Current Monthly payments of $25.00Card two is from another credit union that I had to open an account with to get my car loan. $403.26 is what I owe them with an interest rate of 16.5%. Current monthly payments of $25.00Card three... is a Best Buy credit card I opened to purchase a new computer I needed for work. It was a $1,000 purchase back in September of 2017. I have it down to $864.99. There's zero interest owed on this card so long as I pay it off in the 12 month promotional period. Otherwise, I will be back charged all the owed interest...I've only been making monthly payments of $27.00 on this. I was originally planning on using my tax returns to pay most of this off, but alas, I ended up owing a couple bucks this tax season. Yes, I know I'm dumb. I was being naive and reckless.

440	Feeling a little lost on how to finance a renovation of a unexpectedly inherited home.	"My wife unexpectedly came into possession of her grandfather's old house. It is bought and paid for (i.e. there is no money owed on the home). Since we were struggling with affording the rising cost of living where we were living at the time, we decided to make the jump and move into this house to try and save some money / finally be homeowners. Even though we knew this was a risky move, we still didn't plan well enough for this big life event financially. We have no savings and are living off of just one income until I can also find work. While this works for the time being, it doesn't easily afford us the chance to do some very necessary and big repairs to the home. And in a way we're kind of caught in a cyclical trap of sorts. Let me explain:* The area we live in is prone to hurricanes, so we need to get the house insured asap.* We can't get homeowner's insurance until the house passes a 4 point inspection* To pass this, we need a new roof and a functional heater* We can't afford to pay for these things without financial assistance* We looked into getting a home equity loan or line of credit, but we need insurance first. Also we don't make much money at the moment and are unsure how well our credit scores are doing ( I think that mine is okay since I've been paying off a student loan and credit card on time, but I haven't checked it lately).TL:DR we got a house for free but it needs work. To work on it we need a loan. To get a loan we need insurance. To get insurance we need to fix the house.I know we're not in a totally unsolvable situation, but I was wondering if anybody out there had any helpful advice to offer to a dude who has unwittingly gone from 0-60 mph in the world of fiscal responsibility.

441	Home buying dilemma	"Hi everyone,I posted a while back about selling our home and buying a new one and I'm here for more advice.We got a buyer and are under contract. We expect to net maybe 22k from our sale.Homes where we are moving are 135k, so max we can put down is 15% and we'll have to pay PMI.Our credit scores are lower than we thought. SO's is 685, mine is 699. Our loan officer is offering interest rates of 4.0% for an FHA loan and 4.75% for a conventional loan. SO is trying to shop around for better rates.FHA has a PMI of $84/month for 11 years if we put 10% down.Conventional loan has a PMI of $71/month.(This was with 10% down for a loan of 142k so it might reduce slightly with 15% down on a smaller loan)Questions:Should we wait till we have saved up 20% to avoid PMI, and maybe have better credit scores? The downside of this is interest rates might rise too and eliminate any savings. We'd also have to pay rent and possibly pay to break a lease in January/February. Not to mention moving costs and a baby on the way in December.FHA vs conventional loan? We want to make additional payments and have the PMI drop, which wouldn't happen with an FHA loan. We would be stuck paying PMI for 11 years but with an ultimately lower monthly payment. ($40 less because of lower rates) It's also a seller's market with homes flying off the market and sellers may be reluctant to accept an offer with FHA rules tied to it. Any and all advice is welcome. We're 26, and the homes where we're moving can only appreciate since it's a college town.Thank you!"

My grandparents have been in a precarious financial situation for several years with declining health and a house that needs lots of repairs. They are in their 80's.Somehow they got this company to lend them $12k and are paying about $450 per month to them. They have Social Security and a pension check that total around $2k per month.My grandma pays all her bills in person, including this bill. In April she went into the branch and was told that she could skip April's payment. She took them at their word and did not make that payment. She was called a few days later and they demanded payment. Since April she has been 1 payment behind. They call her dozens of times per day.She simply cannot afford to pay back this loan. They can barely afford to eat.If she doesn't make the payment, what can they do to them? I assume they will sue and they will win, but can they garnish their Social Security and pension? If One Main has a lien put on their house, can they force my grandparents to sell the house?I don't know why they felt the need to get this loan, it is for something they did not share with us, but I assume it was for repairs to the home. They went through another financial setback several years ago and their credit was trashed from it.Any advice would be appreciated. They live in Wisconsin."

456	Using personal savings for corporate expense account	"Hi all, &amp;#x200B;My husband recently took a position with a medical marijuana company and the job requires him to travel.  Currently, we are using out personal savings for expenses (uber, hotel stays, flights, etc.) and they are reimbursing us.  As you may be aware, medical marijuana companies can have difficulty using the banking system due to federal regulations and the discussion within his company is how to get corporate credit cards for it's employees.  I have a problem with his company using us as a bank.  We've had this discussion and I know that his company is working on a fix.  I'm trying to navigate this without upsetting my husband and creating a difficult time for him at his job.  Any thoughts on the best way to manage this situation?  Thanks."

459	[US/Canada] I'm planning on getting student loans and becoming an international student in Canada. What should I aim for as far as loans?	"I'm an American citizen. I plan on going to community college in the US and get my grades where they need to be and then heading up to Canada to finish up the last 2 years of my degree.I'm expecting roughly $110-120k CAD in debt from this.My degree would be in Computer Science with a focus in information security. I am not worried about finding a job post graduation as the tech hubs there (Vancouver and Toronto) are always hiring for Technical roles. I know it would be difficult as, I would need to find a job pretty much immediately after leaving school making at least 80-90k CAD a year at minimum and preferably 100-120k CAD.The attraction to this route is it helps with immigration by securing extra points by graduating from a Canadian University AND allowing me to work in the country for up to 3 years, when it comes to their Comprehensive Scoring System for Express Entry applicants.Is there any preferably way of going about doing this?"

460	Changing employment status in company - How do I optimize this change?	"Last year, I was hired through an agency as a freelancer on a 1-year contract through a staffing agency and was paid hourly. The company now wants to onboard me as a freelancer but under their ""roster"" directly and put me on salary.With the agency out of the equation, my company will obviously be shelling out less money on my compensation. Knowing that my company has a bigger budget to spend on me, how do I come about to negotiate a bump in my salary?Thank you in advance, PF."

461	My mom opened an investment account in my name and I have not known about it. I need tax help.	"Hey guys, I was hoping y'all could help me figure out the tax implications of my situation.  I'm 30 and live in Alabama (US).My mom just told me about a Goldman Sachs investment account she opened for me as a minor many years ago as part of the ""Uniform Transfers to Minors Act"".  I did not know about the account until recently so I have not transferred it over to my name and have never claimed taxes.  She wants me to liquidate the account and give her the money.  She does not handle finances well and I don't need the money so that is not an issue.  But I am worried about how this will affect my taxes.  One more wrinkle to the story... the SSN they have listed for me is wrong.  They transposed a digit so the IRS currently has no idea this account is related to me.  1.  My wrong SSN is the one listed on the account.2.  The account balance is about $4,500 now3.  The account is in the name of:[Mom's name] CUST[My name]UNIF TRANS MIN ACT - ALWhat are my tax implications if I correct the SSN and liquidate the account and give the money to my mom?"	has the account generated per year?	8g9svp	personalfinance	1	1
462	Conservative half of savings for a house: HYSA or Bonds?	"I've been unsure how to allocate the conservative portion of my saving for a house.I'd figured a 50/50 split between equities and a conservative position would be a good way to invest money that I definitely want to have around in 5-10 years.On one hand, I have a High-Yield Savings Account that gets 3.3%, which outpaces inflation and guarantees no fluctuation in the market.One the other hand, I know the conventional recommendation is to invest in a bond fund. However the last several years in a total market bond fund would have lost you 2%-3%. But I know that reinvestment of dividends counts for something too.Is one a better option than another?"

464	Should I take out a loan?	"I work a lot of hours on part time salary, while going to college. I was originally wanting to move out, but want to save money while at home. I only want one thing in life right now as a personal want rather than a need... a really good computer for games and editing softwares and everything. I have all of my parts picked out as well as monitors, and its around 4k i want to take out of the bank as a loan... would it be a decent idea to take a loan from the bank to help pay for this project? I just don't have enough and it would take a while to acquire the funds, even at home. This was the one thing I've wanted for a long time... and since I'm not moving out I would have/make enough to pay it off over time. Would this be a good idea?"

465	Negotiating a salary for a new position at a company where I am currently an hourly wage employee.	"Hi PF,Some background :I have recently interviewed for a position that is at my current company (roughly 500 employees) but in another department. My current supervisor called me today to give me a heads up ""off the record"" that it is likely they are going to make me an offer. I would have entirely different job responsibilities, but to put the position into perspective there are about 20 employees with my current title and 1 person with the new title. I currently make $16.50/hr with 1.5x overtime past 40 hours, however I work a few months out of the year where I am paid at a slightly higher rate via monthly bonus. I also am paid quite a bit in expenses as I use my personal vehicle, and am reimbursed at the IRS rate. In 2018 I grossed about $54k, with about $9k of that coming from expenses.  The one other person in my new position is salaried at about $50k. My personal vehicle will not be used as often, but still on occasion. I am looking for advice for opening salary negotiation when the time comes. I would really like to be making $60+ but I don't know if that is feasible. Any advice on this is appreciated, particularly if anyone has been in this type of position before. Thanks!!"	How different is the job from what you're currently doing?	apxf49	personalfinance	1	1
466	"Should I break it off from my parents financially, or am I being stupid?"	"Background: I am 22 years old and in college. My parents cover almost all of my expenses. Tuition, car and health insurance, cell phone bill, rent, and some food expenses. I pay for my gas and any personal items, including some food expenses. I have $22k in a bank account as an inheritance from my deceased grandfather. I work a part-time job at my college that can only go up to 20 hrs a week per University policy. I have 5-6 quarters left at my school before I can graduate. I am graduating with a liberal arts degree but plan to complete the prerequisites for vet school at a community college and work full-time before applying.My mother handles most of the finances and is constantly complaining to me about the expenses of sending me to school, paying for everything for me, and more recently is now complaining about paying health bills for me, saying I go to the doctor unnecessarily. The health bill thing is a bit confusing as the only real bill she's had for my medical stuff was an urgent care visit, but otherwise my visits have been copay only which I cover. This complaining has been going on for years and it is seriously draining and is starting to have a negative impact on my mental health. When I offer to take on my expenses through financial aid and student loans, she refuses, and says she and my father ""agreed to pay for 4 years of college, so that's what they're going to do."" I never expected this of them, but every time I mention it, she says the same thing.I am aware that I'm incredibly lucky to have my parents pay for so much, and that many people would love to be in my position. But the constant nagging and complaining is damaging both my own mental health, and my relationship with them. Should I just suck it up and reap the benefits of them paying for another year? Or should I break off from them financially and pay for the rest of my schooling, likely making living difficult for the next few years."
