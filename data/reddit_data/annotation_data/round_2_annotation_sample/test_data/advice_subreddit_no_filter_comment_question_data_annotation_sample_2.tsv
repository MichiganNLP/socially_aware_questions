"My school nurse lied about my parents agreeing with her regarding my medication for a trip, what can I do"	"I'm a senior in an NC high school and I'm going on a three-day school trip to NYC in a week. I have ADHD and I take Adderall to focus in my classes, but I ONLY take it at school because its side effects mess with me a lot (loss of appetite, dehydration, sweating, and overall lack of enjoyment). My parents understand this and it was pretty much already decided that I wouldn't take it on my NYC trip because I won't need it anyways.When my school's nurse looked through my forms and noticed that there wasn't a form for Adderall, she decided she should call my parents and explain why she thought I should take my Adderall on the trip, implying that if I didn't, I'd ""cause trouble"" and my parents would have to drive from NC to NY to pick me up. My ADHD has never gotten me into trouble.My parents couldn't believe she would actually call us to say that, and stayed firm on the decision not to have me take the Adderall. That was around two weeks ago, and I just found out yesterday that she told the other people in charge of the meds and the trip that she'd talked with my parents and they'd agreed I should take the Adderall on the trip. But when I went home and asked my parents, they said they never agreed with her. But this nurse, who seems to think she knows my symptoms better than my parents and I do, disregarded what my parents said and lied to the other staff about their consent because she felt that she was right in this situation. Now thanks to this nurse, I'm going to be forced to take the medicine that ruins my mood and appetite on this trip even though my parents explicitly said they don't want me to take it.  I tried to explain to the other staff at school that my parents didn't agree with the nurse, but they didn't listen. They were patronizing, handling me as if I was just denying my parents' ""decision.""What do I do about this? is there anything I CAN do? I want to report this but I feel like I won't be taken seriously. "	"Take the adderall, leave it in your bags?"	b3wluk	Advice	1	0
why can nothing good happen?	"i probably sound like a loser but i feel so jealous and worthless. there's a girl I really like and I'm getting the vibe that im just another guy to her. she snaps me everyday but probably to keep our streak alive i guess. the part that upsets me is that I see her talking to all my friends and it just really sucks. i feel all bad inside. im really shy and don't even know how to talk to girls. i feel like crying. i don't get it. people will say move on from her but I don't know how, I've never had a relationship before and I don't know how anything like that works. i feel so ducking sad."

Freshman (18M) has a huge crush on me (19F)	"I'm a sophomore in college and I met this new freshman a few days ago. We're in marching band together and he's SO sweet and handsome but he seems to have a HUGE crush on me. Ex: he asked me to hang out multiple times, asks me deep questions when we're alone, followed me around at a party, laid his head on my shoulder.He's been super thoughtful and sweet and I wish I could date him but he's REALLY naive and I don't want to take advantage of him. At first he seemed really smooth by asking for my number and asking to hang out but then later he told me the only girlfriend he had he dated for 1 month. Also, he's a devout Catholic so I can't imagine he has much experience on that field. This kid has fallen head over heals for me in like a week but he seems vulnerable and I just don't want him to get hurt. I also want him to explore independence his first semester of college and I think I would be doing him a disservice by setting up a relationship.I really like him and I think he's boyfriend material but it would be too selfish of me to let this continue.

I'm 18 and don't know what to with my life.	"I have no friends, no work. I have everything I need from my parents e.g. food, money, clothes etc. My confidence is stupidly low. I get extremely nervous talking to just about anybody. Its weird because i know what i want to say in my head but when it comes out its nothing like how i thought it. My daily routine: I usually eat, play video games, watch YouTube, browse reddit then go to sleep. I just don't know what I'm doing anymore. I feel depressed and cry feeling sorry for myself but I have no motivation to actually do anything about it. I'm not suicidal but there are times when I've thought dying wouldn't be so bad.

What do you do when you’re not good at anything?	"Hi my name is Rachael and I am 20 y/o. Ever since I was 12 I asked myself “What am I good at?” And I still haven’t answered that question. I tried sports, I have exercised induced asthma and I suck at running. I played tennis in high school and have been trying to go to the gym since I was 18 but no matter how many times I tried it doesn’t stick. Ever since I could remember until the end of high school I was really into music, so I tried picking up a few instruments like the piano and guitar. I even took lessons for the piano for about two years. I never progressed past a beginners book and now I can’t play anything no matter how many times I practiced. I tried art like crocheting and painting but again I just wasn’t good at it. It’s not like I haven’t given these things enough time, because I’ve given them all years, I’m just not good at anything."

Flaky Friend. What would you do?	"I have a friend who I’ve known for about 1.5 years now. My husband and I both get along with him super well. We are interested in the same hobbies, shows, music, etc. and generally have a lot of fun together.The problem is that we rarely get to spend time with him because he is a major flake. When we make plans to see him (which we are always the first to initiate conversations or plans), he will only have one day that works for him in the next couple weeks. My husband and I will say something like, “We’re free on Monday, Tuesday, and during the weekend. When are you free?” He will say something like, “Only Monday works, maybe.” In any case, he always seems wishy-washy with setting a date.I have thought, maybe his life is just crazy busy.  My husband and I both work full time jobs. I work about 50 hours a week, so I get that. But we always try to make time for him. He currently only works part time.Once the day rolls around, we will get a text saying, “I’m gonna be a couple hours late.” Which eventually turns into canceling at the last minute after we’ve readjusted for two hours. There is never any explanation. Sometimes an apology.  And then the cycle continues. It is literally like this 85% of the time.We have not brought up this issue to him (which I would normally do) because he’s a very anxious person and sensitive. He tends to shut down when confronted and I don’t want to chase him away completely (which I realize sounds silly, but we honestly care about him.)In the end, both of us just end up feeling hurt and stepped on. We wonder if he cares about our friendship because he never initiates. We get angry when we plan our lives around seeing him and then he cancels, which inconveniences us, but more importantly, makes us feel like he could care less about us.So I guess my question is: 1) Am I even justified in being upset about this?  2) If you were in my situation, what would you do?"

How long should I wait for my landlord to reply to his email?	"I just moved in to a rental apartment a month ago. Something under the kitchen sink is leaking. It only leaks when the faucet is running. At first it was just a small leak. On Tuesday evening I emailed the landlord asking him to come have a look. He emailed back pretty quickly, saying it sounded pretty minor, and he asked that I try to tighten up some of the connections under the sink myself.I was not able to fix the issue, and I know nothing about plumbing so I was actually scared to make the issue worse by tinkering around under the sink. By Wednesday morning (yesterday), the leak had gotten bigger. I've stopped using my kitchen faucet at all - it doesn't leak as long as the faucet is off.I emailed the landlord again yesterday morning saying it's not fixed, and have not heard back from him yet.It's now been about 24 hours since I emailed him. How long should I wait before I contact him again? I don't want to piss him off by being rude or pushy, but I'm also not able to use my kitchen sink right now, which is really annoying.

"I don't like the emotionally unstable girl that uses me as an emotional safe haven, what should I do?"	"I met a girl a while ago who seemed to be pretty normal so when she asked to add me on snapchat I did so without much thought. We started chatting normally but after maybe 3 days (Might have been 2) she started getting really personal and began to give me in depth information about her life that I didn't ask about in any way. She became attached to me really quickly because I'm ""Easy to talk to"" but it's mostly because the majority of my replies are things such as ""Wow.. That sucks... Really?... I can't imagine,"" ect. Most of what she talks about is her severe deppression and anxiety, mental/emotional abuse from her father, severe and daily bullying at school, and her thoughts about ending it all. She says I'm her rock and the only real friend she has, but in all honesty, I don't like her at all. I don't want the burden of being her emotional safe haven or listening to her go on and on and on every day. She lives a few states away from me and doesn't know where I live, go to school, any of my friends, ect. So I could just block her everywhere and that would be the end of it for me. The only reason I haven't done so (and why I'm making this post) is because I'm fairly confident she would go through with it and end it all. I would probably never hear about it and nobody would know my involvement with her but I may be the only thing keeping this person from going through with it. Would I be an wrong for cutting my connection with her off and possibly letting something like this happen just because I don't want to listen to her anymore?"

Hair advice	"I went to the salon a week ago, looking to get my hair done a peach/pink colour. I got it bleached, toned, and dyed. I ended up with a very strawberry blonde, almost golden colour instead of the pinky shade I wanted, even though I showed her pictures. I payed a lot of money for this, and I’m not looking to spend a lot more fixing this. I can even supply a picture if it would help. I want to get my hair done a nice pinkish peach colour, almost like cotton candy. If anyone could help that would be great. I’m wondering if buying my own pink dye will help or if it will just come out neon pink? I don’t have the money to go back to the salon and get it done.

Bad relationship with my sister	"I’m 20 years old, back living at home after dropping out of second year of college. Family life has been contentious to say the least ever since I moved back in. My sister is 15 and my brother is 18. Me and my brother get along fine but my relationship with my sister hasn’t been good. Me and sister used to be great friends back when we were younger but ever since I went to secondary school, we haven’t talked. I can’t remember the last time we had an actual conversation. Actually I don’t think we have ever had a genuine conversation. I hate the fact that I have no idea how to talk to her let alone what to actually say to her. I don’t know whether it’s because she resents me for being a mean big brother or the fact that she genuinely doesn’t want anything to do with me. I really wish I knew what to say and how to speak to her. Maybe it’s just a phase that she’s going through (I understand teenage girls to a certain degree) but I’ve spoken to my girlfriend about this multiple times but she doesn’t even know what to tell me anymore. I want a good relationship with her and I hope that maybe it’s just her going through some angsty teenage phase and she’ll eventually want to talk to me. I’m just worried that that’ll never happen"	"This might sound cheesy, but how about writing a letter/email to her letting her know that you still want to be a good brother to her?"	b198hg	Advice	1	0

Help with an attendance problem in college	"So my college (SIU) has really a really strict attendance policy that I wasn’t expecting. In the policy I am allowed 3 unexcused absences and my overall grade in the class drops a full 10% out of 100 every time I miss after that. This isn’t a problem for me in most classes as I am normally present, but I miss my first class of the day or am late on a semi-often basis. This really isn’t a problem in one of my classes because my professor doesn’t really worry about it, but in one of my classes my professor is really “by the book” and has dropped my grade from an 84% to a %64 based solely on missing two days of class over my 3 day limit. Today I was finishing up a project for the class and ran into a printing issue so I was going to be a decent bit late for this class (the class is three hours long by the way, and it is completely unnecessary), and my professor would count me absent if I am too late. So instead I took a doctors note that I obtained from the on campus health center a few weeks ago and used it to digitally forge a new note for today so I wouldn’t have more points deducted for another absence. I emailed him the doctors note and my excuse for missing class, like I had done with the original note, but this time he asked to me to bring the note to class, along with the original that I had used before. I have already thrown away the original note and the fake doesn’t really exist, so I’m SOL for turning in any kind of physical proof.

"We met each other while we were on attachment.I like him because we seem to click well, he is humble, considerate and we are able to confide in each other. He opens up to me.

I need some direction.	"So my fiance and myself just moved to a new city to be closer to mother in law so she could help watch the baby while we worked and also to get out of my hometown. We moved in September.

So her boyfriend just announced that he is leaving her, has already found a new apartment and will provide her son a place to stay if he wants to. Leaving his mom with nowhere to go. It was kinda assumed by everyone that we would take her but we want that to be a last resort. We have a small house that is barely enough room for us.

How to get someone to stop pitying me?	"I just finished a difficult semester. A lot of things went wrong for me in my personal life and I realized that I didn't have any support system to get me through it. When I was at my most vulnerable, I tried to open up to a friend. They didn't really acknowledge it, but the dynamic of our friendship changed.For example, they recently invited me to a party, but they didn't really talk to me during the entire party and I found it hard to connect to the other people at the party who I barely knew. I felt very alienated and disregarded. In the end, they made several remarks that made me feel like they didn't respect me at all. Quite frankly, I found the whole thing quite patronizing and dismissive of my feelings.The thing is that I wasn't looking for pity when I told them how I was feeling. I just wanted to tell someone what I feeling because I felt totally alone with no one to tell. Plus, the pity is totally unwarranted because despite what I had to deal with, I did academically well this semester. I now also have a parttime software engineering job and a research position.

I had the chance to make out with one of the hottest chicks I've ever seen and I pushed her off of me because she was extremely drunk and I was sober. (17M)	"So me and my friends went to this crazy street dance and later in the night some chick points me out of my group of friends, stumbles over to the point where I had to catch her from falling, and than puts her hands on my face and goes in for the kiss. She was way out of my league and looked to be around 20 or 21, but way too drunk and me not drinking a thing pushed her away.I know I did the right thing but I do have some feelings of regret. My friends said if they had an opportunity with a girl that attractive they would have not even flinched at the opportunity. It was by far the most attractive chick to ever do something even close. I have so many mixed feelings and hope I can get some advice on whether I did the right thing or what you would have done in my position."

"Doubting which career path I should choose, need advice on how to make that decision"	"I'm about to reach that point where I have to choose what to do study and basically my future career.I'm doubting between fashion designing and building engineering.3 years ago I was sure I'm going to be an engineer, and made my parents to be all hyped about it. Then, few months ago, I started to learn sewing and I fell in love with it. My grandma was very excited and she would love to see me going to the fashion industry.On the one hand I'm not a mathematical person, not to the point where being an engineer is impossible, but it would not be easy.But on the other hand, engineers earn a lot, and at the end of the day we all need money.

"I want to move to pursue my goals, my fiance does not."	"I moved to California from Nebraska nearly 3 years ago to be with my current fiance who I have been with for nearly 4 years, we have gone through a lot together of course and have found new interest in life along with new career paths and goals.   However her heart and friends are here in California, mine however, is not.   I'm a very passionate reptile keeper and breeder, I keep various species of Monitor Lizards, Venomous Snakes and several of the largest snakes on the planet as well, however due to Californias laws, it prevents me from expanding and working with specific species I want to work with and pursue breeding and more.   Essentially, am I an asshole for wanting to move to a new state that will allow me to open the store I want to open, work with the animals I want to work with, at the cost of potentially leaving my fiance?   are my dreams and goals more important? Is it rational to pursue something I love, or stay in a state where I'm depressed and don't enjoy where I'm at in life due to feeling restricted from my goals.

TNR Lady kidnapped neighbor's dog to teach him a lesson	"My neighbor is an old man, doesn't speak English, barely has any money, doesn't have any family. All he has is his Chihuahua. He's very sweet to her and sits outside all day with her. He lives on a side street and does not walk her on a leash and she doesn't have a collar on her either. Sometimes she will run out to bark but she always comes back.This lady who lives nearby traps and neuters cats and rescues dogs, will rehabilitate them and find them owners and asks for donations to finance this. At the moment she is living with over 30 animals in her house. Yesterday she saw the Chihuahua running down the street. She knew whose dog it was but was frustrated that he doesn't walk her on a leash or have a collar on her, plus he doesn't have money nor a car so he doesn't take her to the vet; she says her nails are too long and her teeth are bad. So to teach him a lesson, she purposely took her on errands before returning her to his owner at which point she found him crying, and she berated him. He gave her $20 to thank her for ""finding"" her.  I found all of this out because she posted it on Instagram bragging about it. There are a lot of poor Cuban and Haitian communities nearby and she likes to post about how she is helping these animals despite her ignorant neighbors' objection, and will often tag her posts with derogatory remarks. I will be taking the dog to the vet to help my neighbor.  **Should I call the cops on this lady? She is very nasty towards people who don't agree with her but I worry that the good she does for the community outweighs the negative things she does.**  *TLDR: Local lady who traps and neuters cats and finds homes for cats and dogs purposely kidnapped my old neighbor's dog to teach him a lesson because she doesn't agree with how he lets her loose and because her teeth and nails are unkempt. He is too poor to take her to the vet. He paid her $20 for ""finding"" his dog. She currently lives with over 30 animals in her home.

We like the idea of being on the top floor because that means we have no upstairs neighbors but it would also be cool to have brand new hardwood and carpet.

AITA for not wanting my husband to hang a trophy caribou head in our entryway?	"My husband is a lifelong hunter, so are most of the men in his family. I got my own hunting license after we were married a few years, and I’ve gone with him for a few hunting trips. I even “harvested” my own pronghorn antelope two years ago. My husband has been planning a special hunting trip in Alaska with his family for next fall. They’ve been saving up the money for years, and he’s really excited about it. (I’m not planning on going with them for this trip. We have a daughter who will be two by next fall, plus I hate the cold.) So here’s the thing: he already has some trophy “mounts” hanging in our house. I’m fine with it as long as they’re not in “public” spaces. Our house has two stories, the top floor has the living room kitchen, etc. All of his trophies are downstairs, where we have a tv room, bathroom, and storage room/office for him. All the trophies are downstairs where people don’t generally go. But when he goes on this special caribou hunt, he wants to have it stuffed, and hang his new prized trophy in our entryway. As in, a dead reindeer will be staring straight at you when we open the door to anyone. Package delivery, friends and neighbors, door-to-door salesmen. And caribou are not SMALL animals. They have the largest antler-to-body ratio of any animal. This thing will be at least five feet tall. Which is why he feels that the entryway is the perfect place for it, it honestly probably wouldn’t fit in many other places.I have no problem with his passion for hunting, I’ve even joined him for some trips. We’ve compromised on the dead-animals-as-decor issue up until now by hanging them where most people don’t see them. He can show them off to some friends when he wants to, without having them be the focal point of the main living areas. I feel like it’s unfair to ask him not to hang it up at all, (it’s his house too, and this will be a trophy of something he’s planned for and saved up for for years) but I also don’t want to greet every single person that comes to our door with a gigantic stuffed dead animal head..."

AITA for joke-flirting at a gay bar?	"So my girlfriend's friend and his boyfriend invited us to a gay bar this weekend. The 4 of us spent most of the evening together, but at one point my gf went out with her friends because one of them felt sick. I stayed inside to mind our bags and jackets.This older dude approached me, he was obviously buzzed and he tried to start a conversation. I wasn't interested in talking until I realized he's actually my previous boss' son, which was funny so we started discussing how small the world is and all that. He and his friend then sat down at the nearby table and I let him buy me a drink, since he was buying his friend one too.I told him that I'm straight and here with my gf, but I don't think he believed me because he teased me about coming home with him so he can help me ""relax with a guy"" or something. I wasn't taking him seriously at all, besides he's like a decade older than me even if I wasn't straight and had a gf.However I found it funny that my former boss' 30-something son was hitting on me while my friend was probably throwing up outside the bar. Probably because I was already a little drunk myself and I find everything funnier when drunk.So I entertained him a little but I wasn't serious about it. That is, I asked him about the pool he apparently has at home, and what kind of drinks he has etc. but he thought I was being honest though and that I'd just leave my gf and friends and go home with him? When I rejected him he was pretty pissed off and called me a dick-tease, then left with his friend.When my gf and her friends came back I told them about what happened. My girlfriend found it funny but the guys said I *was* actually being a dick tease and that I shouldn't come on to guys in a gay bar as a joke, because they'll obviously want to take me to bed.

AITA for wanting to take a break from hanging out with my best friend?	"My best friend started developing feelings for this girl back in March. A few of our friends and I decided that we were going to try to help him get with her. At first he was excited and really wanted to get with her, and I was happy to help him. But for 6 months straight he was constantly talking about her, with no action. Now, I get it, he liked her and he was nervous to talk to her, but for 6 months straight, every topic in a conversation turned into a talk about her, and I couldn't just tell him to not think about her. One of the most frustrating parts was when he kept repeating himself on what he wanted to do, ""I really need to talk to her one on one in person"" etc, but he never followed our advice .Jump ahead to the end of the 6 months and he actually began going out with her. GREAT. I can finally stop talking about how he can get with her. Nope. This was his first relationship (he has also never kissed a girl), and I completely understand why he would be a bit nervous about doing things with her. But being messaged nearly every day hearing about their dates, or how annoyed he was at himself for not going for something, it got to the point where I just ignored his messages for a couple hours because I was sick of talking about it. After 2 months they broke up, and he claims that he is over it, when he clearly isn't. Any time I mention a girl he tries to give me advice like he is some guru, ""Well when I was with my ex"" ""Bro honestly from past experience I know that.."" , but he barely even held her hand after 2 months. He still talks about her to this day and it has gotten to the point that I don't even like hanging out with him anymore, especially when it's just us two, because I know he will just bring her up and I have to say the same routine phrases over and over again, ""No you're not in the wrong"" ""No I understand why you were nervous"" ""Don't be mad at yourself"" etc etc.TL;DRAITA for not wanting to hang out with my friend anymore, because he will just talk about his ex girlfriend, who I had to hear about every day for the past 9 months?"

AITA for not liking a certain meat	"Okay, my brother and dad loves to hunt Deer and I have to say they taste terrible because they lac flavor aka fat so it just tastes bland to me and I would rather eat: Cow, Chicken, Pig, Turkey, Crab, Shrimp, Clams, Fish, Squid you get the point, than they tell me why didn’t I eat it, I tell them I just don’t like the texture, but they be annoyed while I don’t mind cooking myself at all I love it.

WIBTA for talking to the professor about mis-assigned grades?	"So for my college math class, I noticed that a homework grade was accidentally counted as a quiz grade. For many people, this is a boost to their grade, but I do notoriously bad on homeworks, so I now have a failing quiz grade. The poor performance on the homework is my own fault, but it should be only 5% if my grade instead of 15%. My argument is that this mis-classification was a mistake anyway, but I know I would be harming at least a few peoples grades in the class.WIBTA?"

WIBTA for leaving somebody with no furniture?	"This summer I let two friends who were made homeless by their parents (they are both mid twenties like me) move into the 3 bed house I rented after my last housemate moved. They continued to turn it into a party house, lose their jobs and spend all their money on drugs.I was sick of paying for them and their dog to live and sick of my home being full of drugged up strangers. I moved into my friends house and let them keep the house in my name with my deposit with the landlords permission so they weren't homeless. All I asked was them to pay the money they owed me after I was lending them money constantly. I ended up in a motorbike accident a week after moving and am unable to work. I am also a full time student. My savings were blown moving and looking after them and being unable to work has left me a bit broke.For the past few months every week they have given me more excuses and not paid me a penny, but have been able to buy drugs and alcohol and don't care a bit that I'm struggling. My parents have been helping me but they don't have a lot of money. I want to take the furniture I left them (sofas TV fridge freezer washing machine ect) and tell them I am selling them. I don't think I will sell them but I don't think they deserve my things any more. They will go into storage in my parents garage most likely. They have just started new jobs and said it will be weeks before they give me any money.It's just before Christmas and I feel bad leaving them with nothing but I feel like I am being taken advantage of here.

WIBTA if I complained about the way a restaurant served me food	"This post isn’t about my actions, but my dad’s. This happened a few weeks back when I was on vacation. My dad and I got to our hotel and decided to go out for food. We found a Chinese place to eat and walked there.When we got there, we were very disappointed. The restaurant (which was very small, which is fine) served us food in those white styrofoam boxes. When we got the food, mine was fine, but my dad was angry. I forgot what he ordered exactly, but he did not get what he wanted. He ordered some meat (pork or chicken or something) that was supposed to be cooked twice, but was cooked only once. However, he didn’t complain and just ate it.When we left, I asked him why he didn’t ask them to cook it again. He said he didn’t want to be an asshole. His reasoning was that they were about to close (we come at like 8:50 and they closed at 9:30) and that they just did a bad job to get us out faster. He also said that cooking it twice takes a lot of time.That made no sense to me. We still paid the full price for food we did not get and they never even mentioned their laziness to us. Would he have been the asshole if he had asked them to cook it again?"	Where does the styrofoam fit into this?	ce5xyb	AmItheAsshole	0	0
AITA for wanting to adopt in the future?	"Hi,I'm a 20 year old male, single child of parents that divorced when I was 2, so I feel like I understand (to an extent) the issues of orphans and sympathize with them.That being said, I had a conversation with family where they were asking about ""any new girlfriends?"" and we eventually got to the topic of kids, where I said I'd rather adopt in the future since I find it selfish to bring a new child into the world when so many go unloved.This annoyed my mom who didn't want her blood line to end with me (she's also an only child), and other family members said that it wouldn't be fair if ever I got married since ""I can't understand what it's like to be a mother"" and I shouldn't take that right away from my future wife.So AITA?

WIBTA for wanting my brother to replace what was destroyed under his supervision?	"Okay, so a couple of days ago I had to go to work and I left my pencil pouch filled with my art supplies on my bed behind a closed door. Note that my door doesn’t fully close and it used to have a latch on it but the latch broke, so there was nothing to stop my door from being opened.   My older brother was in charge of watching my family’s 3 large dogs (Two English Mastiffs and a Great Dane). I come home at 8 o clock and find that my leather pencil pouch, pencils, gel pen, and all my mechanical lead has been eaten and ripped apart.   My parents say that I should have put my supplies away and not left them on my bed but I think that my brother should have watched them better.   I want him to replace my supplies because he should have kept a better eye on them (although he did say that he kept them out of my room several times, I doubt that he did.)  Am I the asshole here?"

AITA for being annoyed with my room mate and her girlfriend and their constant PDA?	"So I'm in college and live in an apt. I live with my best friend bf and a few other people. My best friend has been dating a girl for like 4-5 months. From day one her girlfriend basically moved in. They are always here and most of her stuff is here. Usually I don't mind bc I love her and her girlfriend. But, they constantly spend time with each other. She is here when my bf friends up, they drive to class together, eat every meal together. The only time they aren't in each other's company is when they're sleeping, showering, or in class. They do this weird little baby voice to each other constantly and it drives me up a wall. They are always kissing and touching and being cute but its ALL THE TIME. I know its not technically PDA bc its in our apt. but I feel like I'm third wheeling where I live. They only spend time with each other and the people they live with including me. They are so sucked into each other constantly that sometimes I'll be saying something but they ignore it bc they're whispering in their baby voices to each other. Maybe I'm just a cynical lonely person who need to let other people be happy. Am I an Asshole?"

AITA for going on a work trip the week my wife returns to work from maternity leave?	"My wife gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl four months ago. She is a blessing but can be a handful, as most parents can confirm. My wife luckily was able to get 6 months maternity leave through her company (awesome!) but has been dreading going back to work come the end of January. I just started a new job a few weeks ago and was just told that I, along with 5 others from the company, are being sent out of state for a 4-day long work trip. The trip begins the Monday my wife goes back to work. My wife, understandably so, was very upset about me not being around during a time that she will be stressed, scared, sad and all-around overwhelmed. After a night of arguing, I attempted to explain that there are a lot of moving parts with this trip and because I am a crucial part of what makes this trip work, I am required to be there. She was still so upset that I pulled every string I could to allow me to leave Tuesday morning instead of Monday, giving her assistance and support on her first day back. She said “that’s better but still not ideal” and continues to be emotional and distant from me. She will have help from our nanny during the day but is still making me feel like I’m just going golfing with buddies for a week and leaving her alone without considering her feelings.

WIBTA if I changed hair salons without saying anything after being a long time client (2 years)?	"I have been going to the same hair salon/stylist for a little over two years for cut and color. I have no complaints about the service really, always happy with my hair and the stylist is nice. She goes the extra mile to make sure that her clients are happy. My reasoning for switching sounds kinda silly considering that it has nothing to do with the stylist or services but my current salon is located downtown and I hate driving there. I have pretty bad driving anxiety as is, and I just really hate the location and trying to find parking down there.  I wish I could find a salon maybe closer and in a less cramped location. I know that this is a professional service that I am paying for, and we aren't really friends beyond chatting while I'm there an occasionally liking each others instagram posts but I would feel guilty if I just ghosted. I also wouldn't even know what to say if I did tell her I was deciding to stop going to her or if thats even necessary to mention it or just do it."

AITA for being angry at my Mom?	"So today I got into a fight with my mom. I sat down next to her, and complained that I didn't really want to go to my best friends birthday party, because there were only three other people there, one person I can't stand, and two others that I don't know, but needed to go, because it's my best friends sixteenth birthday party, and I know that it's important to her.She then asked me, why the hell I really didn't want to go, and I told her that I didn't want to talk about it. Then she said: "" Well, then stop complaining to me."" I got angry, and went into my room, to calm down. A few minutes later she barged into my room, demanding to know what was up with me. I kept telling her that I didn't want to talk about it. Then finally she pushed me to tell her. I only gave in, because I feared that she'd take my phone or something else away. After I finally told her what was up with me, she said that I couldn't always keep my feelings bottled up inside me, and that I needed to talk to my friend about it. She's right about that, but- You should've heard the tone of  voice she said it in. Its that tone of voice parents always complain about, when their kids use it. Also, my friend is one of these people that hates confrontations, and always says what the other person wants to hear, so it wouldn't help anyway.Now my Mom is angry at me, and refuses to drive me to my friends birthday party. I already made arrangements with my best friend. I'm having her Mom pick me up. Haven't told my Mom about that. I'm afraid she'll get even more angry, if I tell her, because she can't stand my friends mom. (That's a whole 'nother story)So, AITA here?"

AITA for choosing to go to my friends birthday party on valentines?

I’ve been stressed with uni exams lately and when they suggested that date I didn’t remember it was valentines. We are a group of about 10 people and the only date where we all coincide is that one. They’ve also decided to celebrate it at my flat.My gf has got really upset with me because of this first off blaming me for that being the only date and because I was inconsiderate (even though I didn’t choose the date). She lives 5 minutes from where I am and refuses to come to the party. I’ve suggested lunch together and maybe after the party going to sleep with her at her flat but apparently I’ve already ruined her valentines and she doesn’t want to meet up for lunch that day. I didn’t suggest the date, it’s the only date all my friends can meet up, I’ve suggested other ways of meeting up that day and I wouldn’t mind having a “proper” valentines date night the following day.

AITA for asking my wife to refrain from further drinking when alone with our 3yo son	"We’re on a family holiday and it’s all inclusive. It’s 9pm and our 1yo is on her last legs and I suggest taking her back to the apartment. My wife agrees, she is going to hang out for another hour at the bar before the entertainment starts that our 3yo has been excited about. Sure, I say.My wife can handle her drink and I trust her fully with our kids but at this stage she’s on Prosecco number 8 (I’m guessing, her glass was being topped up by waiters throughout the evening). I do know when she’s getting drunk however, so I asked her to take it easy if I was going to head back without her. Obviously this went down like a lead balloon and she took it as me trying to bring her down. That was not the intention, I wanted to ensure she was fit to manage a (likely) very tired and crabby 3yo or (just as likely) hyperactive one.As it stands I’m anxiously waiting for them to come back but as bad as it feels, I’d hope she’d have the same concerns if the situation was reversed."

AITA for wanting to go to a concert with another girl?	"First ever post on Reddit in my 2+ years of lurking so forgive me if my formatting or anything else is not correct. For context im a 24 year old guy and my girlfriend is the same age. So last Saturday I went out with a couple of friends whilst my girlfriend stayed at home, one friend was there that I haven't seen in a while but have been friends with for over 8 years. The friend is a girl.The night goes on and she eventually tells me she has a spare ticket to a concert on the following Thursday and she's upset because the person she was supposed to be going with won't be going with her anymore. It's for a band that I used to enjoy when I was younger so I checked my schedule and I was free that evening and said I would go with her so she wouldn't have to go alone. Obviously she's very happy as she thought she was going to be going alone and I'm happy because I get to see an old band that I used to like and get to spend the night with an old friend.My girlfriend on the other hand is not happy. At all. She is saying that I'm not allowed to go with her because ""just you and her going to a concert is basically a date."" For the sake of honesty and to get an unbiased opinion it is worth noting that when me and this friend were 16/17 we shared a drunk kiss - which my girlfriend knows about. But in the 7 years after nothing of a romantic nature has happened between us.  I can't understand my girlfriends reasoning because in my head I know how platonic our friendship is and it is the furthest thing from a date that I can imagine, it's just two friends enjoying a concert together. I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 3 years, living together for just over 1. We've been arguing about it for the past few days, the concert is tomorrow and we can't come to any kind of agreement, she flat out refuses to listen to my reasoning and is telling me I can't go.

She is turning 25 next week and her fiance basically told her that he isn't doing anything for her birthday, she isn't a child anymore and should grow up.

I also help my dad out with chores since he isn’t in the best medical shape and help my mom shop and do chores around the house. My mom actually appreciates me being around since she is almost 70 now and can’t do everything like she used to. My 26F girlfriend also lives at home and hates it. She’s been wanting to move into an apartment with me and while I’m totally for it I want to find the right place. We took a tour of one place last weekend and while it was okay it was honestly too small and the rent was reasonable but I have seen lower. I told her that I want to find somewhere but it might take awhile for the right place to pop up. She seemed upset but said that was ok. I told my friend about this and he said I was being too picky and was being an asshole since she hates living at home and since I can easily afford to move out I should do it since I’m too old to be living at home.

AITA for locking the door to the room while my roommate was in the shower?	"My roommate and I share one dorm room. She has a bad habit where, sometimes, she’ll leave to take a shower and not take her key or cell phone with her. Usually it’s not a problem because I’m in the room. However, I do have a really ingrained habit of taking my key out and locking the door, so if I’m not in the room and she’s not in the room, I will do it without thinking about it. A couple of weeks ago she went to go take a shower in the morning, while I was asleep. I got up, got ready to leave, and locked the door on the way out. Fortunately I was just going to grab something for breakfast so she was only stuck outside the room in her towel for a few minutes.Yesterday, same situation. Woke up, she was gone. I was running really late so I rushed my routine and locked the door on the way out. When I got back after class, she was wearing the clothes of another girl in the dorm and PISSED. She asked why I didn’t look for her to see if she was in the showers when I saw she was gone and the door wasn’t bolted. I said I didn’t really think about it and asked why she didn’t call me. She doesn’t know my number by heart and couldn’t find anyone with it. One of her friends was there and remarked as though he was trying to be a peacekeeper that I REALLY should have checked to see if her towel was gone after the first time she got locked out and, if it was gone, gone to the showers and called around looking for her. I thought this was a little ridiculous and said so in a joking tone, but nobody was laughing. Now I have a bunch of people pissed at me because she’s more popular than me in the dorm.I wasn’t trying to teach her a lesson or anything, I honestly didn’t even think about it. However, thinking on it now, I don’t really get why it’s on me to always keep track of whether she’s showering to see if I should lock the door, when it would be so easy for her to take her key.AITA?"

And every time we get a pick or a touchdown or something, she yells “Woohoo!” Before we can see the play even start. I can handle it when we’re not playing anyone good, but it’s kinda annoying when we play auburn or Clemson or any rival team. I love her to death and I would feel bad if I told her to stop, but none of us have the heart to tell her we don’t like it. Should I tell her to stop?

The score is all instrumental, no lyrics, but the original song mentions the N-word (no hard r) a few times. Since we were just playing the tune, I didn't think that was a problem.I gave my students the piece and the school received a complaint a few days later. Admin asked me to remove the piece from my selection, and that was that.

WIBTA for not telling allowing our third roommate to sublease?	"I’m living with two other people, after a falling out last year the third person said she wouldn’t be living with us because of myself and the other person. She would continue to pay her 12 month lease but wouldn’t be living with us. My friend and I were completely shocked by this. We felt everything was going great between us. The only thing we really did *against* her was last year we refused to participate/share harder drugs with her. She’s 90 pounds and couldn’t handle even basic things, weed. We told her that we didn’t support her cigarette habit she just picked up and we were worried for her. We tried talking to her only to be ignored. This was one of our best friends that pretty much threw us aside for god knows what reason. Well, after reading through our already signed 12 month lease, I noticed the sublet section of contract says “no sublease will be permitted unless agreed by **all** tenants.” She hasn’t even offered a person, but would t be an asshole move to just deny anyone she might recommend, if she ever decides to? So some reasoning/justification: 1. my other roommate was recently raped and living with strangers is a no-no for her. It’s not as simple as just interviewing a few people and finding someone she is comfortable with either. 2. We agreed to a three person house because we were under the impression all three of us would be living there, not two and a stranger. If my other roommate and I wanted a two person house, we would have signed a lease for one."

Not only that but she talks so much that sometimes i am getting headaches just from listening to her voice for hours everyday. I hate eating dinner with my family or watching a movie when she's also there. The things she talks about are also really stupid and i couldn't give less f*cks about the drama going on in her class or what her favourite k-pop singer did yesterday morning. I tried to explain to her why it's rude to talk over everyone and force her stories upon people but she doesn't care. In case no one is paying attention to her, she repeats the story a couple of times until she makes sure everyone has heard it.   When i tell her to shut up because she's being annoying and obnoxious she doesn't care and just continues talking and talking and talking. My parents tell me that I am being a jerk for telling her to shut up and for saying that literally no one f*cking cares. According to them i only say it because i have something against her and that i want her to feel bad about herself.

I was put in all sorts of classes, ballet, tap, contemporary etc by my mother, who was also a dancer but dropped out because of a shattered kneecap she endured in a car accident. Since I’m her only daughter, my mother decided to force me into her dancer dreams and basically live through me. I missed much school for out of state dance competitions and abroad summer boarding schools, I even did online school for middle school and my first three years of high school online because of the competitions and programs I was enrolled in. Dance is all I know and I love the sport with everything within me as I dedicated my entire life to it, but it’s not my passion in life. I’ve always wanted to become a lawyer. My uncle is a lawyer and everything about the lawyer life style is what I’m interested in becoming. My mother? Can’t hear it. She’s helped me apply to many dance universities around the world and I even got accepted into a few extremely exclusive schools, but all I want to do is study criminal justice and become a lawyer.

I’ve tried to find out what the problem is if there is any, and I can’t seem to see anything out of the ordinary out of his own life, so from what I can tell he’s just drifting away.If that’s the case, it’s not my position to stop him. But I wanted to make it known that if he doesn’t invest more time into our group of friends, there might soon come a time where he’s not considered in the group anymore. And I really hated saying that to him because it sounds so accusatory, as if he has some responsibility or something. Like, it’s arduous where it’s supposed to be fun. I don’t know if I’m being fair or not in doing this.TLDR: Friend appeared to be drifting away, so I presented him with the ultimatum that either he invests more time in our friends group or he might not even be in the group anymore soon."

WIBTA If I went on a trip without my husband.	"Me and my husband met and began a long distance relationship a couple years ago (Canada to the US) and got married shortly after. I haven't seen my family or friends in about a year and we finally got all the necessary paperwork done for my green card and I can finally travel outside of the US again.   I started planning a trip next month for two and a half weeks back to my hometown to see all my friends and family and I wasn't sure wether I wanted him to come or not. On one hand, I'd miss him a lot and want him to see my friends and family and on the other I want a trip by myself as I've been feeling overwhelmed lately and just want some alone time with friends and family. I expressed my feelings to him and was very open about how I felt about him coming and I asked for his input and if I was being selfish etc. He said I can do what I want and he's just happy for me that i'm finally able to go back home. But he also is telling me he wants to come and visit everyone and now I don't know what to do.  I wanted some alone time away from him because I feel overwhelmed and sometimes smothered. He's a great guy and is encouraging me to make new friends here and get out more, but it's been difficult for me to start from scratch especially since I've never lived anywhere else in my life. There's nothing I would do back home that I wouldn't also do with him and I have nothing to hide from him, but lately I just want some time apart with my friends and family just one on one. I haven't had the best relationship with my mother and I've wanted to work on that for years and I just want a bit of girl time with my friends. But I also don't want to take the opportunity away from him to see my family and friends as well.  Would I be selfish for going alone? What should I do?"

WIBTA if I don't tell my mom I can't have kids	"This obviously needs some extra clarification. I'm a 22 y/o gay man, graduating from college pretty soon. I've never expressed any interest in having kids, and I'm genuinely settled on never having any.I recently got a sperm count done because I was considering donating sperm. My mom has expressed that she would want to be informed if I ever did a sperm donation, and I was about to call her and talk about it when my count came back. I'd expected to be okay, it's not like sterility runs in my family (ha), but instead I'm totally dry. Not a single sperm cell. I was a little concerned because I was hoping for that money, but that's obviously not the end of the world. I did go through a period of worry, anger and sadness, because it did make me feel like... less than a full man. I've dealt with those feelings, but now, it's something I just... don't want to tell my mom about. I never planned on having kids anyway, so it doesn't really change anything, and it's not like I was about to accidentally get someone pregnant either. I mentioned my intention to not say anything in passing to my roommate, whose been a help to me as he is actually also sterile. He argued, mostly for the sake of argument, rather than actually fully believing his argument, that by not telling my mom that I actually cannot have kids, I'm lying by ommission, and also possibly setting my younger brother up for a nasty surprise if it is in some way a genetic thing. He argued that I wouldn't hide any other disease from her, which is accurate. But this feels more personal and also less impactful. I'm not sure... AITA?"

AITA for randomly crying in a jewellery shop?	"For context, I’m a big cryer. I do it over silly things and it’s such an issue I’m trying to solve.I was out with 2 friends who were buying expensive watches (rado’s if anyone was curious). It was whatever, we were going for something to eat after so I was just looking around as they discussed buying their watches, I came and sat down with my friends and then the woman asked, ‘what are you buying?’ So I said ‘oh nothing I can’t really afford much here’(Which is true, I’m a student. My friends aren’t ) The woman gave me a dirty look and laughed, it made me feel kind of embarrassed and awkward. It caused me to well with tears a bit but I wasn’t crying. Then one of my friends asked, quite loudly if I was upset. Which caused some tears to fall.I said no I just felt a bit embarrassed. They laughed slightly and I politely said I’m going to the toilet. (So I could calm down and not embarrass myself further)I came back 5 minutes later and we went to dinner, at dinner the same friend told me I ruined their experience at the store because I was crying. Which made things worse and i started to cry again. Not dramatically just tears falling. So AITA? I didn’t mean to ruin their day"	Are you working with a therapist?	d00jqf	AmItheAsshole	1	1

AITA for not going on vacation with my family	"So, I don’t like going on vacation. Being away from home for a long time gives me really bad anxiety, on top of that I have insomnia issues and being away from home makes that 10x worse, plus I’ve had some pretty bad experiences on vacation as a child before. Honestly, I just hate it, and frankly I find it more stressful than enjoyable, between the logistics of the transport, lodging, navigating an area none of us are familiar with, and at the end of the day it’s not really worth the trouble. A day trip to the beach or the lake, or six flags or something, now that I can enjoy. A week in Florida? I’d rather die, honestly. My ideal vacation is a week off work spent with my girlfriend hanging around the house and doing stuff within the city.I’ve expressed this to my family multiple times. A few months back my mom suggested the idea of a week in Florida over the summer. My father and sister were on board but I flat out told her my point of view and that I wouldn’t enjoy it. She said “well maybe you’ll change your mind once it starts to get hot out”, told her it’s not likely and that I’m not dedicating myself to such a trip, especially so far in advance.Fast forward to now and she asks if I’m ready for Florida next week. I tell her no, I’m still not interested in going. Her and my father then flip out on me, telling me they already paid $500 for me to go and that I’m being ungrateful. I told her I specifically said I didn’t want to go and they shouldn’t have spent that money. So after an hour long rant about how I’m unappreciative, rude, that I “don’t want to spend time with my family”(which I do, just not in Florida) etc.. they’ve decided to go without me and let my cousin take my place. Not that I would’ve gone either way.While I understand that this is an opportunity I’m lucky to have, and a lot of people would kill for, I don’t think it’s fair for them to force me into a week that would be incredibly stressful and unenjoyable for me. But my family apparently disagrees. So I ask you Reddit, am I the asshole here?"	To calm them down maybe suggest a more local holiday?	crecdg	AmItheAsshole	1	0
AITA: Dad is livid because I asked him not to bring new girlfriend to my wedding	"Backstory: My dad is the type to constantly be in and out of new relationships. Lately they've lasted around a year. I find it exhausting to constantly be involved with new women, and have expressed that I don't care what he does, but I'd like to not be involved.Last night, my fiance and father had a conversation where we all agreed to place boundaries on the relationship between us and his girlfriend (this one's been about eight months) - namely that we would only have to be around or interact with her when it had to do with my sister (who is about 8 years younger). This is especially important due to our closeness in age with his girlfriend - my fiance has run into people she's gone to high school with that happen to be friends with this woman while we've been visiting my father and it's extremely uncomfortable. I'm getting married in about a month. My fiance is having a surprise bridal shower thrown for her on Saturday. Today, my dad texted me informing me that his girlfriend would be his date for the wedding and all wedding related events (including that she would be attending the bridal shower that neither my dad nor my sister or I would be, thrown for my fiance). I told my dad that we would actually appreciate it if he would attend the wedding solo so that he could focus his attention on being the father of the groom, as opposed to on his new girlfriend. Especially since none of the family have met her yet in the 8 months they've been together, and he is the type to likely go around introducing her to everyone, which I think is inappropriate to do for the first time at my wedding. He flipped. He's livid. My fiance and I think it's a perfectly reasonable request given his history and the boundaries we agreed to last night. He thinks he ""needs to fill the void beside him"" and us asking him to attend alone is the ultimate slight. He refuses to come without her, so we will probably cave and allow her to come. But really, am I the asshole?Side note: We did not ask him to pay for anything, but he has offered to pay for the cake."	INFO: Did you give your father a +1?	cweoxp	AmItheAsshole	1	1
AITA for pretending I was listening to someone's story when I really wasn't?	"Not all, but most of the time I'm told a story or something that requires my attention for a few minutes or more, I usually end up drifting to another train a thought and completely forget the fact someone is talking to me. I did this to my grandfather last night as well as other times. He was telling me a story about his time in the Vietnam war, which I'm actually fascinated by, and he said something that made me drift off into another world. By the end of his story he asked whether or not I agree and I just took a shot in the dark and said yes. He didn't seem to notice that I wasn't paying attention and luckily saying yes worked. While I was off in another world, I was still making eye contact with him making it seem like I actually was paying attention. I feel bad because I do this more than I like to admit. If I hear a word that reminds me of a certain memory or story in my life, then i tend to lose focus on who's actually talking to me. So reddit, please let me know if IATA or not."	I'm sorry.......

AITA for refusing to let my 10-year-old daughter out of the bathroom until she washed her hands thoroughly?	"Alright so, my 10-year-old daughter has a real problem with washing her hands. She has some developmental disabilities, hates showers and washing her hands, but she still understands why she needs to clean herself and why it’s important. These past few weeks, I’ve noticed that the underside of her fingernails are caked with dirt and who-knows-what. When she gets close, I get whiffs of garbage and sewage. I have no idea why she’s not embarrassed by this, I’m sure kids at school have noticed, I’ve sent her to go wash her hands several times and it just doesn’t work. Her mother will say “oh, but her disabilities” as though this is something she doesn’t have to learn.Yesterday, I snapped and dragged her over to the bathroom. I showed her the soap and a nail brush and demonstrated how to thoroughly wash her hands. I refused to let her out of the bathroom until she’d scrubbed her hands clean to my satisfaction. She started crying and whining that I was being mean and unfair, but I was firm on it. Finally, after she scrubbed her hands several times, she showed me that they were clean. I said, “That wasn’t so bad, right? If you do it often it won’t even take that long.” She nodded, I gave her a hug, and that was that. My wife came up to me and started screaming at me for imprisoning our daughter and treating her like she was a 3-year-old. We’ve had so many disagreements over this. I said that she was treated our daughter like a child for not enforcing rules just because she has some disabilities, and asked her if she wanted our daughter to grow up to be a functional adult or not. My wife said “you abused and terrified her, if I was smart I would take her and leave” and I told her if that is what she wants, fine, but I have our daughter’s best interests at heart.AITA?"

"AITA for telling this one acquaintance to ""not eat my food if you don't like it""?"	"This one acquaintance (we'll call him Alan) and I are not friends. He's only a friend of a friend of a friend but he usually tags along with my friend group for social things. To me, he's a little bit social awkward but that's besides the point. &amp;#x200B;Yesterday, friends and I threw ourselves a random potluck party last night just because. Since I can't cook or bake, I mentioned in the group chat that I'd be bringing ham rolls. Alan responded to the message, asking what kind of ham rolls that I'd be bringing. I answered ""it's just ham, cream cheese and pickles."" Then he replied, ""well I don't like pickles...I might just eat the cream cheese and ham and then throw all the pickles away."" &amp;#x200B;I was really offended by this comment. First, while it's ok not to like pickles, do you have to really text it to the group for everyone to see? Second, I don't care if you don't eat them at the party, but saying you'd throw them away to the person making them is quite insensitive. I didn't respond to Alan in the group chat. I just let that go.&amp;#x200B;Fast forward to the party. Alan asked me about the ham rolls again. I casually told him in a joking way, ""if you don't really like pickles, then don't eat them...it's perfectly ok....I don't want to waste food."" He then said, ""wow okay.."" under his breathe and then walked away. &amp;#x200B;I instantly felt bad because it sounded harsh but that's not my intention at all. Because he did say he'd throw all my pickles away in the group chat and my mind was just unconsciously referring to that.

AITA for skipping my sister's graduation?

Korea and flew in a few days ago to the US for her graduation. We all attended the Friday ceremony, including me, and I could tell my parents were pretty mad at me as they seldom talked to me.The reason is because I told them two weeks ago that I would not be attending the Saturday ceremony as my best friend and I had organized an overnight trip to Death Valley. My best friend is moving to the UK next week for his new job and long story short could only find the time for our trip during my sister's graduation weekend.My parents were understandably upset when I told them two weeks ago, saying stuff like how I could choose friends over family, but I thought they would eventually cool off before we all got together yesterday, so I was surprised that they didn't.

I get up and go in the kitchen and someone else’s food is nuking. I got a little offended and pulled their food out mid-run and put mine in for the remaining 2 minutes. Well the culprit comes in while I’m doing that and we have this passive aggressive conversation. Me: my food needed more timeHim: well why didn’t you come in when it beeped?Me: I did. My office is across the hallway ...awkward standing around in the kitchen...Me: guess it’ll be nice when we get the 2nd microwave in here...awkward countdown continues...I grabbed my food when there was 30 seconds left and ran.

Lots of people shaking my hand, lots of compliments. Out of the blue, I hear her voice call my name... she has a hand raised rather enthusiastically to high-five as if we're close (we *were* close, in a sense, long ago when people teased we were a couple). And I just... I walk past her.And it felt *soooooooooo* good. More than the sum total of girls I approached this year combined, the phone numbers, the rejections I braved to become a better man and learning how to move on. She was the epitome of the dating life I wanted to leave behind: nice guy texts she eventually stopped responding to, driving her around, having platonic lunch together. She was the final straw that cracked my nice-guy dating paradigm. It made sense to just fade away and have some self-respect... so greeting her a happy birthday (months ago) was the last thing I ever did before we just kinda stopped being friends.I didn't even have a smug face on, I just took the coffee I ordered at the nearby stall and continued walking.

AITA for not wanting to hear about my best friend's relationship problems anymore?	"My best friend is a great person, but she could really use some work with picking good partners for herself because the past countless relationships of hers (including this one she's in now) are always the same: she meets a guy she barely knows, starts dating him shortly after, gets into problems with the guy, vents to me about it and vows to end the relationship when really the cycle just continues until the relationship miraculously ends and she gets with another guy in the same manner.      To be fair, almost all of the situations she gets into aren't her fault, as the dudes she dates always screw her over, but after seeing this happen every single time with every single guy she dates, I'm starting to think that this really is all her fault for not learning from her past experiences and not sticking to her preferences (or just not date anyone crazy). I've become mentally exhausted from hearing her vent about the same relationship problems all the time, but she comes to me because she wants my opinion on what she has to say, and she's my close friend, so I feel obligated to hear her out. I've also been tired of giving her advice only for her to do nothing with what I've told her. I don't expect my advice to be followed or anything, but it's frustrating when she's always asking for it and following up with ""you're so right"" and promising that something will be done when really nothing does happen.This dilemma has made me wonder about the purpose of advice giving, and it makes me feel bad for being tired of listening to the same thing all over again when it's my best friend.

AITA for eating a lot at a wedding buffet?	"I (17M) eat a good amount of food. Based on my body type and physical activity, I've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.My aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. It was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/DJ meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.This was problematic because I needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as I had only been excused for the morning one. I ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. I only ate a protein bar during the drive, so I was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.I loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. I was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. She had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if I was still hungry I could make something when we got home.Now, I would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. I ate a good amount, but I doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.She eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. I would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. There was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.Once we left, my mom went on a rant about how I was ""making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day."" I told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and I wasn't depriving anyone else since I went back for more once most people were done.I'm not sure if I violated some social norm, but I feel like I was justified.

"AITA for not trusting my ""roommate"" and then going through his phone?"	"I've been letting a friend of mine who fell in a rough spot crash with me for the past couple of months. I otherwise live alone. It hasn't been terrible for the most part. He offered to help out around the place and I only asked for money once with the idea being that he save up to get a place of his own (he has a stable job, just needs to get on his feet.) But then as I think is usual in ""new roommate"" situarions, little things keep coming up like using my stuff without asking, begging me to buy him cigarettes, and the apartment smelling like weed when I come home after 10-12 hour shifts. I have absolutely nothing against weed, I just felt it was disrespectful and told him that directly, same thing with going through and/or using my stuff without asking. After all that, I also found out he had one of my neighbors (who I've never met) over in my place without me knowing, when I clearly stated before that I'm not cool with someone I don't know in my apartment. He swore up and down that it was just for a beer and a movie, and I did believe him. Even so, I gave him the deadline of a full month to be out already because it became clear that the situation wasn't working.Tonight, I let the feeling of slowly deteriorating trust for this person that I consider to be a friend get to me. I ended up looking through his phone, and of course, in his gallery, found a video of him sucking some dude's dick in my bed from a full week prior to the aforementioned neighbor incident. I feel horrible for going through his stuff, especially since he's in the process of getting out, but also bad that I confirmed my feelings of mistrust and like I was disrespected. I'm conflicted about whether or not I should say anything and expedite the moving-out process, or just chill out and let it run its course.

AITA for cutting my sister out of my life?	"To start off, my oldest sister, battling cancer for over 15 years unfortunately passed away 6 months ago. She had a wonderful husband (lets call him Tom). They were HighSchool Sweethearts, He took care of her day and night as well as their 3 kids. Taking time off work to help take them to school, sports, etc while she was on chemo/fighting cancer. We were all very close and did everything together. &amp;#x200B;As of a couple days ago, I found out that her husband and my other sister are now in a relationship and have been secretly together for a couple weeks. I obviously had lots of mixed emotions about this. Mostly anger and hurting of course. Since finding out, lots of arguments ensued between my mother and sister and Tom. Things got ugly and my parents and I have pretty much cut my sister and Tom out of our lives. &amp;#x200B;As of today, they have made it official on Facebook and other social media. The frustrating part is that everyone seems to be happy for them and on their side, so to speak. So Reddit, Am I The Asshole for not supporting their relationship?

AITA for giving my husband instructions?	"Hey all,I (F26) recently gave birth to my first child (now 6 months old). My husband (M28) and I are super excited to start this new journey. We decided, for a myriad of reasons, a certain kind-of complex system on who will stay at home with kids. My husband and I both stayed home during the first 6 months and both took whatever parental leave we could. Then, I went back to work and he quit his job to be a full-time parent.In order to make sure our daughter is raised correctly, I made a list of things for my husband to help him out. That he would have a better knowledge on when to feed, sleep, etc. with our kid. I thought it would be only be nice for both him and our kid to benefit from Motherly instinct. However, my husband, instead of being appreciative like I expected, got insulted and felt that I was patronizing him.

AITA For Pointing Out A Lady Might Be Deaf In Front of Another Deaf Woman?	"Hopefully this won’t be to long but earlier today I was at the local store getting groceries with my Mom. We temporarily parted ways so I could grab a few items for her. As I get to the cereal aisle I notice there is a woman in front of the cereal I need signing at her son who is having a fit, no big deal. Wait until she’s done and apologized for being in her way, she looks at me funny. Oh well. We get to the cash register and we’re checking out, same lady comes up behind us and starts unloading her stuff. Her lettuce lands on some of our stuff, my Mom turns around and tells the lady it rolled over placing it back for her. She makes a joke but the lady is showing no signs of hearing her. My Mom is a person who likes to joke at the register so she keeps trying to joke more with her but lady says nothing, shows no sign of acknowledgement to what she had said. I point out to my mom what I had observed earlier and mention she might be deaf. Of course, she might not have been deaf and was just ignoring us. I turn back around to the cashier and notice she’s giving me a dirty look. She had hearing aids in and I didn’t even register it. I wanted to apologize but the cashier just didn’t look like she wanted to hear from me so I left it. My Mom thinks it was alright, I was just point it out to her to prevent her from possibly annoying the lady behind us but the cashier really looked like she was pissed and wanted to say something.

AITA for not wanting to talk to my brother (15) after a traumatic car accident?	"I (20M) live at home with my mom and my brother. We are very different in terms of our personalities and our outlooks. We butt heads frequently because he seems to think I’m lazy and stupid due to me still living at home, and me feeling that he is unappreciatative of me working to pay for the internet, as well as contributing $100 toward my mom’s mortgage. He and I share the trauma of our father dying in a car accident three years ago, so as you can imagine this reminds us of a lot of pain and sorrow. Our great grandmother passed away 8 months ago and she left a 91 Honda Accord for me to have and pay for the insurance and gas upon me getting my licence. Last night, my brother snuck out of the house and took the car for a joy ride with his friends and in the process got in to a car wreck that totalled the car, and had had the accident happened a few seconds too early or too late would have killed him. I have been unable to stay in the same room with him nor be able to say more than a few words to him since. My mom is overcome with the thought of what might have been and wants me to talk to him. As thankful as I am that he is still alive, I feel angry. I feel like he took something promised to me and destroyed it with his carelessness. Worse still, I fear that this didn’t really change anything for him, and that he’s still gonna have the same arrogant mentality. I do realize that I will have to deal with this and talk to him eventually, but I just can’t at this time. I’m angry and I’m afraid that I’ll say some horrible things that I know I don’t mean and that I’ll regret just to make him feel hurt."

However every once in a while I pick them up if the number appears to be something I may be interested in (it may have an area code from a town I am familiar with, etc). Sometimes these are cold calls. I have a direct number at work, which means they have to have somehow internet stalked me to get my contact info, and then called me unsolicited. Sometimes I will engage them and try to quickly and politely dispatch them. However other times I just hang up without ever saying a word. This usually happens when there is the telltale 2-3 second delay between when I say hello and they start speaking. This tells me I am just one of literally hundreds of cold calls they make that day, and I feel justified in not even engaging in the 45 seconds of small talk it takes to get rid of them.

Growing up my church treated me like trash. My family and siblings were half black, poor and came from a broken home. That was plenty of reason for them to treat me like trash. I grew up and realized I hated these people and they didn't deserve my friendship. So I moved away without a word and rarely ever see them. We did do see them, they act like they are loving grandparents or something. Saying how much they missed me, how much I've grown. And here's the deal they can't remember my name. After 15 years. So I just stare at then and say bluntly ""Who are you?"" And once we get to talking about my life (so they can gossip about it) here's how the conversation goesThem: Where are you working? Me: A jobThem: But where? Me:A factory. Them: Which factory. Me: A factory.Them : But which one? Me: *firmly* A factory. Them: Oh where do you live? Me: An apartment. Them: but where? Me : downtown. Them: where downtown? Me: Downtown. And it kinda drops from there. Now I don't do this to everyone.

The small restaurant I work for appears to not being paying me in full (Idaho)	"I am a server at a small restaurant. Its a higher end affair so the tips are pretty good. I’ve been working for about a year and a half and was promoted to manager at the end of March 2019.  I was working about 30 hours a week at $4 per hour plus tips. Now my contract included the following pay structure. $8 per hour plus tips $300 a month for 15 hours of social media management Up to 20 hours per week at $20 per hour for management dutiesA monthly bonus of 25% of food and labor savings  Over the past month the owners couldn’t make payroll, so they told me I would get zero management hours for the month, even though I still had the responsibilities, and tasks that were roughly 20 hours a week of work. They also canceled mine and coworkers shifts so they could work and didn’t need to pay them the hourly wage. I understand they can probably cut shifts, but can they just decide not to pay me for management hours if that’s what I’m doing? I also dug into my data and found that I was eligible for the bonus 4 times to date, and have been paid $200 twice. Which is peculiar because I don’t see how the savings would be the exact same both months and come out to a nice round number. They dont want to give me access to the data to determine this. I think because they don’t actually know how to calculate it. Are they obligated to give me the data?

[USA][Ohio] My immigrant husband recently learned from the Social Security Administration that his first name is formatted differently on his SS card v. the SS database.

"My husband’s birth country doesn’t have middle names, so people often have multiple first names.

He immigrated last summer. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (including his Lawful Permanent Residence/Green Card) and the Ohio BMV have him registered asFirst name: Jean PaulSurname: NoirWhen he applied for his Social Security Number last fall, when providing the documents, we made it clear that “Jean Paul” *with a space* was his first name. **The social security card was correctly printed as, “JEAN  PAUL  NOIR.”** The Social Security Administration even addressed the envelope to Jean Paul Noir.However, by coincidence we recently learned from an agent at the SSA that he is listed as “**JeanPaul** Noir” in the Social Security database. The SSA claims this discrepancy between SS Card and SS database is not possible and they have been unhelpful in answering our questions. **Our primary questions:**&gt;Who can we contact to resolve this issue?&gt;Is it possible that the SS database contains the space between the first names but doesn’t input it on the computer screen?&gt;Will this discrepancy affect his background checks with credit companies and potential employers, etc.?

Apartment is not what was promised	"We (22F &amp; 25M) just arrived to our apartment for the first time and it’s not so great. We have toured the neighboring apartment, and then rented the one next door once it became available. Not only did we find an old pair of contact lenses on the bedroom floor, but half a Trojan condom wrapper in the corner and a sock in the heater. Neither of the two windows open, despite the landlord promising we could easily install an AC unit.

How to file Adverse Possession in MO	"Sorry for long.So in 2008 I lost my job lost my apartment and quickly lost my savings. After a couple months living in my car I decided the summer heat was too much and started sleeping/hanging out in one of the many many abandoned houses in my city. I've been here since and while I always heard others talk about squatters rights I never looked into it until recently and found out in MO that it only takes 10 years. I hit that mark in about 2 months assuming the cops don't kick me out before then and was wondering about how to file a claim for the title, as I've come to view this place as home. Plus its saved me a lot of money living here that I've been able to pay off all my collections, medical bills and other loans which I never thought I could do. I tried googling laws, but I can barely understand half the words they use on Nolo and Findlaw etc. Would I qualify for adverse possession? The law says 10 years ""open possession"". The first 6-9 months I stayed stealth, only went in and out the back door, parked my car down the street, never had any light sources at night etc. But since then I've acted like it was mine. I mow the lawn, replaced appliances and stuff inside, built a new staircase to the front door, go to neighborhood barbecues and park in the driveway. I never hooked up utilities as I didn't want to flag the possible owners or authorities, but otherwise it should be obvious someone is living there.How do I prove how long I've been there? I have photos of myself and friends hanging out in the yard or in the house from years ago, is that proof enough? Am I opening myself up to criminal charges? I've changed locks, torn out old broken appliances, forged documents so I could get mail there etc. I don't want to risk getting arrested and losing my job and having to start over again.How expensive or lengthy of a process would it actually be? The house was probably only worth 10k or 20k when I moved in and even with the work I've done can't be worth more than 40k now based on looking at Zillow. Would the corporation that owns it bother fighting for such a cheap piece of property?Thanks all."	Have you looked at property tax records to determine who does own the house?	8gr6lh	legaladvice	1	0

(TX) Child Custody and Father	"Throwaway for reasons. Basically, my (soon to be) ex husband and I had an open relationship and I had a reliable “boyfriend” while my husband had various “girlfriends”. At one point he made me choose between him and my boyfriend and I chose the boyfriend because he treated me better, treated our four kids better, and was actually responsible. Once I made my choice my ex moved out of state with one of his girlfriends and started sending $20/week for child support. Fast forward a few months, I have a new home with my now fiancé and the children and he has now moved back, now he’s living with/open relationship with a stripper who happens to be a Satanist. He only wants to see the children when his mother visits and he doesn’t send child support at all. His living conditions make me want to vomit (very unclean and he doesn’t have a bed for the children). I have videos of him PLAYING with knives in front of our youngest, he started smoking weed again (not bad but our children have said he smells “funny” and “smokes smelly things,” he claims he has a demon inside of him, and I have a lot of evidence of him being unfit in general. Whenever the kids visit him, they come back unruly and won’t listen to my fiancé at all, and our oldest is especially a handful, as she was the closest to her father. With him not having safe conditions, his girlfriend being what she is, not helping with any support at all (he claims my fiancé should pay because he is a manager at Walmart) and his claim to have a demon in him, would I be accused of alienation if I don’t allow him to have visitation until the court decides themselves? Also what else can I do? I document everything he says, including the times he’s asked to see the kids and just doesn’t show up (or if he does). I would like to know just what I can do to keep my children safe, and is there a possibility to get his rights terminated or get him a psychiatric evaluation? I believe he is a danger to the children but I don’t want to lose them because I didn’t allow visitation. He claims he wants to get full custody, but is that at all possible for him to get?"

Hertz falsely accused me of having an accident in their rental car	"I rented a car from Hertz at St. Louis airport on December 20, 2018 and returned it (also to St. Louis airport) on January 2, 2019, with no damage or any other grievances.

Sewage backing up in my Apartment.	"This is in the US in Iowa. This problem started 6 months ago. The first incident happened while I was asleep. At about 10 pm I was awoken by a smell coming from my apartment. I went to check it out and noticed that the hall next to my floor was soaked, that my restroom was soaked, and that my closet was soaked. My kitchen sink, my bathroom tube, and the sump next to my water heater all had black stuff coming out of those drains. I immediately informed maintenance and the apartment management and they set someone to tare out some of the subflooring, dry the flooring, and the next day had someone shop-vac the affected areas. They also sent someone to do ""additional preventative maintenance."" Now today I am living with the same flooring, and the same sewage filled walls. (Ok not filled but some parts are black where it was white).Today the same thing happened, but to a much lesser extent. (Black stuff only came from the sump next to my bedroom). This time they only put a snake down in the sump and are going to only shop-vac it.What are my legal rights in this case? What should I expect from my landlord in this case? Could I get charged these damages that is beyond my control if they are not addressed immediately (ei the black walls and discolored flooring)? And if so what should I do?I have evidence in a form of personal memo, maintenance reports, and pictures from this incident, as well as other incidents. (Cockroach infestation I had two years ago and another sewage issue unrelated). So proving this would be a non-issue."	What's your ideal outcome?	bixw8v	legaladvice	1	1
[US-Indiana] Babysitter committed life-threatening abuse against my daughter	"I'm using a throwaway and intentionally leaving out specifics for obvious reasons.Our daughter spent significant time in the hospital recovering from a life-threatening injury incurred at the babysitter's.  State has already done an investigation and we've been told will likely prosecute the babysitter.My insurance company also has a vested interest as they've paid out a significant amount of money because of this.

Will they take separate action?  * Historically, what's the typical outcome in these types of cases?  Can we expect the babysitter to go to jail or is it more ""slap on the wrist""/financial punishment?* We want to pursue legal action as well, primarily to cover our medical fees (already incurred and future).

Lying (kinda?) on marriage license application (PA)	"I'm in a difficult situation and could use some advice.  I'm supposed to be getting married (Philadelphia) in just under one month.

There's not enough time for me to order a new copy by mail.Here are the options as I understand them:A. Be honest, but try to convince the clerk that me not having my certified decree of divorce isn't a showstopper; I've got my Catholic Church annulment decree, which they won't grant without a divorce, and can view my case online on the San Diego court website.Downside is I don't think this will work.B. Fudge the paperwork.  Getting caught concerns me;  but if the prothonotary is able to look up my marriage record, why would they need me to answer in the first place? Also, wouldn't they be able to also see divorce records?Downside here is I really don't want to lie, aside from possible legal consequences.  I'm not trying to commit bigamy, it's a legal marriage, but...  Paperwork.C. Take time off work, several days to fly to San Diego and try to get my records in person.Downside: hundreds of dollars, time lost at work, etc.I'm kind of at an impasse and would greatly appreciate advice from people who know about Pennsylvania marriage law.

(Philadelphia PA) Job is instituting mandatory overtime for the rest of the month to meet quotas and claims Medicare/Medicaid will shut down office if unionized	"My friend works for a company that handles ride services for people on Medicaid and Medicare to get to medical services. They have locations around the country but each office is localized.Over the past couple of months, they've been getting calls from other sites, management claims it's because they're short staffed. The volume of calls has become ridiculously high due to this.They recently announced that for the rest of the month, everyone will be doing an extra hour. At staff meetings they have said they can't afford to give raises and that if staff unionizes, that Medicare/Medicaid will cancel their contract. Also, the Philadelphia location is the lowest paid from what I've seen on their job listings for the states that the new calls are coming from. Now, from what I understand, PA law says after 40 hours, they are supposed to pay time and a half. If they don't, how can we safely make sure they're paid what they are due?

[Charlotte NC] Debt from ex husbands truck	"Before my divorce my ex and I traded in our cars, I traded in my car which had no negative equity for a new truck for my ex so that he could have a cheaper payment and also with the understanding that the cars would be shared.

Now it’s been over a year since our divorce and I decided I would try to trade my car in for something with a lower payment.

Found out ex's child is not mine biologically. Seeking info on removing my name from the birth certificate and preventing future costs.

To make a long story short, in the split it has come out that my soon to be ex wife’s child is not mine biologically.

Is a rental contract that contradicts state law still legally binding?	"I’m a student living in an apartment building. Our apartment has a cockroach infestation. Per Virginia law, I contacted my landlord after making my best efforts to solve the issue myself. According to Virginia law (specifically the VRLTA) it is the responsibility of the landlord to maintain habitable living conditions. I checked with my school’s office of student living and the man I talked to confirmed that in his understanding, it is the financial responsibility of the landlord to provide pest services if the tenant is not at fault. The problem is, there is a section in my lease that says all pest control services will be charged to the tenant. This contradicts the earlier part of the lease that says that the landlord will follow all duties outlined in the VRLTA. I can’t afford the charges, and furthermore I don’t think I should have to pay them. I had to harass my landlord into even sending me an invoice/proof that the services occurred and they sent it in a file format that I can’t figure out how to open (MIME?). Do I have a foot to stand on in arguing this? I’m trying to contact some free online local legal resources but in the meantime, is there any advice or insights anyone can give?

Can I get fired for not saying The Pledge of Allegiance (FL)	"I've started as an assistant at an in home daycare run by an older couple. I love it! The kids are great and the hours work well with my college classes. I was skeptical about in home daycares, but this is a great place and not the point of this post.Every morning, the class stands to say the Pledge of Allegiance before circle time. I have my personal and moral reasons for not doing so. I would just drift off to the back, sit, and stay quiet.It hasn't been a problem the past two weeks, but today, the teacher said, ""Oh, LunatikLucy, you need to stand for the pledge next time!"" after the pledge today. The co-teacher (and her husband) kind of scoffed and said, ""It's my pet peeve when people don't (stand for the pledge.)""I smiled and nodded. I really *don't* want to stand for the pledge. It may sound silly, but it's important to me. When I go in next, I'm probably going to find something to do during the pledge- like clean up toys or wipe tables.But, if they still insist I stand for the pledge and I don't, can I get in trouble? I'm like 80% sure I can't, but I remember hearing that companies under a certain amount of employees have different guidelines about what they can fire you for- and there's like 12 employees here. I'm not making a big deal out of it. I'm not spouting off about social injustices, I'm just sitting back and not participating. If I have to, I'll say it.

Reported to the HOA for barbell training in my garage	"Las Vegas, NV - USAI live in a 3 bedroom rental home in Vegas, my garage connects to my neighbor's garage, and we share a driveway with 2 other homes on the other side (4 homes total in 1 driveway).3x a week I enjoy barbell training in my garage (squats, bench, deadlifts) and my sessions last 45-60 minutes at the most. I always make sure to lift around 11am ending at 12pm, and the latest I've trained would be 3-4pm, never at night to disturb anyone.When I train I enjoy leaving the garage open for fresh air and natural lighting. I may play music on a small music box with the volume at a respectable level, never blasting.The neighbor's house on my side that connects with my garage is an old work friend from years ago that has no trouble with me lifting (and has young kids that nap). My neighbor directly across from me is very friendly as well and often says hello and chats with me.The neighbor diagonally across from me however always gives me dirty looks and recently reported me to the HOA saying I've converted my garage into a weight room, when I still use my garage for storing my car and other things, I just happen to also use a small part of it to train in.The violation letter I received basically says the garage has to be used for storing cars and can't be converted into a recreational or living space. I use my garage primarily for storing my car, my trash cans, and various other things, but I do have a small area for my squat rack and workouts which are only 3x a week less than an hour.After I got the email about this I started lifting with my garage door closed which made me really unhappy because I lose all the sunlight and fresh air, and I wasn't bothering anyone this guy is being petty. To add salt to the wound, this asshat neighbor started putting his trash can in front of my house on purpose. Not once did he do it prior to reporting me, always put it on his side of the shared driveway, now it's always smack dab in front of my house and he does it intentionally to frustrate me.Since the primary function of my garage is to store the car and other various things, am I legally allowed to workout in my garage 3x a week, or does the HOA and my douchebag neighbor have the power to tell me what I can or can't do in my own garage?"	how does he know what you’re doing in there now?	a71g5p	legaladvice	0	0
How can I have people ship products to me safely?	"I am an Amazon seller and buy product from a store that have about 20 locations nationwide. I have been hiring people off Craigslist and paying them through Paypal Goods and Services to pay for the products, pick them up and ship them to me. Unfortunately a lot of the time Paypal holds the funds for 21 days since it considers it a ""high risk"" transaction when payments are over 1000$. The payment would go through instantly if I paid ""friends and family"" but there is no protection from Paypal. Is there any way I can legally write a contract where the person im hiring agrees that he is buying the products for me at a price?

Work asked me about medications and what disability I have. Do i have any recourse?	"This all started a couple days ago, I'm in California btw, and my companies HR department had called me and started asking questions about why I'm not engaging at work, do I have a disability, am I on medications and what are they for. I told them that I am engaging, albeit I may not smile all the time but I'm not a stone faced person by any means. I did inform them that I was on medications for a person health issue, non of which are narcotic based, but that I was not comfortable with discussing my medical conditions. The then asked if I needed to be pit on leave because they don't want me to ""be at work but not at work"". I declined and that was the end of the conversation. That happened this past Monday. I show up to work today, saturday, and I was walked out of work and had my badge revoked. I was told I'm being suspended and to call back to work on Monday to follow up with HR. To me this seems like they literally just fired me.

I have been with the company for almost 3 months and never has anyone ever said anything to me. Do i have any legal recourse?

Child Support issues	"Hello. My boyfriend has had an issue with his ex-girlfriend since I have known him. She is constantly moving, moving in with boyfriends and moving out. bringing her kids around all these new men (she has 3 girls ages 10-15) she has been with this one guy for about a year now. But is still talking to an ex, so they act like teenagers and slash each others tires, and do doughnuts on her lawn...There is SOOO much going on, we are 99% sure she is committing welfare fraud too. But now she is angry because my boyfriend got stern with their daughter. A very rare occurrence, his daughter is his entire world. He got stern because her mother left a text ""I'm keeping her this weekend"" so he asked what as sup, and no answer, he kept trying and no answer. He called and texted his daughter to no answer.. So her left a message on her phone (that apparently made her cry, according to her mother) ""it's your dad, I bought you this phone to get a hold of you not to play games, call me back."" so that unleashed a slew of text messages from the ex girlfriend. We have talked with a law firm here in Michigan called ADAM, its a law firm specially for men in child custody and divorce cases. My boyfriend has wanted to go after her for a very long time, his daughter is constantly telling us things that we feel puts her in an unsafe environment. we reported her to CPS for leaving her home all that time alone (she's 10) and CPS did nothing. We thought since the school was involved and wanting to know where his daughter has been that that would help. CPS didn't do anything, but it is on record. We need help. we plan on going to that law firm for men, but I would like to know what our steps are before going to the lawyers, like what to do, things to keep track of all that jazz."

My aunt stole my fathers life insurance from me.	I'm using a throwaway because I have family that uses reddit and I don't want them knowing my main account. I'm doing the succession for my father. I learned from my cousin that my aunt stole my fathers life insurance. He told me that the check came to my fathers house after he died and my aunt cashed it. Her name was not on the policy. I know this because my father hated her. My father had two children and I feel like we should have gotten the money. She did not tell me or my sibling about the life insurance. In fact after the funeral she told he didn't have any. She said that I would have to pay for the headstone for the grave because of this. Is there anything I can do to get the money back? Can I sue?

"(FL, US) Labor laws questions(2 of them)"	"Hello! Thanks for taking the time to read the following long post and for any advice that you can give. I have reviewed the page's wiki and determined that my question was not answered. I will apologize if I missed it.I am researching the labor laws of Florida based on my mother's situation. She currently works for a company as an hourly wage worker. She typically works more than 40 hours per week and is compensated for the overtime in accordance with the FLSA at 1.5x her hourly rate. However, it has come to my attention that she has worked more than 40 hours in a week, then took some hours of Paid Time Off(PTO) at the end of the week. Rather than take those PTO hours from her accrued bank of hours, they deducted it from her overtime hours worked in that week. My first question is the legality of this. My understanding is that her PTO is paid at straight time and, as previously mentioned, overtime is at 1.5x. The disparity here means she is losing money by trying to take vacation hours in a week that she works more than 40 hours. This has occurred on more than one occasion(she has worked with the company for 4 years).The next question is regarding hourly wage rates and full-time vs part-time positions. As I said, my mother has worked for this company for 4 years in full-time capacity. Recently, they have hired a new employee to do the same job, but part-time. The new employee's hiring rate was $12.00 per hour. My mother, after 4 years, is being paid at $10.50 per hour. The only additional information i have about the other employee is that they are a woman as well, so gender discrimination is not a concern. I am unsure if any other bias can be taken into consideration without speaking with my mom further. So, for this question i'd like to determine the legality of it based on a non-biased position. I would like to state that my mom has brought this up to her manager who stated that ""She gets paid more because she is part-time.""I apologize ahead of time if anything is unclear and i'd be more than happy to provide any amplifying information that is needed. Any details that I do not know I will request from my mother, so replies may be delayed as I get the information needed. Thanks again!"

Auto dealer contacts me every few months after I have told them not to call me again	"Here is a bit of the backstory. I bought a brand new car in 2011. The next day on my drive home from work I noticed a dent in the hood. It looked like a manufacturing defect and I brought it into the dealer within 48hours of purchasing it. The sales man said there was nothing they could do as did the sales manages and service manager. One of the managers actually asked if I had pissed someone off and they hit my hood with a mallet! The damage was minor and looked as if it was done before the vehicle was painted. I left the dealer frustrated and told them I wouldn't do any more business with them again. About 4 years ago I started receiving phone calls from them telling me they would like me to upgrade or they have someone interested in my car and I told them the above story, and that I would never do business with them again. I was always polite but firm and asked them not to call me anymore. But still, every 3-6 months I get a call from them with the same story. Today, I snapped at the poor woman on the phone. She said she is sorry for the service I received and will make sure I don't get called again. But the last 6 people I've talked to have said the same thing. I told her and the last few callers that I feel that I am being harassed by them but don't know if there is actually any legal recourse for me. I'm in Canada."

Memory Question (32 GB of 3200 Mhz or 16 GB of 3600 Mhz for Ryzen 3800X)	"Hi all. A few months ago, I was beginning to buy new parts for the PC I was planning to build, and one of these parts was memory. I was considering to go with Ryzen 3000 (which I did), so I specifically chose the 3200 Mhz C16 option of the Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB 16 GB Kit, since that's what was recommended for Ryzen 2000. Obviously, I should have waited, since my motherboard at the time couldn't even support that speed (MSI B150M Bazooka), and when Ryzen 3000 released, the recommended speed was now 3600 Mhz. So, currently my PC has a Ryzen 7 3800X with the memory I listed above (Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB C16 at 3200 Mhz). So, here's my question.Along with gaming, I use my PC for video editing (and music production, but I don't think that's as memory intensive), and  I eventually want to upgrade to 32 GB of memory. So, should I buy another 16 GB of my current memory, or should I buy a kit of 3600 Mhz memory and then buy another 16 GB kit of it later on? I don't need to have 32 GB immediately. I honestly don't even know when I'm going to actually buy it, I just want to know which one I should choose when the times comes. The kit I'm looking at is the Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 16 GB C18 at 3600 Mhz.Thanks for any help!"	What motherboard do you have now?	doqxyj	pcmasterrace	1	1

The sadness when you no longer meet minimum specs	"Interesting situation for me....I built a PC a long time ago, and it's been great for years. I put a new GPU in a couple of years ago, and I've been running everything I wanted to at resolutions &amp; FPS I've been happy with.I have been considering/looking at an upgrade for a while, but it's one of those ""needs new mb, cpu and ram"" upgrades rather than just a single component.  I haven't been in a position to afford an upgrade, but it hasn't been a problem.Today I was looking at the BFV stuff and saw the minumum specs, and realised for the first time I couldn't make it (cpu-wise), and it was a weird feeling.All the advances in GPU tech over the last 5-10 years have been great and allowed me to keep up (4K aside) and play wonderful games with great visuals.  Upgraded to SSDs a few years ago and that again gave a sweet bump. It's like the human body....you can get a hip replacement, lung transplant, heart transplant, prosthetic limbs, a butt lift, but eventually the brain will simply get too old and you will die.It's easy of course for us to focus on the cutting edge of this lifestyle, with amazing builds and people pushing products beyond what they were originally thought capable of. However for a great majority of us it's about enjoying what we can with what we have - and we've been in a glorious era where SSDs and GPU compatibility has meant we can incrementally upgrade and continue to enjoy amazing games and online experiences with our friends without the stereotype of ""having to buy a whole new system every year"".For me, that time is at an end. I don't know if/when I'll be able to afford an upgrade, and of course it's only a single game impacted at this stage - I still have plenty to enjoy. I just thought it was a timely reminder of how for many of us we've been able to squeeze so much value out of our beloved rigs :)edit: maybe time to add a ""descending peasant"" flair or something :p"	"minimum specs dont really mean anything, what is the cpu?"	9743ih	pcmasterrace	1	1

The 120 FPS Joke isn’t Something we Should Laugh at	"Yes, I know, masterrace and all. Hear me out though. Everyone likes to joke about consoles on this sub, and it’s understandable. Consoles hitting 120 FPS is something we should be encouraging, not mocking. Here’s why. TV manufacturers go with the demand of what the consumer finds popular at the time. Sometimes this is a hit, sometimes it’s a miss. Consoles are something that can easily influence the market because of how common they become in a household. These things sell millions upon millions of units. HDR has been pushed recently and a big reason for it is console marketing. Now can you imagine TV manufacturers focusing on things like display port and Freesync? With consoles marketing these features they will become more common, and cheaper. That’s my take on it. Disagree if you’d like, that’s fine. I just want everyone’s gaming experience to be kick ass... and cheaper. My wallet hates me as it is."

Cheque bounced from wifes inheritance account when there's more than enough money in the account (UK)	"My wife's grandfather passed away and left equal shares of money to all the grandkids and great grandkids etc she hasn't cashed hers in yet, but is hearing that the family members that have had the cheques cashed have had them bounce.Her auntie has control of the account and gave out the cheques so there is no suspicion of foul play at all. There's is money in the account, could it be that there are lots of cheques trying to be processed at the same time? There is literally about 22 (big family) cheques coming out so maybe the bank saw things and put a hold on the account as it looked suspicious?"

Disability for mother with memory problems (US)	"Hi personalfinance, I'm helping a friend find his mother's medical records after she had a brain injury, and we're at a bit of a loss.  Here's the situation: His mother has recently developed brain damage limiting her memory.  Years prior to this, she was in a car accident that prevented her from working (she had foot/knee problems that apparently limited her movement).  We have access to all the records from her most recent trip to the hospital, but she doesn't remember much about her previous injury or the healthcare surrounding that.  In the process of applying for disability, we're being asked for her records surround the foot/knee injury.  We've been looking for a while, but can't find a way to get medical records for an unknown doctor, from a different insurance, from a different state (Alabama, currently in Florida), and from an unknown hospital or office.

Advice - Loan from my 403b	"So I have 3 credit cards that have semi-large outstanding balances, all with an APR over 18%. I recently learned I can take a loan from my 403b at 6.25% interest and pay it back in two years by using contributions to my 403b (I contribute about $230 a pay period, a 2 year pay back would be about $200 per pay period, meaning I'm not taking away from my monthly income).Taking a loan, I could pay off 2 of 3 card balances and then use what I was paying monthly towards my 3 cards and put them all towards the last card balance without affecting my income. Downsides: I'm stalling my retirement contributions for about 2 years. If I leave the company before the loan is paid back, I have 90 days to payback the remainder of the loan balance or I incur some large tax penalties (I feel pretty secure with my job, never had a below average performance review and I have plenty of work to do so I feel pretty safe).This is a no brainier right? Once I finish paying card 3 of 3, I could up my contributions to pay off the loan quicker. Open to any and all advice on the matter!"

Multiple Rewards Credit Cards	"I’m looking for advice on using multiple rewards credit cards. I’m 30 yo, $94k salary, 800 FICO score, no car or student loan debt, and rent in MCOL area. I currently have 2 rewards credit cards - BoA platinum rewards and Chase United Explorer, which I use exclusively. I pay my credit card balance in full every month. Since United’s change in their rewards program, I’ve been considering applying for the AmEx Marriott card because I could get more rewards from that card faster. My question is, how should I balance spend among the three cards? My first thought would be to switch over to exclusively using the new card and leave the other ones stagnant (closing them would decrease my FICO score, right?) unless I’m booking a United flight in which case I would use the Chase card for priority boarding and free checked bags. Would I be able to maximize rewards by doing a balance transfer from AmEx to Chase to BoA and then paying off BoA? I’m not familiar with that process and have read that fees are often imposed to do balance transfer. It also seems like a lot of work, unless I could automate it. Thanks in advance for any advice!"

After landing a job, I bought myself a new car and I have about 24k left to pay off(one of my biggest regrets) with 4.8% APR on a 72 month term.Parents were having financial difficulty, and since my credit was pretty good(750) I got a 10k loan from lending club at a interest rate at 7.97% with 11.49%APR on a 36month term.Lastly, my student loans are roughly 33k consisting of:$5600 with 6.8% interest rate$4600 with 4.66%$6500 with 4.29%$7600 with 3.76%$8400 with 3.4%After paying bills/food I have roughly $1800 to pay toward my loans. I was thinking about skipping saving for an emergency fund and pay off the lending club loan ASAP. I haven't been to the ER since I was 5 years old, rarely get sick and I only go to the doctors for a yearly physical/bloodwork(knocking on every wood I see).I really want to start investing in a roth IRA to start compound interest ASAP. My main question is should I open a roth IRA and invest anywhere between $30-$50 a week in Vanguard index funds or should I pay off all debt first before investing? Or should I start maxing out my roth now since my returns should be higher than what im paying in interest right now.I currently have a 403b plan putting 4% since that is what my company matches.

"Recently paid off a large chunk of debt, curious about what to do now."	"Just submitted my final payment for my graduate student loans - it was my goal to get it paid in full by the end of this year, and I started the year with a bit north of $20k. That was emotional! Curious about insights on what to do with the relative surplus of income I'll have moving forward. The only other debt I have right now is a $20k car loan (got the car in fall 2018 and have been making minimum payments on it, 5.1% APR ). My original goal was to get the car loan paid off by end of next year, but I'm also keen on building up some more liquidity/investments....Info if it helps:1) I have about 4 months of living expenses in cash, most of it in a high yield savings account (1.8% APY) . 2) I max out my Roth IRA every year and also contribute around $6,700ish annually to a couple other smaller investments I have.3) I am renting, and I have no immediate plans to buy a home - but expect within the year to move into my partner's home and would like to do some cosmetic upgrades on the place, ideally, at or less than $5k? 4) I do foresee marriage and children in the near future (1-2 years). My partner has debt (not sure how much is personal and how much is through the family business) and no savings/no retirement funds set aside. This is a bit hard for me to wrap my head around. 5) I have two jobs: I do freelance work in one field and per diem work in another, so my income is steady-ish but not fixed and I usually get slammed in taxes. A few years ago I grossed just over $90k and owed $12k. That was a bullish year for me and this year I'll probably make about 75% of that.As I'm writing this, I realize I should probably spend the next few months hammering down to save up for taxes. But beyond that...should I aggressively pay down the car loan? Build up more cash? Change investment ratio? &amp;#x200B;Any thoughts appreciated. Thanks!"

"The most important line to read on a credit card statement is ""purchases"", I've decided."	"Late last year I added up my credit cards and realized I was over $8K in debt. I knew I hadn't been able to pay off the balances in a while, but every month I'd shrug, try to use the card less, try to do better. When I added them all up I was shocked. I started combing through the statements to see where I was going wrong. Turns out there was a lot I could cut out, so I set myself a goal. I paid as much as I could towards the higher interest one - it earns more cash back, so I was using it the most, then realized that was a terrible idea and cut it up. My one card I'd use for gas/repairs/emergencies I paid to an even balance that I checked every single day so I'd know how much I had SPENT - if I started the month at $5K on it and the balance was $5,700 I instantly knew I'd spent $700 so far.I realize this sounds totally obvious, but at 38 years old I just realized that if my spending is more than what I make, my debt will go in the wrong direction. I know what I earn every month so I easily figured up what that ""spending"" line had to be if I was going to start chipping away at debt.Credit card statements have these huge obvious boxes now about how your minimum payments work, and that's great, but I wish they'd highlight ""hey here's what you SPENT this month!""Today I'm about $4K in debt, a number that still makes me sad but at least I've been moving the right direction."

I have been aggressively trying to pay this debt down, but I see no end and if my calculations serve me correct, I won't be able to pay them down in time that the 0% interest deal cuts off. I am wondering if I should put any of my savings towards paying down this debt, and maybe that way I can start to build up my savings again without worrying about the debt over my head? Do you have any advice on how I can do this? Please let me know if you have any questions, and please go easy on me.... I am still learning about finances. I know it's a sticky situation. Thank you all SO much for the help!!!"	Can you provide more financial insight into your situation?	94xbbf	personalfinance	1	1
To sublease or not?	"I just signed a lease with a couple of friends in Chicago. But I'm going to relocate to Salt Lake City for a job with a nice pay bump, so I need to decide how to get out of my lease.I need your advice in figuring out whether or not to sublet my apartment. Subletting is allowed in the Chicago tenant ordinance, but managing a lease from Utah would be a bit of a pain if the sub-tenant refused to pay rent, caused issues with the roommates, or damaged the apartment. In addition to the headache, all these issues could incur financial costs as well.So my roommates have offered to have me instead pay them 50% of the cost of the rent for the whole year (about 5K) and they will agree to assume liability for the lease. We will of course get this in writing. I get a nice signing bonus with the new job, so I can definitely afford the 5K.So what are your thoughts here? 5K is a lot to pay, but it would certainly offer a lot of peace of mind, and the closure of moving on from the agreement."

Selling/Buying a House	"Reddit, so I just sold my house, and my wife and I are still looking for our new one. We stand to take home $51,500 in net proceeds. I have a car loan that has a payoff of ~$16,400, and a monthly payment of $250. What I am trying to figure out is if I should payoff the car loan, and use the remaining ~$35,000 as my down payment, or if I should just put all of my net proceeds into the new house. With the mortgage/car payment together I am spending $730. Not sure if I provided enough detail, so ask questions as needed, just curious what you guys think I should do.

Starting to panic under contract: Purchasing a home a bad idea for me?	"Ok here goes. I think I know the answer here but:I gross 70k a year.I was splitting rent (~$1400) with my girlfriend but unfortunately we've since broken up. So I've had to consider my next move. I don't want to stay here because well, memories. The market in Salt Lake City is pretty hot so purchase prices are relatively high. Renting is also pretty high and I'm tired of that game. So emotionally, buying sounds nice. I'm currently under contract for a house but I'm starting to panic a bit:-	297k purchase price-	15k down (borrowed, interest free from family)-	3.5% 30 year fixed.-	Seller is paying closing costs up to 5k-	payment works out to be $1543Debts are low-ish:-	$271 car payment-	$56 for iPhone upgrade programAssets are low too:-	$4400 in a traditional IRA that my last employer rolled over from a 401k. Not currently paying into it or any other retirement/401k. My living expenses are high because I’m not frugal and don’t watch my money super closely. (I know, I know) I’m trying to make changes to be more financially responsible going forward regardless of purchasing a home. I have great credit (820+) and always pay my bills. I’m just really good at living at the end of my means. Which I’m tired of.So my questions are these:-	Should I buy a house? I know it’s on the high end as a percentage of income but other expenses are low-ish.-	I work from home. Are there any tax or other benefits that could help me in this regard?-	How bad of an idea is borrowing a down payment?Let me know what other info might be helpful.

Mortgage Mystery	"My husband and I are currently living in my mother-in-law's second house to save up for our own home and become debt-free. We just pay utilities and look after the house while she stays at her other property in another state. She says that she wants to keep this house in the family and sell to us when we're ready... Which would be great, but our combined income at ages 28 and 29 is $125k and this house is now worth about $660k so we'd probably be house-poor for the rest of our lives. There's no way around that without seriously increasing our income, right? Anyway, my real question comes from seeing my mother-in-law's mortgage statement. The house was purchased in 1994 for $169k. The principal remaining on the most recent statement is $144k at 4% and the term is set until 2048. Does this mean she refinanced this year? Does this also mean she is facing significant financial hardship? I don't understand how one can own a house for that long and only effectively have paid $20k on it... I am very scared about purchasing a home and clearly don't know much about mortgages. Can anyone help me understand the situation? If she is facing hardship, we would be willing to pay the mortgage amount ($1300; instead of the $450 we currently pay for utilities) if it meant we could live here longer (super sweet house and a fantastic area and school for our daughter). Does that seem like a mutually beneficial proposal to make? Any advice is appreciated, thanks for reading"	Have you discussed price?	939ft4	personalfinance	0	1
Parents bad mortgage	"So let me start off by saying I know the way this went down was shady and now it’s coming to haunt my family but I’m looking for guidance or resources not criticism. Anyways here’s the details. My parents have never been good with money and never bothered to keep a good credit score(this is in MI btw). So in 2000 they had their friend get a home loan in her name .(once again I know how dumb this is) fast forward to 2010 and my sister took the house and let it get absolutely destroyed by failing to redo the roof. The house needs over $60000 in work, and has a 140000 mortgage against it. Our plan was to surrender the property back to the bank , but it would leave my parents friends retirement fund open for the bank to take. My mother is absolutely losing her mind over the situation and I do not know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time!"

"Laid off, locked into new home build. Looking for advice"	"The wife and I had decided that it was time to move closer to friends and family, so we chose to build a new house instead of buying a pre-existing home.Everything was going fine, we had put our 10% down on the new place, had our current house on the market, the new house had already broken ground, and was under way.  At the beginning of the month, I was laid off.  Since this threw a major wrench into the works, we decided to call off the selling of our house, and try to work with the builder to get out of the new place.  The builder repeatedly told us that they would work with us to get our deposit back in case something happened.  Needless to say, the builder is being less than forthcoming to offer our deposit back.  Since we've already passed the period where we chose material and colors for the house, this, in a way, locks us in.I've offered to take a hit to our 10% down if he'd be willing to just give us the difference for his time and effort.  I'm more than willing to work with them at this point.I've reached out to a local real estate attorney who says that there might be some grounds for an unjust enrichment case, or the builder being in breach of contract for not doing their due diligence in getting the house done in a timely manner.  We are set on staying in our current house, and no longer want to move.  The kids have had too much instability to try and force another move on them.  I guess what I'm asking is if anyone has dealt with this before, or could point me in the right direction, or can give me some advice in how to move forward.  Worst case scenario I could try to get it settled in court, but I would prefer to settle in amicably.Thank you in advance."	Where is the house?	dhxwta	personalfinance	1	1

"I’m not quite sure how to organize my thoughts on this one, I’ll try and number them in order.1. I make $15 an hour to do the job of a general manager in what is a small-medium business 100+ employees and contractors.2. The business experienced a slow period beginning early 2016 and ending mid-late 2017. 3. Sadly, our company’s owner passed away last year, family has taken over and have begun to chase business down, business is now booming for us. We honestly can’t find enough skilled employees to fill our void.... we are actually turning business/contacts down. 4. I want to ask for a raise, but I am afraid to negotiate at this point. I also believe that the job I am doing should pay a minimum of $25 an hour or atleast a 50k salary. 5. I’m currently motivated to either look for a job that pays better or ask for a raise due to being miserable because of another employee that we can’t afford to let go at this point. I am constantly biting my tongue and letting a lot of issues go. The leadership in the company is well aware of the situation and have asked me to be patient and deal with it for the time being.6. If I were to leave the company at this point, it would be extremely hard for them to find someone who could learn a program that I implemented in our company to track finances, inventory, working hours of employees, maintenance on equipment, etc.. I’ve also manipulated the program to create custom reports at the owners request.  No one else in our company is trained to use the program. Do you guys/gals think it would be too soon to negotiate a livable income? I am more motivated than ever at this point because of my unhappiness lately (due to a fellow employee). Should I even mention the fact that I’ve been knowingly putting up with the other employees harrassment/childish games for the past 3 years so that we could attempt to find a replacement or should I just bring up all of the responsibilities I currently have? Should I write a memo or a letter documenting all of my responsibilities? Is it worth approaching the new owners so quickly?

CreditKarma score is significantly different than FICO score	"I am fairly new to credit as I opened my first credit card last August.

After a few google and reddit searches, it appears as if I am not alone as other people have reported similar issues. However, their scores were usually off by 10-50 points, not as big of a deficit as mine.I understand CreditKarma uses the Vantage 3.0 which is a different scoring method than FICO but I am still curious as to the large gap in the scores.

I have about 5k left in student loans and my car recently broke down and it's just not worth fixing. I've been biking to work so I'm not in dire need of a car but it's getting a little hot in Texas. Should I use my saving to just pay off my loans then buy a cheap car? I have about $700 left over after rent and bills."	How much do you want to spend on the new car?	by54qw	personalfinance	1	1
