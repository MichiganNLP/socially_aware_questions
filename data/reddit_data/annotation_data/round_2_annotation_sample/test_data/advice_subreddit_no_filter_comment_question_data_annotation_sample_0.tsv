0	Introvert (17M) wants to make foreign friends	"Hi, I‚Äôm a 17 year old who‚Äôs quite introverted and deals with social anxiety. It really sounds weird but I‚Äôm really interested in people who are raised in different cultures or households than mine. I‚Äôve always wanted to make foreign friends to learn about how they view the world and to enlarge my human knowledge. The main problem is that I have no clue where I can  find/meet these people on the internet. I find it really hard to engage with other people irl and on social media, but I‚Äôm willingly to step out of my comfort zone to seek out for these people.

Now I just feel extremely stupid and not educated at all. I see so many people just pick something up and just go for it but there‚Äôs nothing in my mind that says, you can do this. You can try this out and might like it. I have no interested in ANYTHING.

Now, it's not like I am failing his class, but I don't have an A either, and I am just scared because I feel like the students that a professor wants to work with or even talk about his research would be students that succeed in his class, the top students in the class. I am not one of those, but I am really interested in what he does, and I don't know how to go about this without him thinking I'm a complete idiot haha, the irony of this all is that I spent more time reading articles about what he does, than actually completing classwork..."

She came in town and stayed at my house and we had a nice time.Just before she got in town I got in a major car wreck, have a concussion, and am heavily medicated,We went out to dinner with our family last night, and everyone was having a nice time, though at one point my father let me know I was being too loud (understanding it was due to the medication).My sister offered me a ride home. On the ride, she berated me for my behavior, told me I was totally wrong, and when I asked for a chance to give my perspective she flatly refused. I said I would like to get out of the car, as this does not seem fair to me, and she pulled over and sped off. This was 3 miles from my house, While I am on concussion protocol. While on heavy medication. In the rain. &amp;#x200B;I have let my family know this has happened, and they are currently trying to figure out a solution so that we can both attend Thanksgiving.

26	"Im 30 and thinking about moving out of my parents, need advice."	"So this week i sorta started looking at a apartment at impulse i saw on Facebook, its nothing great but its also not a dump and still not far from work (like 6 miles). I held off for so long because i got comfortable and because i have health issues from when im young that scare me but dont really affect me nowadays as much. (heart defects)I do plumbing and heating for a living and clear about 28k a year. The apartment im looking at is like 425 a month (rural area if your wondering), and my only debt is my truck which i only owe like 6500 on and is paid off over a year ahead right now. I talked with my parents about it and they support the idea but think im being impulsive (which i am). But i feel like if i dont make a move i never will and im sorta self conscious about telling people i live at home yet. My other thing is im suck a introvert and i feel like having my own place might get me out more, i dont have many friends and stick to myself other then work so i feel like im becoming really anti-social and anxious. My question to you guys is do you think im being to rash or quick to jump and do this? Met with the landlords today and they seem nice, and like i said even though its nothing special is a good size for a single person. They already got back to me and said i could have the apartment if i want it. Im stressing out over this more then i should be and keep talking myself out of it in my head but i feel like if i backpedal i will just crawl back into my bubble. Thanks for any help."

27	Best way to evict a roomate that isn't even on the lease	"I moved into this place only just this month. When I arrived I was informed of two things by the current tenants. #1 there are two cats that live in the house and we aren't supposed to have pets. #2 My roommate Lily (fake name)  is not on the lease and is not supposed to be living here. At first I was kind of didn't think about it. However, as the days have gone by I have realised what a terrible set up this is. Lily was allowed to move in by previous roommates who no longer live there. From what I am being told Lily moved in around December and was supposed to move out in April, this never happened. Lily now says they will be gone by July. There are several issue. For whatever reason the previous roommates who allowed this decided since Lily is not on the lease she will pay for the houses wifi as her way to contribute. The wifi is $80 - $100 a month. Those of us that are legally on the lease are paying $500 a month for rent. As mentioned above, there are two cats in this housed. Lily was the one who brought the cats. Lily occupies the most fridge space, the most cupboard space and is the messiest. My main issue is that she is essentially living rent free when she shouldn't be. I want her gone and am tempted to tell the rental company that manages the property I live at but am hesitant as I am not sure what exactly would happen to the rest if us that have signed leases and are legally paying rent. Would we be fined for concealing a roommate? would we be evicted?"

34	"My school nurse lied about my parents agreeing with her regarding my medication for a trip, what can I do"	"I'm a senior in an NC high school and I'm going on a three-day school trip to NYC in a week. I have ADHD and I take Adderall to focus in my classes, but I ONLY take it at school because its side effects mess with me a lot (loss of appetite, dehydration, sweating, and overall lack of enjoyment). My parents understand this and it was pretty much already decided that I wouldn't take it on my NYC trip because I won't need it anyways.When my school's nurse looked through my forms and noticed that there wasn't a form for Adderall, she decided she should call my parents and explain why she thought I should take my Adderall on the trip, implying that if I didn't, I'd ""cause trouble"" and my parents would have to drive from NC to NY to pick me up. My ADHD has never gotten me into trouble.My parents couldn't believe she would actually call us to say that, and stayed firm on the decision not to have me take the Adderall. That was around two weeks ago, and I just found out yesterday that she told the other people in charge of the meds and the trip that she'd talked with my parents and they'd agreed I should take the Adderall on the trip. But when I went home and asked my parents, they said they never agreed with her. But this nurse, who seems to think she knows my symptoms better than my parents and I do, disregarded what my parents said and lied to the other staff about their consent because she felt that she was right in this situation. Now thanks to this nurse, I'm going to be forced to take the medicine that ruins my mood and appetite on this trip even though my parents explicitly said they don't want me to take it.  I tried to explain to the other staff at school that my parents didn't agree with the nurse, but they didn't listen. They were patronizing, handling me as if I was just denying my parents' ""decision.""What do I do about this? is there anything I CAN do?

Ex: he asked me to hang out multiple times, asks me deep questions when we're alone, followed me around at a party, laid his head on my shoulder.He's been super thoughtful and sweet and I wish I could date him but he's REALLY naive and I don't want to take advantage of him. At first he seemed really smooth by asking for my number and asking to hang out but then later he told me the only girlfriend he had he dated for 1 month. Also, he's a devout Catholic so I can't imagine he has much experience on that field. This kid has fallen head over heals for me in like a week but he seems vulnerable and I just don't want him to get hurt. I also want him to explore independence his first semester of college and I think I would be doing him a disservice by setting up a relationship.I really like him and I think he's boyfriend material but it would be too selfish of me to let this continue.

40	I'm 18 and don't know what to with my life.	"I have no friends, no work. I have everything I need from my parents e.g. food, money, clothes etc. My confidence is stupidly low. I get extremely nervous talking to just about anybody. Its weird because i know what i want to say in my head but when it comes out its nothing like how i thought it. My daily routine: I usually eat, play video games, watch YouTube, browse reddit then go to sleep. I just don't know what I'm doing anymore. I feel depressed and cry feeling sorry for myself but I have no motivation to actually do anything about it. I'm not suicidal but there are times when I've thought dying wouldn't be so bad.

I tried sports, I have exercised induced asthma and I suck at running. I played tennis in high school and have been trying to go to the gym since I was 18 but no matter how many times I tried it doesn‚Äôt stick. Ever since I could remember until the end of high school I was really into music, so I tried picking up a few instruments like the piano and guitar. I even took lessons for the piano for about two years. I never progressed past a beginners book and now I can‚Äôt play anything no matter how many times I practiced. I tried art like crocheting and painting but again I just wasn‚Äôt good at it. It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt given these things enough time, because I‚Äôve given them all years, I‚Äôm just not good at anything."	Working with animals in general?	97vjvk	Advice	0	1
43	Flaky Friend. What would you do?	"I have a friend who I‚Äôve known for about 1.5 years now. My husband and I both get along with him super well. We are interested in the same hobbies, shows, music, etc. and generally have a lot of fun together.The problem is that we rarely get to spend time with him because he is a major flake. When we make plans to see him (which we are always the first to initiate conversations or plans), he will only have one day that works for him in the next couple weeks. My husband and I will say something like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre free on Monday, Tuesday, and during the weekend. When are you free?‚Äù He will say something like, ‚ÄúOnly Monday works, maybe.‚Äù In any case, he always seems wishy-washy with setting a date.I have thought, maybe his life is just crazy busy.  My husband and I both work full time jobs. I work about 50 hours a week, so I get that. But we always try to make time for him. He currently only works part time.Once the day rolls around, we will get a text saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be a couple hours late.‚Äù Which eventually turns into canceling at the last minute after we‚Äôve readjusted for two hours. There is never any explanation. Sometimes an apology.  And then the cycle continues. It is literally like this 85% of the time.We have not brought up this issue to him (which I would normally do) because he‚Äôs a very anxious person and sensitive. He tends to shut down when confronted and I don‚Äôt want to chase him away completely (which I realize sounds silly, but we honestly care about him.)In the end, both of us just end up feeling hurt and stepped on. We wonder if he cares about our friendship because he never initiates. We get angry when we plan our lives around seeing him and then he cancels, which inconveniences us, but more importantly, makes us feel like he could care less about us.So I guess my question is: 1) Am I even justified in being upset about this?  2) If you were in my situation, what would you do?"

46	How long should I wait for my landlord to reply to his email?	"I just moved in to a rental apartment a month ago. Something under the kitchen sink is leaking. It only leaks when the faucet is running. At first it was just a small leak. On Tuesday evening I emailed the landlord asking him to come have a look. He emailed back pretty quickly, saying it sounded pretty minor, and he asked that I try to tighten up some of the connections under the sink myself.I was not able to fix the issue, and I know nothing about plumbing so I was actually scared to make the issue worse by tinkering around under the sink. By Wednesday morning (yesterday), the leak had gotten bigger. I've stopped using my kitchen faucet at all - it doesn't leak as long as the faucet is off.I emailed the landlord again yesterday morning saying it's not fixed, and have not heard back from him yet.It's now been about 24 hours since I emailed him. How long should I wait before I contact him again? I don't want to piss him off by being rude or pushy, but I'm also not able to use my kitchen sink right now, which is really annoying.

"I met a girl a while ago who seemed to be pretty normal so when she asked to add me on snapchat I did so without much thought. We started chatting normally but after maybe 3 days (Might have been 2) she started getting really personal and began to give me in depth information about her life that I didn't ask about in any way. She became attached to me really quickly because I'm ""Easy to talk to"" but it's mostly because the majority of my replies are things such as ""Wow.. That sucks... Really?... I can't imagine,"" ect. Most of what she talks about is her severe deppression and anxiety, mental/emotional abuse from her father, severe and daily bullying at school, and her thoughts about ending it all. She says I'm her rock and the only real friend she has, but in all honesty, I don't like her at all. I don't want the burden of being her emotional safe haven or listening to her go on and on and on every day. She lives a few states away from me and doesn't know where I live, go to school, any of my friends, ect. So I could just block her everywhere and that would be the end of it for me. The only reason I haven't done so (and why I'm making this post) is because I'm fairly confident she would go through with it and end it all. I would probably never hear about it and nobody would know my involvement with her but I may be the only thing keeping this person from going through with it.

Me and sister used to be great friends back when we were younger but ever since I went to secondary school, we haven‚Äôt talked. I can‚Äôt remember the last time we had an actual conversation. Actually I don‚Äôt think we have ever had a genuine conversation. I hate the fact that I have no idea how to talk to her let alone what to actually say to her. I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs because she resents me for being a mean big brother or the fact that she genuinely doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. I really wish I knew what to say and how to speak to her. Maybe it‚Äôs just a phase that she‚Äôs going through (I understand teenage girls to a certain degree) but I‚Äôve spoken to my girlfriend about this multiple times but she doesn‚Äôt even know what to tell me anymore. I want a good relationship with her and I hope that maybe it‚Äôs just her going through some angsty teenage phase and she‚Äôll eventually want to talk to me.

In the policy I am allowed 3 unexcused absences and my overall grade in the class drops a full 10% out of 100 every time I miss after that. This isn‚Äôt a problem for me in most classes as I am normally present, but I miss my first class of the day or am late on a semi-often basis. This really isn‚Äôt a problem in one of my classes because my professor doesn‚Äôt really worry about it, but in one of my classes my professor is really ‚Äúby the book‚Äù and has dropped my grade from an 84% to a %64 based solely on missing two days of class over my 3 day limit. Today I was finishing up a project for the class and ran into a printing issue so I was going to be a decent bit late for this class (the class is three hours long by the way, and it is completely unnecessary), and my professor would count me absent if I am too late. So instead I took a doctors note that I obtained from the on campus health center a few weeks ago and used it to digitally forge a new note for today so I wouldn‚Äôt have more points deducted for another absence. I emailed him the doctors note and my excuse for missing class, like I had done with the original note, but this time he asked to me to bring the note to class, along with the original that I had used before. I have already thrown away the original note and the fake doesn‚Äôt really exist, so I‚Äôm SOL for turning in any kind of physical proof.

However that year my dad got transferred to Europe and so I moved with him over the summer. For a little context, this girl was my best friend and we pretty much spent the entire summer together including when she came to my grandparents' house in Florida for our last week together.Before I moved we had talked and I had decided that we should probably break up because long-distance relationship as 15-year-olds, in my opinion, wasn't feasible. She agreed with me but she seemed on the border between wanting a long-distance relationship and breaking up.After I moved we kept in contact as friends and face timed very frequently but we had 'officially' broken up. After the first two months at my new school, I hadn't really transitioned well and was feeling depressed throughout the school day and then I would immediately head home to talk to her. I thought that the reason I wasn't very happy was that I still had a very strong connection to my life in the US through my ex. Around the same time as I started realizing how unhappy I was my ex started dating someone from my old school who I knew.  The combination of her getting a new boyfriend and not being able to move on from my past school life and commit myself to my new social life lead me to decide that I was going to cut off my contact with her, so I talked to her about it and then blocked her.

137	AITA for not wanting to get my hair and nails done for my mom's wedding at a salon and just do it myself?	"So my mom is getting married on V day next week.. she asked me what I was going to do to my hair. I told her I wanted to do it myself and had a certain style in mind. She insisted that I go to the Dominicans and have them wash, blow dry, and straighten it. I wasnt really wanting to do that because my hair is slightly damaged from the micro braids I had in a couple months ago. And I was just trying to stay away from heat for a while. She said she just wants it to ""look nice"" as if I dont know how to do my own hair I guess lol idk. She said it's just for that day and I can wash it and do whatever to it after the wedding and she would pay for it (I'm not working right now so money is tight on my end) but I'm just like I really dont want her to spend her money on something that's only going to be for one day, especially when she has better things to worry about.. then my grandma asks me what i'm doing about my nails. I told her I brought my own nail polish and will do it myself. She then says the same thing my mom said about looking nice and she would pay for them.. I'm just like üò™üôÑ I'm a 21 year old woman, I know how to do things myself without spending money on it if i have the necessary tools to do so which I do.My question is, am I the asshole for feeling this way? I know it's for my mom's wedding but I'm really just not the type of person to go to the salon if I really dont need to. Idk."

138	AITA for giving a girl a toe massage in front of my girlfriend?	"My girlfriend(f25) and I(m22) went to a party last night with some of my friends from high school. It was fun and a quite chill night, but everyone started to get drunk. Two more girls from my high school came a little later and I introduced my girlfriend to them. While my girlfriend, one of the girls and I were chatting the friend hit her toe on the table and I felt bad for her and gave her a awkward little toe massage while I said poor you. The toe massage as I like to call it is nothing sensual, but rather one that your mom would give you if you got a booboo.A little backstory with this female friend of mine. While I exited a relationship 4 years ago I got lonely and planned to hit on this girl, without actually doing it. This was in hindsight because I was lonely and she was avaliable, but I didn't really like her. I told my girlfriend that. At the time of this 5 second long toe massage I didn't think of it in a flirty way as she is a good friend of mine, but my girlfriend exited to the balcony in anger.Girlfriend and I ended up having a fight because she thinks I tried to flirt with female friend in front of her. Her argument is that I wouldn't have done it to any of my male friends, and I do agree that I wouldn't as it would be weird.I think the reason my girlfriend is a bit more vulnerable to my behaviour is because I had a one-night-stand about 5 months into our (back then) long distance relationship, around 2 years ago.AITA for giving a slightly awkward toe massage to a friend of mine?"

The girl and I started talking and eventually set up a movie date over the weekend. Our plans were really last minute and convoluted and she ended up texting me saying she had some things to do but she would try and make time. She didn't get back to me so I assumed she was still going (where I messed up). I texted her ten minutes before the movie was going to start asking where she was. She said she couldn't go.We decided to meet up during lunch break later in the week. I was really excited to actually hang out with her. I texted and asked where we should meet up and she was really confused until I reminded her that we were supposed to hang out. She said she needed to make up some schoolwork so I didn't care too much that she cancelled. Twenty minutes (lunch is an hour) into lunch my friend, the one who set us up, told me the girl was hanging out with her friend. This hurt me.I confronted her about this and she said that she wasn't trying to avoid me or hurt me and that she would tell me if she didn't want to see me.

Her sister, niece, father and I all have birthdays in August within a week of each other so usually one big party is thrown for us and we all open gifts.Now I‚Äôm in a weird spot in my life. I‚Äôll be turning 24 this Friday. I just moved into my first apartment with my boyfriend and am still adjusting to spending this much money on rent/utilities. I‚Äôm paying of A LOT of credit card/student debt that accumulated from a lot of circumstances, but now that I have my first decently paying job, I‚Äôve been making progress paying it off and I‚Äôm really proud of myself. However money is still a little tight for me.Knowing this I asked my stepmom if I could contribute a little bit to a gift for everyone together because I didn‚Äôt feel I could afford to get everyone something. She said not to worry, she would put my name on what she got them and it would be a ‚Äúfamily gift.‚Äù And that was the end of it.I have been saving a little money but after the party I ended up spending a pretty decent chunk of change ($100) on a high end pillow because I have neck/back problems and keep waking up unable to move my neck. I also spend money ($64) on skincare stuff because my skin is really sensitive and I was having a hard time finding cheap stuff that worked for me.I feel really guilty spending the money I saved on myself and not buying birthday presents for my family members. My cousin is planning her wedding in Cancun for next year, which I know is expensive for her and she‚Äôs on a budget and she still bought everyone something. AITA for doing this?

141	WIBTA for ditching a film project that is an absolute train wreck?	"Hi,So a bit of context. I'm a young director (22) who recently was approached by a really talented guy (Cine) to direct a short film. The job was unpaid - I would very rarely take unpaid jobs, however I was interested enough by the script to jump on board and put some of my time into the work.Unfortunately for me, the producer is incredibly difficult to work with. He refuses to do anything - whenever we need to make contacts, or get in contact with anyone, he will tell people he has done it when he simply hasn't. Time was running out in the short pre production schedule, and he still hadn't found a production designer, sorted costumes, props etc or realistically done any of his jobs.Cut to yesterday. I have worked with actors, done shot lists, rewritten the entire script repeatedly refining it and making it understandable, done a variety of storyboards and blocked the entire thing out. That's when I hear that my actors, who were supposed to liason with my producer have literally never even heard of the guy. Massive red flag. And one of the actors said the only thing from the producer they'd been told were the dates - the wrong dates. I was furious. I spoke to him and he full on lied to me saying he did speak to them and he just changed the subject when I provided evidence he hadn't. We have a ¬£50,000 camera on rent directly from Sony, lots of equipment, but nothing else. The only person who hasn't done their job is the producer. Now, I am being asked to fork out ¬£100 to pay for travel to a location I was told would be paid already, and we have literally nothing sorted, no costumes, no power, no props, no extras, nothing. We need these things.Would I be in the wrong to simply say enough is enough and drop out? I'm not being paid and now I'm paying out of my own pocket for this project. I've done all my work and more, but the producer is simply unable to do anything. Now he is refusing to even show up to set."

She was nasty to her old friends and they snapped one day after she purposely hurt one of them thinking she was being funny. She just sat with us one day for lunch and sat silent for about a week. We kind of tried to join her in although not overly tried since she just sat down and didn‚Äôt make any attempt herself. She slowly began to talk to us after a couple weeks but didn‚Äôt really understand half of the things we were talking about since we have barely anything in common. We didn‚Äôt want or need anyone else in our group because it was pretty good and we were just the right number. Once she got more comfortable with us she started being different. She slaps us on the arm hard to get out attention and pushes us around. She said some hurtful things to one of my friends about her dead brother and is kind of bullying a kid with autism (although she didn‚Äôt know he had autism until about 2 weeks ago). She is really quite annoying and doesn‚Äôt seem to understand her place, thinks it‚Äôs okay to be rude to people because ‚Äòwe are her friends‚Äô. She admitted that she used us completely so she didn‚Äôt look lonely the whole time. Does it even count as a friendship if she was using us the whole time? We never really liked her anyway but after she admitted that it just seems like she never actually wanted to be our friend for the sake of being friends but because she didn‚Äôt want to seem lonely.

146	AITA for asking my friend for help?	"Useful background info for this story: friend is half Native American, I'm half Asian. We've been friends since we were 4-5 years old. Earlier this semester, my mom found what seems to be a Native American decorative arrow in a Goodwill. It's framed quite expensively, so she thought it might be worth something if it's legit. After Google failed her, she asked me for help on finding someone to look at the piece and get us in touch with an appraisor if it's legit. I find nothing on the arrow, call some appraisers and they don't know the slightest thing about Native American art and artifacts, and I'm at a loss. This is when I remember that my friend recently interned at a small Native American museum, and might have an idea as to protocol with this thing, or might be able to get in touch with her old boss and see if they know anyone qualified to look at it. So, I text her and ask if she might know where to start with this thing, as I have no idea. I thought this was a perfectly fine thing to do as she had experience in a museum who probably sees stuff like this more often than your average person, but apparently not as she got upset with me for asking her because she's Native. I tried to explain that I didn't ask because of her ethnic background but because of the museum experience but it backfired on me and says that I hurt her even asking in the first place, and trying to justify myself was making it worse. I'm not denying I hurt her feelings, and I did apologize and ask for ways I could have better handeled the situation or worded the question, but was left with a ""whatever."" I hate to say it, but was this an overreaction on her part? It's not like I sent her pictures of it and asked her to identify it or appraise it - I just asked where I might find those leads from the most likely person I know to have them. AITA?"

I was taken by surprise and pity came over me so i agreed. On hindsight i shouldn't have. Ever since then, she had been trying to push more and more of her jobscope to me. It would be fine if it was a once off favor but she is basically trying to offload a few regular processes to me. I am responsible for the results of the team and if she is tardy, we cannot hit our KPI, i'm the one who has to face the music.

149	AITA? Privately let a flat and left it a disgrace	"AITA? So, me and the other half have lived in a family friends flat for 5 years. We moved out yesterday. So we emptied the flat, replaced furniture that had been damaged (cats had plucked couches so bought 2nd hand couches to replace them. They were a better make and quality but they were 2nd hand and slightly worn). Flat wasn't spotless but was clean. I had a call today saying they are so disappointed, they trusted us, they cant believe we have left it in the state that we have done etc etc. Their words: There is some paper under the bed, the table falls apart when you put something on it (we never had a problem) couch is such a mess (we replaced used for used) there is a stain on the carpet, nails still in the wall (that I agree with but I couldn't reach without a ladder and they were re-decorating so didn't think it would be too difficult to take a few tacks out while they were already up there). We have paid them roughly ¬£20k in the time we were there so I think decorating, a new carpet (or a carpet clean) and paying for a deep clean isn't too bad of a deal for them! We replaced the broken washer with a brand new one - now 6 months old, found a new private tenant (saving them thousands in letting fees) and taken items to the tip that they asked us to.

150	WIBTA for asking fellow subway passengers to move so that I can sit down?	"So, I'm 8 and a half months pregnant, and I ride the subway to and from work every day. For my entire pregnancy, the subway has been a particular trigger for me: I get frequent low blood pressure attacks on the subway, including nausea, light headedness, and feelings like I'm going to faint. A couple of times I've needed to crouch near the ground just to keep from keeling over. Luckily, since I've become visibly pregnant, I've had generous subway passengers offer their seats about 80% of the time. Sometimes they don't, and that's fine - that's their choice. But when they won't move out of the brightly colored chairs that are specifically designated for pregnant women, people with disabilities and people with babies,  I do get kind of annoyed - However, I've never demanded that someone move because I am aware that some people have invisible disabilities and I don't want to embarrass anybody or call anybody out publicly.Now that winter has arrived, I'm often wearing bigger coats, which means people cannot tell that I'm pregnant and will rarely give me a seat. This has been especially bad since the 8-month stage, because my constant sick-feeling is being aggravated by my increasing size. I'd like to ask people in the bright-coloured seats to move (there's no way they can ALL have invisible disabilities) but I don't want to be an asshole. What should I do? Additional Info: I take cabs when I'm too sick to ride the subway, but it's too expensive to be an everyday option."

I didn't really feel love. I hadn't addressed the thought until I heard my other sister (not mother of niece) talk about how everytime she sees her, she's filled with a sense of love.Now, she's about a year old, and everyone in my family talks about her so endearingly. I wanna clarify that I don't feel jealous of the attention or anything like that, I just genuinely can't relate to what they say about her. I don't feel any connection to her past the obvious ""Aw cute baby"" feeling. And I can never grasp conversations about her either. Like, I don't understand how they can all talk about her so long because I just get bored immediately. Our family group chat is just full of pictures of her and then people proceeding to send many, _many_ heart emojis, call her cute, etc. It also isn't that I'm trying to act all cOoL and eDgY by not liking a baby, I just sincerely can't relate to how everyone else feels. And I feel really bad about it. I always try to interact with her, but it comes off as awkward and forced, which makes it obvious that I don't really want to be doing it. That, of course, makes my parents quite frustrated, especially when the baby's calling out for specifically me.I really wish I could relate to how my family sees my neice because, well, it feels like when people are referencing a movie you've never watched, and you try to keep being in the conversation with no knowledge of what they're talking about. It also seems as if this feeling is going to keep being there as I become older and reach the age of having children. That's going to be a major cause for me being a black sheep in the family (my family's pretty gossipy and throughout the years, I've heard various comments about other people along the lines of ""I don't understand how they don't want children, seems crazy to me"").

161	AITA for being rude to my mother in law	"I didn‚Äôt really know how to caption this post so sorry if the title isn‚Äôt descriptive.Over Christmas, my husband and I went to my in laws house to celebrate. My newly 18 year old sister in law was there as well. Since turning 18, my sister in law has gotten her nose pierced, a small tattoo and a few ear piercings. Just using her new freedom to her advantage. For Christmas I got her a few cute good quality nose rings from the piercing place I purchase my jewelry from (I also have my nose pierced, as well as my septum and a lip ring) and some tattoo lotion she asked for since her artist recommended a special one because her skin was reacting sensitively to the one she was usingMy mother in law watched her open it and went essentially said‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt like the rings. I think studs are so much classier. I also really hate your tattoo. I think tattoos are ridiculous‚Äù I ignored her and told my sister in law I would take her to the place I went to to change her nose ring, since it‚Äôs easier to get a professional to do it until you are used to changing it. My mother in law said ‚ÄúNo you won‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt like the hoops.‚Äù I told her ‚ÄúWell, she does and it‚Äôs her face. She‚Äôs 18, if she wants to change her piercing, she can.‚Äù And that was the end of that. Later I texted my mother in law about New Years plans and she told me I wasn‚Äôt welcome in her home until I apologized for being so rude and disrespectful towards her. I said I was sorry she felt I was rude if she felt disrespected, I was just defending sister in law and her right to do what she wants, and she blocked my number and told my husband I was the rudest person. My husband thinks I should have just left it alone and taken her to do it without interacting with mother in law, but I felt it was important to show my sister in law she had a supporter and someone who would defend her, but now think I was excessively rude. My sister in law says I wasn‚Äôt, so there‚Äôs mixed feelings.My sister in law doesn‚Äôt live with them, she moved out and lives with a few friends. AITA?"

162	AITA for not scheduling my wedding around my siblings time?	"I am having a wedding soon. Due to both of us being international it was difficult to find a good date for the entire family.Now we have found a date that really suits us and is something we'd like to always have as an anniversary - were very happy with the date and both our families are able to come over - except my sibling.They're currently way out of the country on the other side of the world and are upset that we didn't wait one more month until they're back home and closer - however waiting one more month would have meant my fiancees family would not be able to come over and my fiancee would be neck-deep in her thesis.Now I've proposed to my sibling for them to join us via video-calling but ""it's not the same"" (it isnt, but better than nothing?) and it's not good enough.Mind you if my sibling truly wanted to, they could come over - due to the super long flight they don't want to.AITA for not waiting one extra month to make it possible for my sibling to attend easier?"

164	AITA for expecting my daughter to be the best at something?	"My daughter, let's call her Ellie, is 15. And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. We've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.Aita?"

165	AITA for not wanting to make a big deal out of my grandma's surgery?	"My grandma is only 70 and pretty freakin active and healthy for her age. We are really close, I lived with her for years as an adult.The only thing is she just found out her uterus is all kinds of messed up. Nothing life threatening, it would just be better all around if it came out. So she is scheduled for a hysterectomy today.Meanwhile I just started a new job and have been up early with very little sleep for about a week. On top of that Ive been pretty sick.My mom and a few of her brothers are visiting my grandma this morning at the hospital. My mom expected me to be up and ready by 7am but she never told me that until this morning. She is PISSED. She went on a rant about how selfish and inconsiderate I was and just a bunch of horrible things before hanging up on me.Theres a few reasons I dont think its a big deal...- Hysterectomies are pretty routine. Theyre serious sure but very rarely fatal, and it definitely has a low complication rate for a woman thats already menopausal.- Im still texting and calling her with support daily. I dont really understand why I need to be there in person if shes just gonna be unconscious for hours.- Im ridiculously exhausted. I would probably sleep through everything anyway.- Im sick. Im hesitant to bring that around people at a hospital that might be susceptible to it.I love my grandma and like I said, we are close. Its not like I never see her, because I do frequently.

166	AITA for waiting until I get my bonus in a couple weeks before looking for a new job?	"I work in an industry where I have certain performance goals to hit each year including sales and operational things. I hit all my goals for 2018 and always get glowing reviews, so I know I should max out my bonus when I have my review in a couple of weeks. The reason I am leaving is because there isn't anywhere for me to go at in company currently and I'm ready for the next step in my career. I am planning on waiting until my review and receiving my bonus before I start aggressively pursuing a new job with more career advancement opportunities and hopefully a higher salary. I can't help but feel bad because my company is great and seems to really look out for their employees. It's also not their fault that they can't offer any more advancement at this time, they're just too small and I'm not waiting for someone to retire before I take the next step. The other part of me feels like I earned that bonus due to my performance in 2018. I know when I go, it'll be a pretty big hit to them so am I leaving my company high and dry?"

167	AITA for not wanting my husband to hang a trophy caribou head in our entryway?	"My husband is a lifelong hunter, so are most of the men in his family. I got my own hunting license after we were married a few years, and I‚Äôve gone with him for a few hunting trips. I even ‚Äúharvested‚Äù my own pronghorn antelope two years ago. My husband has been planning a special hunting trip in Alaska with his family for next fall. They‚Äôve been saving up the money for years, and he‚Äôs really excited about it. (I‚Äôm not planning on going with them for this trip. We have a daughter who will be two by next fall, plus I hate the cold.) So here‚Äôs the thing: he already has some trophy ‚Äúmounts‚Äù hanging in our house. I‚Äôm fine with it as long as they‚Äôre not in ‚Äúpublic‚Äù spaces. Our house has two stories, the top floor has the living room kitchen, etc. All of his trophies are downstairs, where we have a tv room, bathroom, and storage room/office for him. All the trophies are downstairs where people don‚Äôt generally go. But when he goes on this special caribou hunt, he wants to have it stuffed, and hang his new prized trophy in our entryway. As in, a dead reindeer will be staring straight at you when we open the door to anyone. Package delivery, friends and neighbors, door-to-door salesmen. And caribou are not SMALL animals. They have the largest antler-to-body ratio of any animal. This thing will be at least five feet tall. Which is why he feels that the entryway is the perfect place for it, it honestly probably wouldn‚Äôt fit in many other places.I have no problem with his passion for hunting, I‚Äôve even joined him for some trips. We‚Äôve compromised on the dead-animals-as-decor issue up until now by hanging them where most people don‚Äôt see them. He can show them off to some friends when he wants to, without having them be the focal point of the main living areas. I feel like it‚Äôs unfair to ask him not to hang it up at all, (it‚Äôs his house too, and this will be a trophy of something he‚Äôs planned for and saved up for for years) but I also don‚Äôt want to greet every single person that comes to our door with a gigantic stuffed dead animal head..."

168	AITA for joke-flirting at a gay bar?	"So my girlfriend's friend and his boyfriend invited us to a gay bar this weekend. The 4 of us spent most of the evening together, but at one point my gf went out with her friends because one of them felt sick. I stayed inside to mind our bags and jackets.This older dude approached me, he was obviously buzzed and he tried to start a conversation. I wasn't interested in talking until I realized he's actually my previous boss' son, which was funny so we started discussing how small the world is and all that. He and his friend then sat down at the nearby table and I let him buy me a drink, since he was buying his friend one too.I told him that I'm straight and here with my gf, but I don't think he believed me because he teased me about coming home with him so he can help me ""relax with a guy"" or something. I wasn't taking him seriously at all, besides he's like a decade older than me even if I wasn't straight and had a gf.However I found it funny that my former boss' 30-something son was hitting on me while my friend was probably throwing up outside the bar. Probably because I was already a little drunk myself and I find everything funnier when drunk.So I entertained him a little but I wasn't serious about it. That is, I asked him about the pool he apparently has at home, and what kind of drinks he has etc. but he thought I was being honest though and that I'd just leave my gf and friends and go home with him? When I rejected him he was pretty pissed off and called me a dick-tease, then left with his friend.When my gf and her friends came back I told them about what happened. My girlfriend found it funny but the guys said I *was* actually being a dick tease and that I shouldn't come on to guys in a gay bar as a joke, because they'll obviously want to take me to bed. But isn't that kind of a ""you asked for it"" situation, except with guys instead of girls?Am I the asshole in your opinion?"	"what do you mean by ""joke flirting""?"	d8l2lq	AmItheAsshole	1	1
169	AITA for wanting to take a break from hanging out with my best friend?	"My best friend started developing feelings for this girl back in March. A few of our friends and I decided that we were going to try to help him get with her. At first he was excited and really wanted to get with her, and I was happy to help him. But for 6 months straight he was constantly talking about her, with no action. Now, I get it, he liked her and he was nervous to talk to her, but for 6 months straight, every topic in a conversation turned into a talk about her, and I couldn't just tell him to not think about her. One of the most frustrating parts was when he kept repeating himself on what he wanted to do, ""I really need to talk to her one on one in person"" etc, but he never followed our advice .Jump ahead to the end of the 6 months and he actually began going out with her. GREAT. I can finally stop talking about how he can get with her. Nope. This was his first relationship (he has also never kissed a girl), and I completely understand why he would be a bit nervous about doing things with her. But being messaged nearly every day hearing about their dates, or how annoyed he was at himself for not going for something, it got to the point where I just ignored his messages for a couple hours because I was sick of talking about it. After 2 months they broke up, and he claims that he is over it, when he clearly isn't. Any time I mention a girl he tries to give me advice like he is some guru, ""Well when I was with my ex"" ""Bro honestly from past experience I know that.."" , but he barely even held her hand after 2 months. He still talks about her to this day and it has gotten to the point that I don't even like hanging out with him anymore, especially when it's just us two, because I know he will just bring her up and I have to say the same routine phrases over and over again, ""No you're not in the wrong"" ""No I understand why you were nervous"" ""Don't be mad at yourself"" etc etc.TL;DRAITA for not wanting to hang out with my friend anymore, because he will just talk about his ex girlfriend, who I had to hear about every day for the past 9 months?"

"This summer I let two friends who were made homeless by their parents (they are both mid twenties like me) move into the 3 bed house I rented after my last housemate moved. They continued to turn it into a party house, lose their jobs and spend all their money on drugs.I was sick of paying for them and their dog to live and sick of my home being full of drugged up strangers. I moved into my friends house and let them keep the house in my name with my deposit with the landlords permission so they weren't homeless. All I asked was them to pay the money they owed me after I was lending them money constantly. I ended up in a motorbike accident a week after moving and am unable to work. I am also a full time student. My savings were blown moving and looking after them and being unable to work has left me a bit broke.For the past few months every week they have given me more excuses and not paid me a penny, but have been able to buy drugs and alcohol and don't care a bit that I'm struggling. My parents have been helping me but they don't have a lot of money. I want to take the furniture I left them (sofas TV fridge freezer washing machine ect) and tell them I am selling them. I don't think I will sell them but I don't think they deserve my things any more. They will go into storage in my parents garage most likely. They have just started new jobs and said it will be weeks before they give me any money.It's just before Christmas and I feel bad leaving them with nothing but I feel like I am being taken advantage of here.

My dad and I got to our hotel and decided to go out for food. We found a Chinese place to eat and walked there.When we got there, we were very disappointed. The restaurant (which was very small, which is fine) served us food in those white styrofoam boxes. When we got the food, mine was fine, but my dad was angry. I forgot what he ordered exactly, but he did not get what he wanted. He ordered some meat (pork or chicken or something) that was supposed to be cooked twice, but was cooked only once. However, he didn‚Äôt complain and just ate it.When we left, I asked him why he didn‚Äôt ask them to cook it again. He said he didn‚Äôt want to be an asshole. His reasoning was that they were about to close (we come at like 8:50 and they closed at 9:30) and that they just did a bad job to get us out faster. He also said that cooking it twice takes a lot of time.That made no sense to me. We still paid the full price for food we did not get and they never even mentioned their laziness to us.

I have pretty bad driving anxiety as is, and I just really hate the location and trying to find parking down there.  I wish I could find a salon maybe closer and in a less cramped location. I know that this is a professional service that I am paying for, and we aren't really friends beyond chatting while I'm there an occasionally liking each others instagram posts but I would feel guilty if I just ghosted.

Then she said: "" Well, then stop complaining to me."" I got angry, and went into my room, to calm down. A few minutes later she barged into my room, demanding to know what was up with me. I kept telling her that I didn't want to talk about it. Then finally she pushed me to tell her. I only gave in, because I feared that she'd take my phone or something else away. After I finally told her what was up with me, she said that I couldn't always keep my feelings bottled up inside me, and that I needed to talk to my friend about it. She's right about that, but- You should've heard the tone of  voice she said it in. Its that tone of voice parents always complain about, when their kids use it. Also, my friend is one of these people that hates confrontations, and always says what the other person wants to hear, so it wouldn't help anyway.Now my Mom is angry at me, and refuses to drive me to my friends birthday party. I already made arrangements with my best friend. I'm having her Mom pick me up. Haven't told my Mom about that.

184	AITA for asking my wife to refrain from further drinking when alone with our 3yo son	"We‚Äôre on a family holiday and it‚Äôs all inclusive. It‚Äôs 9pm and our 1yo is on her last legs and I suggest taking her back to the apartment. My wife agrees, she is going to hang out for another hour at the bar before the entertainment starts that our 3yo has been excited about. Sure, I say.My wife can handle her drink and I trust her fully with our kids but at this stage she‚Äôs on Prosecco number 8 (I‚Äôm guessing, her glass was being topped up by waiters throughout the evening). I do know when she‚Äôs getting drunk however, so I asked her to take it easy if I was going to head back without her. Obviously this went down like a lead balloon and she took it as me trying to bring her down. That was not the intention, I wanted to ensure she was fit to manage a (likely) very tired and crabby 3yo or (just as likely) hyperactive one.As it stands I‚Äôm anxiously waiting for them to come back but as bad as it feels, I‚Äôd hope she‚Äôd have the same concerns if the situation was reversed."

185	AITA for wanting to go to a concert with another girl?	"First ever post on Reddit in my 2+ years of lurking so forgive me if my formatting or anything else is not correct. For context im a 24 year old guy and my girlfriend is the same age. So last Saturday I went out with a couple of friends whilst my girlfriend stayed at home, one friend was there that I haven't seen in a while but have been friends with for over 8 years. The friend is a girl.The night goes on and she eventually tells me she has a spare ticket to a concert on the following Thursday and she's upset because the person she was supposed to be going with won't be going with her anymore. It's for a band that I used to enjoy when I was younger so I checked my schedule and I was free that evening and said I would go with her so she wouldn't have to go alone. Obviously she's very happy as she thought she was going to be going alone and I'm happy because I get to see an old band that I used to like and get to spend the night with an old friend.My girlfriend on the other hand is not happy. At all. She is saying that I'm not allowed to go with her because ""just you and her going to a concert is basically a date."" For the sake of honesty and to get an unbiased opinion it is worth noting that when me and this friend were 16/17 we shared a drunk kiss - which my girlfriend knows about. But in the 7 years after nothing of a romantic nature has happened between us.  I can't understand my girlfriends reasoning because in my head I know how platonic our friendship is and it is the furthest thing from a date that I can imagine, it's just two friends enjoying a concert together. I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 3 years, living together for just over 1. We've been arguing about it for the past few days, the concert is tomorrow and we can't come to any kind of agreement, she flat out refuses to listen to my reasoning and is telling me I can't go. So, AITA in this situation? what do you guys think??"	Ask yourself: is a single concert ticket worth the fights and risk of losing your relationship?	9wzlmd	AmItheAsshole	1	0
186	WIBTA if I don't invite my Friend's fiance to her birthday party	"My best friend is dating this guy for a year, they started dated few weeks after her birthday last week and got engaged last month (after 1 months of dating).  My best friend makes every one's birthday especial. She is very caring and puts in all lot of effort. For his birthday she took him to a very nice restaurant, got him lots of gifts (normal couple stuff). She is turning 25 next week and her fiance basically told her that he isn't doing anything for her birthday, she isn't a child anymore and should grow up. I texted him before this asking about his plans for her birthday. Usually I plan her birthdays but since it was her first birthday with her fiance I thought he would like to do something special. Anyway he didn't reply initially and then showed no interest. He then called my friend and screamed at her. She is heartbroken. I promised her that she will have a lovely birthday. Now I am going to plan her birthday and make sure she have an amazing day. Would I be the asshole if I don't invite her fiance.

187	AITA for taking my time on moving out?	To keep a long story short I am a 26M with a pretty decent income. I currently live at home and pay a small amount of rent to my parents. I also help my dad out with chores since he isn‚Äôt in the best medical shape and help my mom shop and do chores around the house. My mom actually appreciates me being around since she is almost 70 now and can‚Äôt do everything like she used to. My 26F girlfriend also lives at home and hates it. She‚Äôs been wanting to move into an apartment with me and while I‚Äôm totally for it I want to find the right place. We took a tour of one place last weekend and while it was okay it was honestly too small and the rent was reasonable but I have seen lower. I told her that I want to find somewhere but it might take awhile for the right place to pop up. She seemed upset but said that was ok. I told my friend about this and he said I was being too picky and was being an asshole since she hates living at home and since I can easily afford to move out I should do it since I‚Äôm too old to be living at home. AITA?	Do you REALLY want to move out or are you just saying that to appease her?	cqcwx7	AmItheAsshole	1	1
188	AITA for locking the door to the room while my roommate was in the shower?	"My roommate and I share one dorm room. She has a bad habit where, sometimes, she‚Äôll leave to take a shower and not take her key or cell phone with her. Usually it‚Äôs not a problem because I‚Äôm in the room. However, I do have a really ingrained habit of taking my key out and locking the door, so if I‚Äôm not in the room and she‚Äôs not in the room, I will do it without thinking about it. A couple of weeks ago she went to go take a shower in the morning, while I was asleep. I got up, got ready to leave, and locked the door on the way out. Fortunately I was just going to grab something for breakfast so she was only stuck outside the room in her towel for a few minutes.Yesterday, same situation. Woke up, she was gone. I was running really late so I rushed my routine and locked the door on the way out. When I got back after class, she was wearing the clothes of another girl in the dorm and PISSED. She asked why I didn‚Äôt look for her to see if she was in the showers when I saw she was gone and the door wasn‚Äôt bolted. I said I didn‚Äôt really think about it and asked why she didn‚Äôt call me. She doesn‚Äôt know my number by heart and couldn‚Äôt find anyone with it. One of her friends was there and remarked as though he was trying to be a peacekeeper that I REALLY should have checked to see if her towel was gone after the first time she got locked out and, if it was gone, gone to the showers and called around looking for her. I thought this was a little ridiculous and said so in a joking tone, but nobody was laughing. Now I have a bunch of people pissed at me because she‚Äôs more popular than me in the dorm.I wasn‚Äôt trying to teach her a lesson or anything, I honestly didn‚Äôt even think about it. However, thinking on it now, I don‚Äôt really get why it‚Äôs on me to always keep track of whether she‚Äôs showering to see if I should lock the door, when it would be so easy for her to take her key.AITA?"

But she uses it while we are watching Alabama play, and she has a good 7 second head start to hear the announcers before we do. And every time we get a pick or a touchdown or something, she yells ‚ÄúWoohoo!‚Äù Before we can see the play even start. I can handle it when we‚Äôre not playing anyone good, but it‚Äôs kinda annoying when we play auburn or Clemson or any rival team. I love her to death and I would feel bad if I told her to stop, but none of us have the heart to tell her we don‚Äôt like it. Should I tell her to stop?

We play at school sporting events early on in the year, so I usually prepare a selection of more popular music.One of the songs I wanted to play was an arrangement of a popular rap song. The score is all instrumental, no lyrics, but the original song mentions the N-word (no hard r) a few times. Since we were just playing the tune, I didn't think that was a problem.I gave my students the piece and the school received a complaint a few days later. Admin asked me to remove the piece from my selection, and that was that. I really don't feel like it was unreasonable for me to ask the band to play it, though.If it matters, I'm half white, half asian. AITA here?"

191	WIBTA for not telling allowing our third roommate to sublease?	"I‚Äôm living with two other people, after a falling out last year the third person said she wouldn‚Äôt be living with us because of myself and the other person. She would continue to pay her 12 month lease but wouldn‚Äôt be living with us. My friend and I were completely shocked by this. We felt everything was going great between us. The only thing we really did *against* her was last year we refused to participate/share harder drugs with her. She‚Äôs 90 pounds and couldn‚Äôt handle even basic things, weed. We told her that we didn‚Äôt support her cigarette habit she just picked up and we were worried for her. We tried talking to her only to be ignored. This was one of our best friends that pretty much threw us aside for god knows what reason. Well, after reading through our already signed 12 month lease, I noticed the sublet section of contract says ‚Äúno sublease will be permitted unless agreed by **all** tenants.‚Äù She hasn‚Äôt even offered a person, but would t be an asshole move to just deny anyone she might recommend, if she ever decides to? So some reasoning/justification: 1. my other roommate was recently raped and living with strangers is a no-no for her. It‚Äôs not as simple as just interviewing a few people and finding someone she is comfortable with either. 2. We agreed to a three person house because we were under the impression all three of us would be living there, not two and a stranger. If my other roommate and I wanted a two person house, we would have signed a lease for one."

192	AITA for telling my sister to shut up?	"My little sister (11y/o) is annoying. She always interrupts people in all kinds of converstations, only to give her irrelevant opinion on the topic. Not only that but she talks so much that sometimes i am getting headaches just from listening to her voice for hours everyday. I hate eating dinner with my family or watching a movie when she's also there. The things she talks about are also really stupid and i couldn't give less f*cks about the drama going on in her class or what her favourite k-pop singer did yesterday morning. I tried to explain to her why it's rude to talk over everyone and force her stories upon people but she doesn't care. In case no one is paying attention to her, she repeats the story a couple of times until she makes sure everyone has heard it.   When i tell her to shut up because she's being annoying and obnoxious she doesn't care and just continues talking and talking and talking. My parents tell me that I am being a jerk for telling her to shut up and for saying that literally no one f*cking cares. According to them i only say it because i have something against her and that i want her to feel bad about herself. Am i the asshole for telling her that i'd like some silence and that she should just keep her mouth shut for once? I am M/19 if that makes some sort of difference."

193	AITA If I Lie To My Mom About My Major In College?	"Ever since I was 18 months old I‚Äôve been a dancer. I was put in all sorts of classes, ballet, tap, contemporary etc by my mother, who was also a dancer but dropped out because of a shattered kneecap she endured in a car accident. Since I‚Äôm her only daughter, my mother decided to force me into her dancer dreams and basically live through me. I missed much school for out of state dance competitions and abroad summer boarding schools, I even did online school for middle school and my first three years of high school online because of the competitions and programs I was enrolled in. Dance is all I know and I love the sport with everything within me as I dedicated my entire life to it, but it‚Äôs not my passion in life. I‚Äôve always wanted to become a lawyer. My uncle is a lawyer and everything about the lawyer life style is what I‚Äôm interested in becoming. My mother? Can‚Äôt hear it. She‚Äôs helped me apply to many dance universities around the world and I even got accepted into a few extremely exclusive schools, but all I want to do is study criminal justice and become a lawyer. By the grace of god I got my mother to allow me to return to a performing arts school for my senior year of high school which I‚Äôm currently starting in the fall and I want to speak to my counselor about going to a college within criminal justice.

Anyways Liam has been seriously on and off for the past month.

We want him around, he‚Äôs fun to be with, and we all just don‚Äôt vibe the way we do when he‚Äôs around. I‚Äôve tried to find out what the problem is if there is any, and I can‚Äôt seem to see anything out of the ordinary out of his own life, so from what I can tell he‚Äôs just drifting away.If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs not my position to stop him. But I wanted to make it known that if he doesn‚Äôt invest more time into our group of friends, there might soon come a time where he‚Äôs not considered in the group anymore. And I really hated saying that to him because it sounds so accusatory, as if he has some responsibility or something. Like, it‚Äôs arduous where it‚Äôs supposed to be fun. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being fair or not in doing this.TLDR: Friend appeared to be drifting away, so I presented him with the ultimatum that either he invests more time in our friends group or he might not even be in the group anymore soon."

I started planning a trip next month for two and a half weeks back to my hometown to see all my friends and family and I wasn't sure wether I wanted him to come or not. On one hand, I'd miss him a lot and want him to see my friends and family and on the other I want a trip by myself as I've been feeling overwhelmed lately and just want some alone time with friends and family. I expressed my feelings to him and was very open about how I felt about him coming and I asked for his input and if I was being selfish etc. He said I can do what I want and he's just happy for me that i'm finally able to go back home. But he also is telling me he wants to come and visit everyone and now I don't know what to do.  I wanted some alone time away from him because I feel overwhelmed and sometimes smothered. He's a great guy and is encouraging me to make new friends here and get out more, but it's been difficult for me to start from scratch especially since I've never lived anywhere else in my life. There's nothing I would do back home that I wouldn't also do with him and I have nothing to hide from him, but lately I just want some time apart with my friends and family just one on one.

I've never expressed any interest in having kids, and I'm genuinely settled on never having any.I recently got a sperm count done because I was considering donating sperm. My mom has expressed that she would want to be informed if I ever did a sperm donation, and I was about to call her and talk about it when my count came back. I'd expected to be okay, it's not like sterility runs in my family (ha), but instead I'm totally dry. Not a single sperm cell. I was a little concerned because I was hoping for that money, but that's obviously not the end of the world. I did go through a period of worry, anger and sadness, because it did make me feel like... less than a full man. I've dealt with those feelings, but now, it's something I just... don't want to tell my mom about. I never planned on having kids anyway, so it doesn't really change anything, and it's not like I was about to accidentally get someone pregnant either. I mentioned my intention to not say anything in passing to my roommate, whose been a help to me as he is actually also sterile. He argued, mostly for the sake of argument, rather than actually fully believing his argument, that by not telling my mom that I actually cannot have kids, I'm lying by ommission, and also possibly setting my younger brother up for a nasty surprise if it is in some way a genetic thing.

271	Bamboo growing onto my property (AL)	We live in 3+ acres in Alabama and one of our neighbors is a vacant plot.  The previous owners of the property planted bamboo near our shared property line and it is now growing on our property.  Our biggest fear is the bamboo will damage our pool area but also it takes a lot of care to continually remove the bamboo from our property.  Installing a containment system appears to cost somewhere in the $1-5k range (depending on the effectiveness).  The bamboo stalks on their property are over 15 ft tall and it is growing at a rapid rate (currently taking up maybe 1/8th acre).

272	Brother killed in crash after being followed by police from bar	"My brother (24) died today in Louisiana 3 days after being followed from a bar and wrecking in a, thankfully, single car accident. The story from the police is that a call was made from the bar saying he was rowdy, and somehow the next thing is my brother is leaving the bar and an officer is approaching him with lights and sirens. Officer says he followed him from the bar, and when my brother began speeding and driving erratically in response to being followed with lights and sirens he backed off. He says he rounded a corner and my brother had wrecked at high speed. This was fairly brief as the bar is pretty close to the crash site.¬†Witnesses heard sirens up until the crash, no backing off. Home security camera on block before wreck shows cop still chasing with lights. They took a significant time to get to him after the crash as they waited for a total of 9 cars to surround him. He was essentially dead when they got to him. He never responded and was brain dead on arrival.We're just trying to piece the story together because no one called us, not even the police.¬†ER workers eventually called us. 1. No charges were made that we're aware of. Is that weird?¬†2. I know entrapment isn't allowed, but are police allowed to follow someone from the bar if the bar called the police to say they were being rowdy?¬†3. He said he backed off when he realized my brother was driving like crazy due to being chased.

273	Got in an accident immediately after purchasing insurance. Need advice	"I just purchased comprehensive auto insurance online for a relatively new, previously uninsured vehicle. The insurance was purchased at 8:30 pm on August 30th. I got in an accident at around midnight  that same evening. Unbelievable, I know, but the information is all time stamped (credit card, emails, etc.). As I began exchange information at the accident I was concerned to realize that the effective date at the bottom of my card was September 1st. I thought the insurance was active upon purchase, though I may have simply made an error or misunderstood when I finalized the purchase. I wouldn‚Äôt have been driving had I known my insurance wouldn‚Äôt be active for another 24-30 hrs.The accident was largely mutual cause, it was pouring rain, and we didn‚Äôt see each other. Cop that showed up hardly did anything so that wasn‚Äôt helpful. Anyway, what I‚Äôm wondering is if there‚Äôs any chance USAA will be understanding or if they‚Äôll stiff arm me, and I‚Äôll lose $10,000 on my car, or worse, be sued or have my license suspended or something.

"Hey legaladvice, I wrote [this formal demand](https://imgur.com/gallery/FBeFIxj) for my mother-in-law. Basically, what has been going on is her and her brother both live in MA and are are the two appointed co-trustees for their late father‚Äôs family trust that he set up. The trust consists of a lake house in Maine and an account that started at ~$115K in 2002 and now has ~$90K. The way the trust is written, both co-trustees need to agree to any expenses or changes, but her brother has been acting without regard to her or their late father‚Äôs wishes. First, he lost about $15K in bad investments that she never consented to back in 2005-2007. Last year he sent out letters asking for advice to supplement the trust fund, then 2 weeks later sent out letters saying he‚Äôd come to the conclusion that everybody would need to pay $500 per week to stay there (except him or his daughter because of ‚Äúall they do‚Äù of course lmao). Well MIL promptly called him and said that no, nobody in the family will be charged a fee to use the family vacation house, the funds in the account are sufficient for the time being, and they‚Äôll discuss a plan of action if and when it becomes necessary. He grumbled and said OK. Now my wife and I scheduled 3 separate weeks there this summer months ago, the first of which begins this Sat 6/1/19. On this last Friday we got a knock on the door with a certified letter from him. It said he had changed the locks and nobody was allowed there unless we paid $1500 for last summer and $1500 up front for this summer. We think he did this very intentionally as Monday was a holiday and we‚Äôd have no way to figure anything out in 4 short days. I drafted this [this ‚Äúformal demand‚Äù](https://imgur.com/gallery/FBeFIxj) for my MIL and we intend to mail it out with new keys to everyone authorized to use the house, go there anyway, and change the locks back to a shared key. My question is, will bringing this document in addition to copies of the will, the trust agreement, and a signed and notarized letter from MIL that we are allowed to be there protect us in the **VERY LIKELY** event he shows up or sends his daughter and tries to have us removed/arrested for trespassing?"

275	Potential illegal kickback	"Edit: This is in PennsylvaniaTo make a long story short, I've recently been hired as a business manager for a Pharmacy.  Since accepting the position, I've learned of the owner discounting a copay on a regular basis for at least one patient since 2016.There are records of a discounted sale on the copay, and also of a gift certificate being created for the customer without being paid for as they stand at the register, and given to the customer to use towards the prescription.The reason for the discounting, as is written in the patients notes, is that the pharmacy gets reimbursed more for the generic of the prescription than the brand. However, the generic is more expensive for the patient than the brand, so the copay is being worked in a way to make it so the patient isn't paying anymore than they normally would. I did some digging online and, by my understandi g, found that adjustment or waiving of a copay on a regular basis is considered an illegal kickback by the OIG.I'm not sure if this has been done with any other patients, as I'm still new to the company, but I was curious as to whether or not this should be something I consider becoming a whistleblower for.Any help is appreciated!"

277	[MA] Ambiguous Compensation Wording in Internship Agreement	"I am a college student interning at a small startup (&lt; 20 people) in the Boston area this summer. In May, I signed an agreement with the dates of the internship, some of the responsibilities, and the compensation details. Specifically, there was a paragraph that read: ""If you accept this offer, you will begin your internship with the Company on \[start date\], which is expected to end on \[end date\]. You will also receive a salary of $\[XYZ\].""Now, I was quite pleased with $\[XYZ\] as it was quite generous and some of the friends I showed the contract to agreed. As such, I didn't bother to negotiate. Two days ago, I received my first pay check and it was apparent that there was a misunderstanding. I got paid about 1/5th of what I expected, and when I did the math, it was clear that they extrapolated my pay to an annual salary--that is, I would receive 10/52 \* $\[XYZ\] for my 10-week internship. And while this new amount is above minimum wage, it's not at all competitive given the field and location, so am considering bringing up the misunderstanding and trying to renegotiate.  Do I have any sort of legal leverage to renegotiate my salary given the ambiguity of wording and misunderstanding? Is there any world where I am entitled to the full amount, $\[XYZ\]?"

I have outlets that don't work, weak floors in a couple of places, and recently discovered that there is a major rodent problem that has LITERALLY led to rats FALLING OUT OF MY WALL from holes left open around the fuse box.  There are exposed wires and holes in the wall.  On top of everything else, I found out that before I moved in HE KNEW about the rats (that are coming from a burnt out property directly next door that he owns).  This is a trailer park, I expected the roaches that were there when I moved in, but I draw the line at rats, when I moved in I had ZERO infestations in my stuff, so nothing came from me, but I was on a deadline and it was a case of desperation to find a place.  I had my health insurance draw from my account, went ahead, paid my other bills and planned to pay on my next check, which they were informed of.  Two days later (unbeknownst to me) I was served an eviction.  It wasn't on my door, and not handed to any adult in my house.

289	[TX] Dry Cleaners destroyed two expensive sweaters and refuse to reimburse me for the full value of them. I want to sue in small claims court.	"Among several other items, I dropped off two wool sweaters to my dry cleaner last week and picked them up Friday. I just noticed yesterday that they obviously washed the wool sweaters, rather than dry cleaning them. For those that don't know, washing wool makes it shrink *significantly* -- to the point that I can't even fit them both anymore. They're useless to me, which is quite unfortunate because I spent ~$100 each for them. I don't make very much money, so this is not at all a trivial amount to me. I know $200 may seem like pocket change to some, but it's a significant amount to me. There is no question that they were supposed to be dry cleaned and not washed, and this was not a case of miscommunication. The reason I know this for a fact is because this cleaners has a special on shirts, where if you drop off at least $10 worth of dry cleaning, they knock 50 cents off each shirt. I almost always do this promo and it's worked perfectly for me for over a year now. It is very specifically dry cleaning, because even if I dropped off 30 shirts, that wouldn't qualify for the promo, as shirts are laundered and not dry cleaned. There is a very big distinction between the two, and they clearly are at fault without question.  I called the cleaners this morning and they are refusing to reimburse me for the value of the sweaters (which were in flawless condition). I want to take them to small claims court and sue for the value of the sweaters and all court/legal costs. Do I have a viable case? I do not have proof of purchase of these sweaters, as I purchased them several months ago and have since discarded the receipt. Is this an issue? Are there other obstacles that will prevent me from having a good case against them? I don't view this as a frivolous case and I certainly am not trying to blow this out of proportion. I just want to be able to buy the sweaters again, and it shouldn't be at my expense because of their negligence. What's my best course of action?"

290	Just Given Notice to Vacate	"Hi, I've been renting a house in Western NY for the past two years and at the end of the summer the landlord put the house up for sale.  In September they transitioned me to month-to-month lease.  This past week I was notified that the house was sold and new owner moving in upstairs.  Yesterday, 10/30/18, I was given a ""30 day notice to quit/vacate"".  It states,""Please take notice, that pursuant to your lease dated prior to current ownership your tenancy located at 3.....NY will not be renewed and is hereby terminated effective immediately, said date being at least thirty days from the date of service upon you.""  I've been given until November 30th to vacate.  Now, the landlord is requesting last months rent.  As I see it, my lease with the previous owner was terminated from this notice before the end of the month, and seeing as I have not signed any new lease with the new owner for the month of November, I am under no obligation to pay him.

Uber came as I was being arrested and they could have mentioned it in the report. No clue on the tow truck. I was booked and released later on $2500 bail for misdemeanor DUI.

We have toured the neighboring apartment, and then rented the one next door once it became available. Not only did we find an old pair of contact lenses on the bedroom floor, but half a Trojan condom wrapper in the corner and a sock in the heater. Neither of the two windows open, despite the landlord promising we could easily install an AC unit. The carpet is very dirty, it strongly smells of cat piss (we believe it‚Äôs coming from the vents), and around the base of each wall is grime. There are thumbtacks still in the walls and scattered in the cabinets. There are dead bugs and occupied spider webs on the kitchen floor. Cat hair is piled into each corner of the room. In the fridge, several dark, easily removable stains are present, as well as a few strands of hair (???). I took pictures of everything we found, to be safe. Is there some course of action we can take to either lower the rent or at least get the landlord to do something about the scent?

208	How to file Adverse Possession in MO	"Sorry for long.So in 2008 I lost my job lost my apartment and quickly lost my savings. After a couple months living in my car I decided the summer heat was too much and started sleeping/hanging out in one of the many many abandoned houses in my city. I've been here since and while I always heard others talk about squatters rights I never looked into it until recently and found out in MO that it only takes 10 years. I hit that mark in about 2 months assuming the cops don't kick me out before then and was wondering about how to file a claim for the title, as I've come to view this place as home. Plus its saved me a lot of money living here that I've been able to pay off all my collections, medical bills and other loans which I never thought I could do. I tried googling laws, but I can barely understand half the words they use on Nolo and Findlaw etc. Would I qualify for adverse possession? The law says 10 years ""open possession"". The first 6-9 months I stayed stealth, only went in and out the back door, parked my car down the street, never had any light sources at night etc. But since then I've acted like it was mine. I mow the lawn, replaced appliances and stuff inside, built a new staircase to the front door, go to neighborhood barbecues and park in the driveway. I never hooked up utilities as I didn't want to flag the possible owners or authorities, but otherwise it should be obvious someone is living there.How do I prove how long I've been there? I have photos of myself and friends hanging out in the yard or in the house from years ago, is that proof enough? Am I opening myself up to criminal charges? I've changed locks, torn out old broken appliances, forged documents so I could get mail there etc. I don't want to risk getting arrested and losing my job and having to start over again.How expensive or lengthy of a process would it actually be? The house was probably only worth 10k or 20k when I moved in and even with the work I've done can't be worth more than 40k now based on looking at Zillow. Would the corporation that owns it bother fighting for such a cheap piece of property?Thanks all."	Have you looked at property tax records to determine who does own the house?	8gr6lh	legaladvice	1	1

214	(TX) Child Custody and Father	"Throwaway for reasons. Basically, my (soon to be) ex husband and I had an open relationship and I had a reliable ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù while my husband had various ‚Äúgirlfriends‚Äù. At one point he made me choose between him and my boyfriend and I chose the boyfriend because he treated me better, treated our four kids better, and was actually responsible. Once I made my choice my ex moved out of state with one of his girlfriends and started sending $20/week for child support. Fast forward a few months, I have a new home with my now fianc√© and the children and he has now moved back, now he‚Äôs living with/open relationship with a stripper who happens to be a Satanist. He only wants to see the children when his mother visits and he doesn‚Äôt send child support at all. His living conditions make me want to vomit (very unclean and he doesn‚Äôt have a bed for the children). I have videos of him PLAYING with knives in front of our youngest, he started smoking weed again (not bad but our children have said he smells ‚Äúfunny‚Äù and ‚Äúsmokes smelly things,‚Äù he claims he has a demon inside of him, and I have a lot of evidence of him being unfit in general. Whenever the kids visit him, they come back unruly and won‚Äôt listen to my fianc√© at all, and our oldest is especially a handful, as she was the closest to her father. With him not having safe conditions, his girlfriend being what she is, not helping with any support at all (he claims my fianc√© should pay because he is a manager at Walmart) and his claim to have a demon in him, would I be accused of alienation if I don‚Äôt allow him to have visitation until the court decides themselves? Also what else can I do? I document everything he says, including the times he‚Äôs asked to see the kids and just doesn‚Äôt show up (or if he does). I would like to know just what I can do to keep my children safe, and is there a possibility to get his rights terminated or get him a psychiatric evaluation? I believe he is a danger to the children but I don‚Äôt want to lose them because I didn‚Äôt allow visitation. He claims he wants to get full custody, but is that at all possible for him to get?"

217	Sewage backing up in my Apartment.	"This is in the US in Iowa. This problem started 6 months ago. The first incident happened while I was asleep. At about 10 pm I was awoken by a smell coming from my apartment. I went to check it out and noticed that the hall next to my floor was soaked, that my restroom was soaked, and that my closet was soaked. My kitchen sink, my bathroom tube, and the sump next to my water heater all had black stuff coming out of those drains. I immediately informed maintenance and the apartment management and they set someone to tare out some of the subflooring, dry the flooring, and the next day had someone shop-vac the affected areas. They also sent someone to do ""additional preventative maintenance."" Now today I am living with the same flooring, and the same sewage filled walls. (Ok not filled but some parts are black where it was white).Today the same thing happened, but to a much lesser extent. (Black stuff only came from the sump next to my bedroom). This time they only put a snake down in the sump and are going to only shop-vac it.What are my legal rights in this case? What should I expect from my landlord in this case? Could I get charged these damages that is beyond my control if they are not addressed immediately (ei the black walls and discolored flooring)? And if so what should I do?I have evidence in a form of personal memo, maintenance reports, and pictures from this incident, as well as other incidents.

There's not enough time for me to order a new copy by mail.Here are the options as I understand them:A. Be honest, but try to convince the clerk that me not having my certified decree of divorce isn't a showstopper; I've got my Catholic Church annulment decree, which they won't grant without a divorce, and can view my case online on the San Diego court website.Downside is I don't think this will work.B. Fudge the paperwork.  Getting caught concerns me;  but if the prothonotary is able to look up my marriage record, why would they need me to answer in the first place? Also, wouldn't they be able to also see divorce records?Downside here is I really don't want to lie, aside from possible legal consequences.  I'm not trying to commit bigamy, it's a legal marriage, but...  Paperwork.C. Take time off work, several days to fly to San Diego and try to get my records in person.Downside: hundreds of dollars, time lost at work, etc.I'm kind of at an impasse and would greatly appreciate advice from people who know about Pennsylvania marriage law.

303	Girlfriend's PC started freezing and crashing randomly. We're not able to figure out what's wrong.	"So recently there was the Windows 10 update and ever since then my girlfriend has been having really weird issues with her computer. It's always the same problem. After some use  programs on the PC will stop responding or loading anything, the mouse turns into a loading wheel, and nothing becomes clickable and then the computer freezes up completely. She has to force shut down the computer.This is her description of the issue:*At random, two specific apps (steam and discord for sure, but also seemingly windows update as I last had issues with that giving me an error code like 800x800005? i think. when I checked it for funsies) will stop loading any new info as if they can't or aren't connected to the internet. though if i'm in a discord call it will stay up. from there, my PC degrades, either not allowing me to ctrl+alt+del or do anything other than open my start menu. it'll slowly get worse this way until it freezes. screen still shows, just the circular loading ring will keep going, and nothing will happen (HDD access light on case goes off, no sounds of use/stress on components.)*It also started doing this to her on startup too and it seems to reproduceable. She's tried reseating her RAM, her GPU, and has even done a fresh install of Windows by reformatting through installation media. The issue still persists. Any guidance will be much appreciated!"

434	How should I use my $1700 auto insurance claim payout?	"Here's what happened: there was a storm and a tree limb struck our parked car. I reported this to my auto insurer, they sent an agent to check out the damage, and shortly after deposited about $1700 in our bank account. This amount is their estimate of repair costs minus a $500 deductible for non-collision damage.My wife and I were actually not expecting any payout unless we went and got it repaired, which we did not intend to do since the damage is purely aesthetic (several large dents on the rear quarter panel). But since they've deposited money in our account already, we're now wondering what we should do. The obvious option is to spend it on repairing the damage, which we haven't ruled out and I'm working on finding a place to go get an estimate from, but which we're not sure we *want* to do. The main reason being, it may end up costing us ~$500 (if the insurance estimate is accurate), and the car works just fine, it just looks ugly with the damage. So my question is basically would it actually be *more* responsible to spend this money paying off some of our debts? Would love to hear from folks who have been in a similar position, thank you!Here are some potential alternative uses I'm considering:* We have about $6k in credit card debt between the two of us and this would be enough to pay the remaining balance on the highest interest card. * Pay off the remaining balance on the auto insurance itself. I pay $115/month for auto insurance and if I pay off my remaining balance ($1266), I'll have that money back each month to put toward debt.* Place in savings account to accrue interest until we are (credit card) debt free and making the repair would be an easier choice to make.Additional details: We use basically every dollar we make monthly after necessary expenses to pay off debt and put in savings, so this is not a trivial amount of money for us (it's about the cost of our monthly rent + utilities)."

My credit card from there has a balance of $447.64 that I owe, and an interest rate of 15.5%Current Monthly payments of $25.00Card two is from another credit union that I had to open an account with to get my car loan. $403.26 is what I owe them with an interest rate of 16.5%. Current monthly payments of $25.00Card three... is a Best Buy credit card I opened to purchase a new computer I needed for work. It was a $1,000 purchase back in September of 2017. I have it down to $864.99. There‚Äôs zero interest owed on this card so long as I pay it off in the 12 month promotional period. Otherwise, I will be back charged all the owed interest...I‚Äôve only been making monthly payments of $27.00 on this.

440	Feeling a little lost on how to finance a renovation of a unexpectedly inherited home.	"My wife unexpectedly came into possession of her grandfather's old house. It is bought and paid for (i.e. there is no money owed on the home). Since we were struggling with affording the rising cost of living where we were living at the time, we decided to make the jump and move into this house to try and save some money / finally be homeowners. Even though we knew this was a risky move, we still didn't plan well enough for this big life event financially. We have no savings and are living off of just one income until I can also find work. While this works for the time being, it doesn't easily afford us the chance to do some very necessary and big repairs to the home. And in a way we're kind of caught in a cyclical trap of sorts. Let me explain:* The area we live in is prone to hurricanes, so we need to get the house insured asap.* We can't get homeowner's insurance until the house passes a 4 point inspection* To pass this, we need a new roof and a functional heater* We can't afford to pay for these things without financial assistance* We looked into getting a home equity loan or line of credit, but we need insurance first. Also we don't make much money at the moment and are unsure how well our credit scores are doing ( I think that mine is okay since I've been paying off a student loan and credit card on time, but I haven't checked it lately).TL:DR we got a house for free but it needs work. To work on it we need a loan. To get a loan we need insurance. To get insurance we need to fix the house.I know we're not in a totally unsolvable situation, but I was wondering if anybody out there had any helpful advice to offer to a dude who has unwittingly gone from 0-60 mph in the world of fiscal responsibility.

441	Home buying dilemma	"Hi everyone,I posted a while back about selling our home and buying a new one and I'm here for more advice.We got a buyer and are under contract. We expect to net maybe 22k from our sale.Homes where we are moving are 135k, so max we can put down is 15% and we'll have to pay PMI.Our credit scores are lower than we thought. SO's is 685, mine is 699. Our loan officer is offering interest rates of 4.0% for an FHA loan and 4.75% for a conventional loan. SO is trying to shop around for better rates.FHA has a PMI of $84/month for 11 years if we put 10% down.Conventional loan has a PMI of $71/month.(This was with 10% down for a loan of 142k so it might reduce slightly with 15% down on a smaller loan)Questions:Should we wait till we have saved up 20% to avoid PMI, and maybe have better credit scores? The downside of this is interest rates might rise too and eliminate any savings. We'd also have to pay rent and possibly pay to break a lease in January/February. Not to mention moving costs and a baby on the way in December.FHA vs conventional loan? We want to make additional payments and have the PMI drop, which wouldn't happen with an FHA loan. We would be stuck paying PMI for 11 years but with an ultimately lower monthly payment. ($40 less because of lower rates) It's also a seller's market with homes flying off the market and sellers may be reluctant to accept an offer with FHA rules tied to it. Any and all advice is welcome. We're 26, and the homes where we're moving can only appreciate since it's a college town.Thank you!"

My grandparents have been in a precarious financial situation for several years with declining health and a house that needs lots of repairs. They are in their 80's.Somehow they got this company to lend them $12k and are paying about $450 per month to them. They have Social Security and a pension check that total around $2k per month.My grandma pays all her bills in person, including this bill. In April she went into the branch and was told that she could skip April's payment. She took them at their word and did not make that payment. She was called a few days later and they demanded payment. Since April she has been 1 payment behind. They call her dozens of times per day.She simply cannot afford to pay back this loan. They can barely afford to eat.If she doesn't make the payment, what can they do to them? I assume they will sue and they will win, but can they garnish their Social Security and pension? If One Main has a lien put on their house, can they force my grandparents to sell the house?I don't know why they felt the need to get this loan, it is for something they did not share with us, but I assume it was for repairs to the home. They went through another financial setback several years ago and their credit was trashed from it.Any advice would be appreciated. They live in Wisconsin."

I would have entirely different job responsibilities, but to put the position into perspective there are about 20 employees with my current title and 1 person with the new title.

Tuition, car and health insurance, cell phone bill, rent, and some food expenses. I pay for my gas and any personal items, including some food expenses. I have $22k in a bank account as an inheritance from my deceased grandfather. I work a part-time job at my college that can only go up to 20 hrs a week per University policy. I have 5-6 quarters left at my school before I can graduate. I am graduating with a liberal arts degree but plan to complete the prerequisites for vet school at a community college and work full-time before applying.My mother handles most of the finances and is constantly complaining to me about the expenses of sending me to school, paying for everything for me, and more recently is now complaining about paying health bills for me, saying I go to the doctor unnecessarily. The health bill thing is a bit confusing as the only real bill she's had for my medical stuff was an urgent care visit, but otherwise my visits have been copay only which I cover. This complaining has been going on for years and it is seriously draining and is starting to have a negative impact on my mental health. When I offer to take on my expenses through financial aid and student loans, she refuses, and says she and my father ""agreed to pay for 4 years of college, so that's what they're going to do."" I never expected this of them, but every time I mention it, she says the same thing.I am aware that I'm incredibly lucky to have my parents pay for so much, and that many people would love to be in my position. But the constant nagging and complaining is damaging both my own mental health, and my relationship with them. Should I just suck it up and reap the benefits of them paying for another year?

I recently learned I can take a loan from my 403b at 6.25% interest and pay it back in two years by using contributions to my 403b (I contribute about $230 a pay period, a 2 year pay back would be about $200 per pay period, meaning I'm not taking away from my monthly income).Taking a loan, I could pay off 2 of 3 card balances and then use what I was paying monthly towards my 3 cards and put them all towards the last card balance without affecting my income. Downsides: I'm stalling my retirement contributions for about 2 years. If I leave the company before the loan is paid back, I have 90 days to payback the remainder of the loan balance or I incur some large tax penalties (I feel pretty secure with my job, never had a below average performance review and I have plenty of work to do so I feel pretty safe).This is a no brainier right?

"Just submitted my final payment for my graduate student loans - it was my goal to get it paid in full by the end of this year, and I started the year with a bit north of $20k. That was emotional! Curious about insights on what to do with the relative surplus of income I'll have moving forward. The only other debt I have right now is a $20k car loan (got the car in fall 2018 and have been making minimum payments on it, 5.1% APR ). My original goal was to get the car loan paid off by end of next year, but I'm also keen on building up some more liquidity/investments....Info if it helps:1) I have about 4 months of living expenses in cash, most of it in a high yield savings account (1.8% APY) . 2) I max out my Roth IRA every year and also contribute around $6,700ish annually to a couple other smaller investments I have.3) I am renting, and I have no immediate plans to buy a home - but expect within the year to move into my partner's home and would like to do some cosmetic upgrades on the place, ideally, at or less than $5k? 4) I do foresee marriage and children in the near future (1-2 years). My partner has debt (not sure how much is personal and how much is through the family business) and no savings/no retirement funds set aside. This is a bit hard for me to wrap my head around. 5) I have two jobs: I do freelance work in one field and per diem work in another, so my income is steady-ish but not fixed and I usually get slammed in taxes. A few years ago I grossed just over $90k and owed $12k. That was a bullish year for me and this year I'll probably make about 75% of that.As I'm writing this, I realize I should probably spend the next few months hammering down to save up for taxes.

I've been in school for the past 2 years and I've been able to support myself thanks to a job that allowed me to work from home. It didn't pay much and I lived paycheck to paycheck but the flexibility worked extremely well with my school schedule. That all ended yesterday when my boss called me up and let me know that the entire regional team was laid off. I won't be receiving any severance and I have absolutely no savings. No emergency funds. Nada. I live in Seattle in a tiny studio, alone. I have around $6k in CC debt and I try to pay more than the minimum when monthly payments are due.

I plan on transferring to UW where I'll be getting the bulk of my CS education but that won't be happening until next Spring.I tried searching posts in this subreddit from people in similar positions but I couldn't find anything.

488	Should I leave San Diego after just moving here in August?	"I moved to San Diego from New Jersey looking for a change in life. First things first, I love San Diego and everything about it but everything here is extremely expensive. I just got laid off from work so I am living off unemployment and I do have money saved to go for about another rental year. My question is that is it even worth it living here?  Im having this wake up call where im starting to feel like I've made a mistake coming here and would have been better off moving to a cheaper state like Texas where 70k could go a long way. By the way I am a data analyst with 1 year of experience. I turn 25 in a few days and I am so anxious because i dont want to dig myself into a hole. What should I do?"

490	Asking for paycheck information before starting	"I start my new job on the 26th and I‚Äôve already moved into my new apartment. I am curious to know if it‚Äôs bad practice to ask about how much I‚Äôll be getting from my first paycheck, after taxes. I‚Äôve been through tax calculators online like smartasset.com and while I have a ballpark, I want to get a better idea for budgeting purposes.Is this a reasonable thing to do?"

491	Military Roth v Traditional?	"I am an E-6, married, no children, and late 20s in the Army and have been seeking advice on how to allocate my TSP contributions. I have gotten some conflicting advice on what to do. I was told by one financial adviser to move all contributions to the Roth fund because the taxes would end up being cheaper in the long run. Another financial adviser from another Post said to put all contributions into traditional for the same reason. I am not sure what I should be doing and was hoping to get some advice. I plan to retire from the military if possible. Thanks in advance!"	"All in all I think it is a toss up, so why not do some of each?"	8089hv	personalfinance	1	0

493	"Can't find a place to live that I can ""afford"" on middle class income."	"I gross right around $40k/yr, take home is about $2300/mo. I'm 1 year out of college and still live with my parents but I would like to move out.Problem is, the rent market where I live (Las Vegas) is ridiculous. Going by the 30% rule that I learned from here, I can afford $766/mo for housing, so I'd call that $700 for rent and the rest utilities.Looking at google reviews for places that cost $700/mo, all of them are 1-2 stars. Roach infested, people getting shot in the parking lot, you name it. I don't need to live in the nicest part of town but I don't think I would feel safe living in a place that $700 will buy you here.Cheapest I can find for a place that I would actually be comfortable living in is around $950 + utilities. I know I can't really afford that, and I don't really want to pay that much, but what are my other options? Obviously roommates but I really don't want to live with roommates."

495	Should I buy this boat?	"First off I know it‚Äôs a bad financial decision. But I really want one and I‚Äôm getting older and starting to think it‚Äôs time to have fun while I can. I just want some perspectives on how bad it‚Äôll be financially. Ask me anything you want. Here‚Äôs my stats:  40M. Single, no kids. Lowish salary ($85k). Net worth of $450k but $100k of that is in home equity. Total housing payment: $700 monthlyCurrent car lease:  $140 monthlyNo other real debt. Current savings rate is about 40% and that will be drastically reduced if I buy the boat. The boat I want is a 220 Sundeck (Sea Ray) and I think I could get it for a little less than $20k. I‚Äôd have to drydock it and I think that‚Äôll be about $200/month. Lots in maintenance and winterization.  So what do you think, financiers of reddit?  Live it up now or not regret it later?

497	"The most important line to read on a credit card statement is ""purchases"", I've decided."	"Late last year I added up my credit cards and realized I was over $8K in debt. I knew I hadn't been able to pay off the balances in a while, but every month I'd shrug, try to use the card less, try to do better. When I added them all up I was shocked. I started combing through the statements to see where I was going wrong. Turns out there was a lot I could cut out, so I set myself a goal. I paid as much as I could towards the higher interest one - it earns more cash back, so I was using it the most, then realized that was a terrible idea and cut it up. My one card I'd use for gas/repairs/emergencies I paid to an even balance that I checked every single day so I'd know how much I had SPENT - if I started the month at $5K on it and the balance was $5,700 I instantly knew I'd spent $700 so far.I realize this sounds totally obvious, but at 38 years old I just realized that if my spending is more than what I make, my debt will go in the wrong direction. I know what I earn every month so I easily figured up what that ""spending"" line had to be if I was going to start chipping away at debt.Credit card statements have these huge obvious boxes now about how your minimum payments work, and that's great, but I wish they'd highlight ""hey here's what you SPENT this month!""Today I'm about $4K in debt, a number that still makes me sad but at least I've been moving the right direction."

498	I‚Äôm almost 2 months in with no credit card payments. Both cards are maxed. I need some advice.	"For some personal reasons, I haven‚Äôt been able to pay off my cards and it‚Äôs been since May 18th. I‚Äôm nearly 2 months in. Both cards are over their limit because of interest and I‚Äôm just wondering how long I can go until I get sued or letters in the mail? I‚Äôve always heard bad stories about things that happen when you miss payments. I was fired from my job recently so I have no income. Trying to find a new job ASAP so I can start working towards these payments. I‚Äôm only 21. I feel irresponsible because both 1k limits are maxed.

499	Debt collector help	"I just now received a phone call, and the person on the call sounded like an appropriate sounding debt collector.  She told me my name and last 4 of social.  I said that was me. Then tells me I owe 164 bucks from an outstanding debt and asks if I want to resolve it. I told her I have no idea what the debt is, especially since in the past two years i have resolved all my debts and collections on my credit report (didnt say this part to her). She tells me it is from a payday advance from September 2011. I told her I am not even sure the debt is accurate.  I did do payday advances around that time but I believe I resolved all of them. I asked for proof, and was told that they have been sending me notices to an old address which I told her was 7 years old too. I told her I am disputing the charge and not paying. She said she will put that down and then see how that works out for me. She hung up before me. Totally caught me off guard. I am able to pay the amount now, but no idea why I should due to its age, also more importantly, its validity.  Thoughts?"	Did you ever apply for a payday loan online?	9cvj27	personalfinance	1	1
