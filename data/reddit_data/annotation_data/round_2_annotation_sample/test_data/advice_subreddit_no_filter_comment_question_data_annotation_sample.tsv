Introvert (17M) wants to make foreign friends	"Hi, I’m a 17 year old who’s quite introverted and deals with social anxiety. It really sounds weird but I’m really interested in people who are raised in different cultures or households than mine. I’ve always wanted to make foreign friends to learn about how they view the world and to enlarge my human knowledge. The main problem is that I have no clue where I can  find/meet these people on the internet. I find it really hard to engage with other people irl and on social media, but I’m willingly to step out of my comfort zone to seek out for these people. Do you guys have any tips or experiences in how to make foreign friends and start a convo eg.?(Ps English isn’t my first langue so sorry for the mistakes I’ve made)"	Where are you from?	dtx5b8	Advice	-1	-1

I’m not good at anything.	"I need help. Genuinely. I’m a 23 female and I am literally not good at anything. I work at Starbucks and that’s literally all I do. In school I used to play sports and go out and do things but I never was good at anything. I gave up volleyball because my coach never let me play because I couldn’t overhand serve. I never pursued anything else because I didn’t have a physical interest pushing me towards it. I started college and then dropped out because of tuition costs. Now I just feel extremely stupid and not educated at all. I see so many people just pick something up and just go for it but there’s nothing in my mind that says, you can do this. You can try this out and might like it. I have no interested in ANYTHING. I want to cry because I genuinely want to do something meaningful with my life before my parents die but I’m afraid it’s not gonna happen. Has anyone else dealt with this? I’m just so lost."

Asking a professor about his research even though I don't have the best grade in his class...	"So there is this professor who is teaching this one really difficult class that I have, but he is a leading expert in a field that I am really interested in, and I want to ask him about his research and potentially doing research with him. Now, it's not like I am failing his class, but I don't have an A either, and I am just scared because I feel like the students that a professor wants to work with or even talk about his research would be students that succeed in his class, the top students in the class. I am not one of those, but I am really interested in what he does, and I don't know how to go about this without him thinking I'm a complete idiot haha, the irony of this all is that I spent more time reading articles about what he does, than actually completing classwork..."

The salary is higher and it's closer to home, it's also relevant to my degree.&amp;#x200B;The problem is I'm currently moving departments at my current workplace (moving into finance which is what I studied at University) and I was looking forward to the switch.

I’m going to school again next summer and since I quit my job in March I always worked in the supermarket etc. but I got fired from my last part time job in October.

My savings are gone by now and I have literally no money left. I’m already looking for a new job, but even if I would find one by tomorrow I would get my first paycheck in January.

"Family issues with my sister, trying to parse out my emotions"	"Trying to not make this a wall of text-My sister and I have had a rocky relationship in the past, but for the last 10 years it has been quite good (we are in our 30s). She came in town and stayed at my house and we had a nice time.Just before she got in town I got in a major car wreck, have a concussion, and am heavily medicated,We went out to dinner with our family last night, and everyone was having a nice time, though at one point my father let me know I was being too loud (understanding it was due to the medication).My sister offered me a ride home. On the ride, she berated me for my behavior, told me I was totally wrong, and when I asked for a chance to give my perspective she flatly refused. I said I would like to get out of the car, as this does not seem fair to me, and she pulled over and sped off. This was 3 miles from my house, While I am on concussion protocol. While on heavy medication. In the rain. &amp;#x200B;I have let my family know this has happened, and they are currently trying to figure out a solution so that we can both attend Thanksgiving. Honestly, this is among the most thoughtless things that has ever happened to me, and I feel very sad about it. I am not sure how I should be handling it- but I am 100% sure I will not simply accept a half assed apology.

"Im 30 and thinking about moving out of my parents, need advice."	"So this week i sorta started looking at a apartment at impulse i saw on Facebook, its nothing great but its also not a dump and still not far from work (like 6 miles). I held off for so long because i got comfortable and because i have health issues from when im young that scare me but dont really affect me nowadays as much. (heart defects)I do plumbing and heating for a living and clear about 28k a year. The apartment im looking at is like 425 a month (rural area if your wondering), and my only debt is my truck which i only owe like 6500 on and is paid off over a year ahead right now. I talked with my parents about it and they support the idea but think im being impulsive (which i am). But i feel like if i dont make a move i never will and im sorta self conscious about telling people i live at home yet. My other thing is im suck a introvert and i feel like having my own place might get me out more, i dont have many friends and stick to myself other then work so i feel like im becoming really anti-social and anxious. My question to you guys is do you think im being to rash or quick to jump and do this? Met with the landlords today and they seem nice, and like i said even though its nothing special is a good size for a single person. They already got back to me and said i could have the apartment if i want it. Im stressing out over this more then i should be and keep talking myself out of it in my head but i feel like if i backpedal i will just crawl back into my bubble. Thanks for any help."

Best way to evict a roomate that isn't even on the lease	"I moved into this place only just this month. When I arrived I was informed of two things by the current tenants. #1 there are two cats that live in the house and we aren't supposed to have pets. #2 My roommate Lily (fake name)  is not on the lease and is not supposed to be living here. At first I was kind of didn't think about it. However, as the days have gone by I have realised what a terrible set up this is. Lily was allowed to move in by previous roommates who no longer live there. From what I am being told Lily moved in around December and was supposed to move out in April, this never happened. Lily now says they will be gone by July. There are several issue. For whatever reason the previous roommates who allowed this decided since Lily is not on the lease she will pay for the houses wifi as her way to contribute. The wifi is $80 - $100 a month. Those of us that are legally on the lease are paying $500 a month for rent. As mentioned above, there are two cats in this housed. Lily was the one who brought the cats. Lily occupies the most fridge space, the most cupboard space and is the messiest. My main issue is that she is essentially living rent free when she shouldn't be. I want her gone and am tempted to tell the rental company that manages the property I live at but am hesitant as I am not sure what exactly would happen to the rest if us that have signed leases and are legally paying rent. Would we be fined for concealing a roommate? would we be evicted?"

"My school nurse lied about my parents agreeing with her regarding my medication for a trip, what can I do"	"I'm a senior in an NC high school and I'm going on a three-day school trip to NYC in a week. I have ADHD and I take Adderall to focus in my classes, but I ONLY take it at school because its side effects mess with me a lot (loss of appetite, dehydration, sweating, and overall lack of enjoyment). My parents understand this and it was pretty much already decided that I wouldn't take it on my NYC trip because I won't need it anyways.When my school's nurse looked through my forms and noticed that there wasn't a form for Adderall, she decided she should call my parents and explain why she thought I should take my Adderall on the trip, implying that if I didn't, I'd ""cause trouble"" and my parents would have to drive from NC to NY to pick me up. My ADHD has never gotten me into trouble.My parents couldn't believe she would actually call us to say that, and stayed firm on the decision not to have me take the Adderall. That was around two weeks ago, and I just found out yesterday that she told the other people in charge of the meds and the trip that she'd talked with my parents and they'd agreed I should take the Adderall on the trip. But when I went home and asked my parents, they said they never agreed with her. But this nurse, who seems to think she knows my symptoms better than my parents and I do, disregarded what my parents said and lied to the other staff about their consent because she felt that she was right in this situation. Now thanks to this nurse, I'm going to be forced to take the medicine that ruins my mood and appetite on this trip even though my parents explicitly said they don't want me to take it.  I tried to explain to the other staff at school that my parents didn't agree with the nurse, but they didn't listen. They were patronizing, handling me as if I was just denying my parents' ""decision.""What do I do about this? is there anything I CAN do?

Freshman (18M) has a huge crush on me (19F)	"I'm a sophomore in college and I met this new freshman a few days ago. We're in marching band together and he's SO sweet and handsome but he seems to have a HUGE crush on me. Ex: he asked me to hang out multiple times, asks me deep questions when we're alone, followed me around at a party, laid his head on my shoulder.He's been super thoughtful and sweet and I wish I could date him but he's REALLY naive and I don't want to take advantage of him.

I'm 18 and don't know what to with my life.	"I have no friends, no work. I have everything I need from my parents e.g. food, money, clothes etc. My confidence is stupidly low.

I tried sports, I have exercised induced asthma and I suck at running. I played tennis in high school and have been trying to go to the gym since I was 18 but no matter how many times I tried it doesn’t stick. Ever since I could remember until the end of high school I was really into music, so I tried picking up a few instruments like the piano and guitar. I even took lessons for the piano for about two years. I never progressed past a beginners book and now I can’t play anything no matter how many times I practiced. I tried art like crocheting and painting but again I just wasn’t good at it. It’s not like I haven’t given these things enough time, because I’ve given them all years, I’m just not good at anything."

Flaky Friend. What would you do?	"I have a friend who I’ve known for about 1.5 years now. My husband and I both get along with him super well. We are interested in the same hobbies, shows, music, etc. and generally have a lot of fun together.The problem is that we rarely get to spend time with him because he is a major flake. When we make plans to see him (which we are always the first to initiate conversations or plans), he will only have one day that works for him in the next couple weeks. My husband and I will say something like, “We’re free on Monday, Tuesday, and during the weekend. When are you free?” He will say something like, “Only Monday works, maybe.” In any case, he always seems wishy-washy with setting a date.I have thought, maybe his life is just crazy busy.  My husband and I both work full time jobs. I work about 50 hours a week, so I get that. But we always try to make time for him. He currently only works part time.Once the day rolls around, we will get a text saying, “I’m gonna be a couple hours late.” Which eventually turns into canceling at the last minute after we’ve readjusted for two hours. There is never any explanation. Sometimes an apology.  And then the cycle continues. It is literally like this 85% of the time.We have not brought up this issue to him (which I would normally do) because he’s a very anxious person and sensitive. He tends to shut down when confronted and I don’t want to chase him away completely (which I realize sounds silly, but we honestly care about him.)In the end, both of us just end up feeling hurt and stepped on. We wonder if he cares about our friendship because he never initiates. We get angry when we plan our lives around seeing him and then he cancels, which inconveniences us, but more importantly, makes us feel like he could care less about us.So I guess my question is: 1) Am I even justified in being upset about this?  2) If you were in my situation, what would you do?"

How long should I wait for my landlord to reply to his email?	"I just moved in to a rental apartment a month ago. Something under the kitchen sink is leaking. It only leaks when the faucet is running. At first it was just a small leak. On Tuesday evening I emailed the landlord asking him to come have a look. He emailed back pretty quickly, saying it sounded pretty minor, and he asked that I try to tighten up some of the connections under the sink myself.I was not able to fix the issue, and I know nothing about plumbing so I was actually scared to make the issue worse by tinkering around under the sink.

"I met a girl a while ago who seemed to be pretty normal so when she asked to add me on snapchat I did so without much thought. We started chatting normally but after maybe 3 days (Might have been 2) she started getting really personal and began to give me in depth information about her life that I didn't ask about in any way. She became attached to me really quickly because I'm ""Easy to talk to"" but it's mostly because the majority of my replies are things such as ""Wow.. That sucks... Really?... I can't imagine,"" ect. Most of what she talks about is her severe deppression and anxiety, mental/emotional abuse from her father, severe and daily bullying at school, and her thoughts about ending it all. She says I'm her rock and the only real friend she has, but in all honesty, I don't like her at all. I don't want the burden of being her emotional safe haven or listening to her go on and on and on every day. She lives a few states away from me and doesn't know where I live, go to school, any of my friends, ect. So I could just block her everywhere and that would be the end of it for me. The only reason I haven't done so (and why I'm making this post) is because I'm fairly confident she would go through with it and end it all. I would probably never hear about it and nobody would know my involvement with her but I may be the only thing keeping this person from going through with it.

Actually I don’t think we have ever had a genuine conversation. I hate the fact that I have no idea how to talk to her let alone what to actually say to her. I don’t know whether it’s because she resents me for being a mean big brother or the fact that she genuinely doesn’t want anything to do with me. I really wish I knew what to say and how to speak to her. Maybe it’s just a phase that she’s going through (I understand teenage girls to a certain degree) but I’ve spoken to my girlfriend about this multiple times but she doesn’t even know what to tell me anymore.

Help with an attendance problem in college	"So my college (SIU) has really a really strict attendance policy that I wasn’t expecting. In the policy I am allowed 3 unexcused absences and my overall grade in the class drops a full 10% out of 100 every time I miss after that. This isn’t a problem for me in most classes as I am normally present, but I miss my first class of the day or am late on a semi-often basis. This really isn’t a problem in one of my classes because my professor doesn’t really worry about it, but in one of my classes my professor is really “by the book” and has dropped my grade from an 84% to a %64 based solely on missing two days of class over my 3 day limit. Today I was finishing up a project for the class and ran into a printing issue so I was going to be a decent bit late for this class (the class is three hours long by the way, and it is completely unnecessary), and my professor would count me absent if I am too late. So instead I took a doctors note that I obtained from the on campus health center a few weeks ago and used it to digitally forge a new note for today so I wouldn’t have more points deducted for another absence. I emailed him the doctors note and my excuse for missing class, like I had done with the original note, but this time he asked to me to bring the note to class, along with the original that I had used before. I have already thrown away the original note and the fake doesn’t really exist, so I’m SOL for turning in any kind of physical proof.

How to get someone to stop pitying me?	"I just finished a difficult semester. A lot of things went wrong for me in my personal life and I realized that I didn't have any support system to get me through it. When I was at my most vulnerable, I tried to open up to a friend. They didn't really acknowledge it, but the dynamic of our friendship changed.For example, they recently invited me to a party, but they didn't really talk to me during the entire party and I found it hard to connect to the other people at the party who I barely knew. I felt very alienated and disregarded. In the end, they made several remarks that made me feel like they didn't respect me at all. Quite frankly, I found the whole thing quite patronizing and dismissive of my feelings.The thing is that I wasn't looking for pity when I told them how I was feeling. I just wanted to tell someone what I feeling because I felt totally alone with no one to tell. Plus, the pity is totally unwarranted because despite what I had to deal with, I did academically well this semester. I now also have a parttime software engineering job and a research position. I did that all by myself with zero help from anyone. I am not weak and I don't need their pity.

I have spoken to her daughter who said, too bad.  I have preferred rent and I am worried my landlord will stop extending me the discount (about $700) if I complain.  I have reported the lady to Adult Protection Services, because the daughter and her husband scream at the old lady and I am worried that she might need medical care that they are not providing, which is why she screams all the time.

TNR Lady kidnapped neighbor's dog to teach him a lesson	"My neighbor is an old man, doesn't speak English, barely has any money, doesn't have any family. All he has is his Chihuahua. He's very sweet to her and sits outside all day with her. He lives on a side street and does not walk her on a leash and she doesn't have a collar on her either. Sometimes she will run out to bark but she always comes back.This lady who lives nearby traps and neuters cats and rescues dogs, will rehabilitate them and find them owners and asks for donations to finance this. At the moment she is living with over 30 animals in her house. Yesterday she saw the Chihuahua running down the street. She knew whose dog it was but was frustrated that he doesn't walk her on a leash or have a collar on her, plus he doesn't have money nor a car so he doesn't take her to the vet; she says her nails are too long and her teeth are bad. So to teach him a lesson, she purposely took her on errands before returning her to his owner at which point she found him crying, and she berated him. He gave her $20 to thank her for ""finding"" her.  I found all of this out because she posted it on Instagram bragging about it. There are a lot of poor Cuban and Haitian communities nearby and she likes to post about how she is helping these animals despite her ignorant neighbors' objection, and will often tag her posts with derogatory remarks. I will be taking the dog to the vet to help my neighbor.  **Should I call the cops on this lady? She is very nasty towards people who don't agree with her but I worry that the good she does for the community outweighs the negative things she does.**  *TLDR: Local lady who traps and neuters cats and finds homes for cats and dogs purposely kidnapped my old neighbor's dog to teach him a lesson because she doesn't agree with how he lets her loose and because her teeth and nails are unkempt. He is too poor to take her to the vet. He paid her $20 for ""finding"" his dog. She currently lives with over 30 animals in her home.

We like the idea of being on the top floor because that means we have no upstairs neighbors but it would also be cool to have brand new hardwood and carpet.

What do I do when I get forced to school while sick?	"(Sorry for the bad English, I'm really tired and it's not my first language.)I have been sick a lot the past few months. My immune system is weak, which causes me to be sick a lot more than is normal. My parents constantly refuse to call school. They are either convinced I'm lying, or that it's ""not that bad"". I can't call them myself because I'm underaged. This means I have to cycle 30 minutes to school, stay at school for less than an hour so that I can report my illness to the person in charge. This forces my parents to call and confirm they know I'm sick. Then I have to cycle another 30 minutes back home.This fuss obviously doesn't help my being sick and turns my 3-days maximum sickness into one lasting a week or more. I hate this because I really don't want to miss this much school. I've tried talking to them but they won't listen.So I need some advice on what to do.

AITA for not going on vacation with my family	"So, I don’t like going on vacation. Being away from home for a long time gives me really bad anxiety, on top of that I have insomnia issues and being away from home makes that 10x worse, plus I’ve had some pretty bad experiences on vacation as a child before. Honestly, I just hate it, and frankly I find it more stressful than enjoyable, between the logistics of the transport, lodging, navigating an area none of us are familiar with, and at the end of the day it’s not really worth the trouble. A day trip to the beach or the lake, or six flags or something, now that I can enjoy. A week in Florida? I’d rather die, honestly. My ideal vacation is a week off work spent with my girlfriend hanging around the house and doing stuff within the city.I’ve expressed this to my family multiple times. A few months back my mom suggested the idea of a week in Florida over the summer. My father and sister were on board but I flat out told her my point of view and that I wouldn’t enjoy it. She said “well maybe you’ll change your mind once it starts to get hot out”, told her it’s not likely and that I’m not dedicating myself to such a trip, especially so far in advance.Fast forward to now and she asks if I’m ready for Florida next week. I tell her no, I’m still not interested in going. Her and my father then flip out on me, telling me they already paid $500 for me to go and that I’m being ungrateful. I told her I specifically said I didn’t want to go and they shouldn’t have spent that money. So after an hour long rant about how I’m unappreciative, rude, that I “don’t want to spend time with my family”(which I do, just not in Florida) etc.. they’ve decided to go without me and let my cousin take my place. Not that I would’ve gone either way.While I understand that this is an opportunity I’m lucky to have, and a lot of people would kill for, I don’t think it’s fair for them to force me into a week that would be incredibly stressful and unenjoyable for me. But my family apparently disagrees. So I ask you Reddit, am I the asshole here?"	To calm them down maybe suggest a more local holiday?	crecdg	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA: Dad is livid because I asked him not to bring new girlfriend to my wedding	"Backstory: My dad is the type to constantly be in and out of new relationships. Lately they've lasted around a year. I find it exhausting to constantly be involved with new women, and have expressed that I don't care what he does, but I'd like to not be involved.Last night, my fiance and father had a conversation where we all agreed to place boundaries on the relationship between us and his girlfriend (this one's been about eight months) - namely that we would only have to be around or interact with her when it had to do with my sister (who is about 8 years younger). This is especially important due to our closeness in age with his girlfriend - my fiance has run into people she's gone to high school with that happen to be friends with this woman while we've been visiting my father and it's extremely uncomfortable. I'm getting married in about a month. My fiance is having a surprise bridal shower thrown for her on Saturday. Today, my dad texted me informing me that his girlfriend would be his date for the wedding and all wedding related events (including that she would be attending the bridal shower that neither my dad nor my sister or I would be, thrown for my fiance). I told my dad that we would actually appreciate it if he would attend the wedding solo so that he could focus his attention on being the father of the groom, as opposed to on his new girlfriend. Especially since none of the family have met her yet in the 8 months they've been together, and he is the type to likely go around introducing her to everyone, which I think is inappropriate to do for the first time at my wedding. He flipped. He's livid. My fiance and I think it's a perfectly reasonable request given his history and the boundaries we agreed to last night. He thinks he ""needs to fill the void beside him"" and us asking him to attend alone is the ultimate slight. He refuses to come without her, so we will probably cave and allow her to come. But really, am I the asshole?Side note: We did not ask him to pay for anything, but he has offered to pay for the cake."	INFO: Did you give your father a +1?	cweoxp	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for pretending I was listening to someone's story when I really wasn't?	"Not all, but most of the time I'm told a story or something that requires my attention for a few minutes or more, I usually end up drifting to another train a thought and completely forget the fact someone is talking to me. I did this to my grandfather last night as well as other times. He was telling me a story about his time in the Vietnam war, which I'm actually fascinated by, and he said something that made me drift off into another world. By the end of his story he asked whether or not I agree and I just took a shot in the dark and said yes. He didn't seem to notice that I wasn't paying attention and luckily saying yes worked. While I was off in another world, I was still making eye contact with him making it seem like I actually was paying attention. I feel bad because I do this more than I like to admit. If I hear a word that reminds me of a certain memory or story in my life, then i tend to lose focus on who's actually talking to me. So reddit, please let me know if IATA or not."	I'm sorry.......

AITA for refusing to let my 10-year-old daughter out of the bathroom until she washed her hands thoroughly?	"Alright so, my 10-year-old daughter has a real problem with washing her hands. She has some developmental disabilities, hates showers and washing her hands, but she still understands why she needs to clean herself and why it’s important. These past few weeks, I’ve noticed that the underside of her fingernails are caked with dirt and who-knows-what. When she gets close, I get whiffs of garbage and sewage. I have no idea why she’s not embarrassed by this, I’m sure kids at school have noticed, I’ve sent her to go wash her hands several times and it just doesn’t work. Her mother will say “oh, but her disabilities” as though this is something she doesn’t have to learn.Yesterday, I snapped and dragged her over to the bathroom. I showed her the soap and a nail brush and demonstrated how to thoroughly wash her hands. I refused to let her out of the bathroom until she’d scrubbed her hands clean to my satisfaction. She started crying and whining that I was being mean and unfair, but I was firm on it. Finally, after she scrubbed her hands several times, she showed me that they were clean. I said, “That wasn’t so bad, right? If you do it often it won’t even take that long.” She nodded, I gave her a hug, and that was that. My wife came up to me and started screaming at me for imprisoning our daughter and treating her like she was a 3-year-old. We’ve had so many disagreements over this. I said that she was treated our daughter like a child for not enforcing rules just because she has some disabilities, and asked her if she wanted our daughter to grow up to be a functional adult or not. My wife said “you abused and terrified her, if I was smart I would take her and leave” and I told her if that is what she wants, fine, but I have our daughter’s best interests at heart.AITA?"

"AITA for telling this one acquaintance to ""not eat my food if you don't like it""?"	"This one acquaintance (we'll call him Alan) and I are not friends. He's only a friend of a friend of a friend but he usually tags along with my friend group for social things. To me, he's a little bit social awkward but that's besides the point. &amp;#x200B;Yesterday, friends and I threw ourselves a random potluck party last night just because. Since I can't cook or bake, I mentioned in the group chat that I'd be bringing ham rolls. Alan responded to the message, asking what kind of ham rolls that I'd be bringing. I answered ""it's just ham, cream cheese and pickles."" Then he replied, ""well I don't like pickles...I might just eat the cream cheese and ham and then throw all the pickles away."" &amp;#x200B;I was really offended by this comment. First, while it's ok not to like pickles, do you have to really text it to the group for everyone to see? Second, I don't care if you don't eat them at the party, but saying you'd throw them away to the person making them is quite insensitive. I didn't respond to Alan in the group chat. I just let that go.&amp;#x200B;Fast forward to the party. Alan asked me about the ham rolls again. I casually told him in a joking way, ""if you don't really like pickles, then don't eat them...it's perfectly ok....I don't want to waste food."" He then said, ""wow okay.."" under his breathe and then walked away. &amp;#x200B;I instantly felt bad because it sounded harsh but that's not my intention at all.

AITA for skipping my sister's graduation?	"My younger sister is graduating from a very large university this weekend, and thus the ceremony is split into two days: Friday was the general commencement, Saturday (today) is where each college within the university holds their own ceremonies and the diplomas are handed out.My parents live overseas in S. Korea and flew in a few days ago to the US for her graduation. We all attended the Friday ceremony, including me, and I could tell my parents were pretty mad at me as they seldom talked to me.The reason is because I told them two weeks ago that I would not be attending the Saturday ceremony as my best friend and I had organized an overnight trip to Death Valley. My best friend is moving to the UK next week for his new job and long story short could only find the time for our trip during my sister's graduation weekend.My parents were understandably upset when I told them two weeks ago, saying stuff like how I could choose friends over family, but I thought they would eventually cool off before we all got together yesterday, so I was surprised that they didn't. My younger sister on the other hand is perfectly fine with my choice."	Did you talk to your sister about it?	c0x6yl	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
WIBTA if I told people I’m allergic to nuts?	For all of my (20m) I’ve never liked any type of nut or legume.  They are pasty and make my mouth feel weird.  But since I’m not allergic people always just tell me to “try it you will like it”.  No matter how much I say I won’t they insist and shocker I don’t like it.  I’d rather just shut them down and say I’m allergic but WIBTA towards people who do have legitimate allergies?	InFO - have you been tested for a nut allergy?	e8s0uh	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for removing my coworker’s food from the microwave after he did the same to me?	So I’m heating up my food in the work microwave. The microwave only goes to 3 minutes and my meal needs 5. So I put it in for 3 minutes and go to my office across the hallway. So the microwave beeps and I hear someone open the microwave and restart it. I was a little frozen in shock. People here don’t usually touch other people’s food in the microwave. It usually just sits there until they come for it and people wait. I get up and go in the kitchen and someone else’s food is nuking. I got a little offended and pulled their food out mid-run and put mine in for the remaining 2 minutes. Well the culprit comes in while I’m doing that and we have this passive aggressive conversation. Me: my food needed more timeHim: well why didn’t you come in when it beeped?Me: I did. My office is across the hallway ...awkward standing around in the kitchen...Me: guess it’ll be nice when we get the 2nd microwave in here...awkward countdown continues...I grabbed my food when there was 30 seconds left and ran.

WIBTA Talking to a Friend About Her Weight	"I have a friend that has gained a lot of weight in the past few months. Part of it is definitely stress and I know that she is having some health issues with her thyroid too, but she also doesn’t seem to be making any effort to make healthier decisions for herself. I don’t want to make her feel any more self conscious than she already does, but I do think that she could be taking some steps to at least start getting back to a healthy weight. WIBTA if I expressed my concerns and tried to help her with forming some healthy habits?"	Or are you worried about her?	cxi540	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for completely ignoring a friend I once pursued	"There comes a time in a man's life, at least for those who are not good with girls, when one realizes something is seriously wrong with their dating game and they have to go fix it. After losing weight, reading fashion, psychology self-help, and *killing* neediness I was able to lift myself up... except all this happened because of a female friend who rejected my romantic advances (""eww no"" actually stings more than you think).Fast forward to half a year later, I'm at this casual work conference. Lots of people shaking my hand, lots of compliments. Out of the blue, I hear her voice call my name... she has a hand raised rather enthusiastically to high-five as if we're close (we *were* close, in a sense, long ago when people teased we were a couple). And I just... I walk past her.And it felt *soooooooooo* good. More than the sum total of girls I approached this year combined, the phone numbers, the rejections I braved to become a better man and learning how to move on. She was the epitome of the dating life I wanted to leave behind: nice guy texts she eventually stopped responding to, driving her around, having platonic lunch together. She was the final straw that cracked my nice-guy dating paradigm. It made sense to just fade away and have some self-respect... so greeting her a happy birthday (months ago) was the last thing I ever did before we just kinda stopped being friends.I didn't even have a smug face on, I just took the coffee I ordered at the nearby stall and continued walking. Am I an asshole?"	"I get it might have stung when she rejected you, but was she ever outwardly awful to you?"	djl7lk	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for refusing dinner at my friend's house?	"One of my closest friends always keeps trying to get me to stay for dinner at their place. This person is a great, solid, give you the shirt of their back kinda person. When it comes to food I'm a very very picky eater. The other issue is that the house is, dirty. Constantly. Really dirty. I try not to be too judgemental because of the medical conditions (fibromyalgia) and the fact that him and his wife are much older than I am (mid 60's compared to my late 30's).I always refuse with some excuse or another, but last night they had food they know is something I really like. I did a big favor for them earlier in the day, and they wanted to show appreciation for it. At first I agreed to stay for dinner, then later after seeing the kitchen again, I came up with another excuse for not staying. This time, they didn't buy it. They were pretty offended and left me a voicemail that wasn't too nice.   Am I really the asshole on this?"	Who would want to do that??	d3s5jb	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
WIBTA if I ordered custom cat socks for my gf?	"Weird title, I know. Also on throwaway just in case.&amp;#x200B;So, my girlfriend signed up to foster kittens which were supposed to only be with her for 3-4 weeks to get big enough. Lo and behold, she got attached after they stayed more than twice the initial time. She's super bummed out and may not be able to adopt them both, as she wants to keep them together. Her landlord made a special case for her to foster them and it may not stand for the rest of the lease.&amp;#x200B;I just found a site (and I'm sure there are other ones) that you can put a picture of your pet on some custom socks. I was thinking one of these for Christmas but am afraid it would really bum her out and ruin her holiday. Socks have a bit of a special place in our relationship but I still don't want to bring up the hurt of her having to give them up.&amp;#x200B;Note: She has to make a decision by Thursday so I guess if she does keep them, it's a pretty cool gift. If she doesn't, well, see above."	Is she usually quick to be emotional?	dv2po8	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for not wanting to hear about my best friend's relationship problems anymore?	"My best friend is a great person, but she could really use some work with picking good partners for herself because the past countless relationships of hers (including this one she's in now) are always the same: she meets a guy she barely knows, starts dating him shortly after, gets into problems with the guy, vents to me about it and vows to end the relationship when really the cycle just continues until the relationship miraculously ends and she gets with another guy in the same manner.      To be fair, almost all of the situations she gets into aren't her fault, as the dudes she dates always screw her over, but after seeing this happen every single time with every single guy she dates, I'm starting to think that this really is all her fault for not learning from her past experiences and not sticking to her preferences (or just not date anyone crazy). I've become mentally exhausted from hearing her vent about the same relationship problems all the time, but she comes to me because she wants my opinion on what she has to say, and she's my close friend, so I feel obligated to hear her out. I've also been tired of giving her advice only for her to do nothing with what I've told her. I don't expect my advice to be followed or anything, but it's frustrating when she's always asking for it and following up with ""you're so right"" and promising that something will be done when really nothing does happen.This dilemma has made me wonder about the purpose of advice giving, and it makes me feel bad for being tired of listening to the same thing all over again when it's my best friend. AITA for not wanting to hear anything about this from my friend anymore? We're in our early twenties if that's needed context."

AITA for not eating the food my coworkers wife made?	"My coworker got everyone together to let us know his wife was bringing lunch for everyone, she came in at lunch time with beans, rice, and some dish made with goat, I wasn't feeling it so I went out to my car, now everyone is asking why I didn't eat anything. I feel like I kinda disrespected his wifes cooking, but I dont know. Am I the asshole? "	Did you take the meal and leave it?	a822ym	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for eating a lot at a wedding buffet?	"I (17M) eat a good amount of food. Based on my body type and physical activity, I've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.My aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. It was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/DJ meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.This was problematic because I needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as I had only been excused for the morning one. I ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. I only ate a protein bar during the drive, so I was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.I loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. I was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. She had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if I was still hungry I could make something when we got home.Now, I would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. I ate a good amount, but I doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.She eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. I would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. There was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.Once we left, my mom went on a rant about how I was ""making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day."" I told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and I wasn't depriving anyone else since I went back for more once most people were done.I'm not sure if I violated some social norm, but I feel like I was justified. AITA, Reddit?EDIT: I don't know if this matters, but I was mainly eating chicken and lamb, not veggies or rice/bread. There was still some leftover, though."

Aita for wanting my sons pictures off of facebook??	"I (f25) have a child (6) with my ex (m27). We have both moved on and have found new partners. We have a hard time co-parenting but I have tried to make it work as best as I can. I don't really post on social media and one thing I refrain from posting are pictures of my son.  I asked him to please not post pictures of him either and so far he has been nice enough not to do so.  The problem is that I found out his wife is posting pictures of my son. I know to some it might seem ridiculous but I want to know if I would be the asshole if I told him to please tell her to take  them down. I'm just very protective over our privacy and the people we surround ourselves with and not posting pictures is part of that. I have no problem with her, in fact I've never met her but I know she treats my son well and I just want him to be safe."

AITA for not taking care of my roommates dog?	"My roommate and best friend (basically brother to me) has had a german shepard for about a year now. He got her when she was about 3 weeks old and drove 2 states away and back to buy her. At first he took care of her in the best of ways. About a month in I could see him starting to lose focus of her, he had a full time job. And I would help with the basics, feeding and taking her out etc. Then he got another part time on top of his full time. I told him it wasnt a good idea since he already spent minimal time with the dog. Eventually I ended up doing most of the caring for the dog, and he realizes he has to get rid of her but constantly changes his mind about it. I've stopped looking after the dog because the more I do the less he does. So there are days where I feel the dog is neglected. Is it wrong for me to do that? I feel bad mostly for the dog."

"AITA for not trusting my ""roommate"" and then going through his phone?"	"I've been letting a friend of mine who fell in a rough spot crash with me for the past couple of months. I otherwise live alone. It hasn't been terrible for the most part. He offered to help out around the place and I only asked for money once with the idea being that he save up to get a place of his own (he has a stable job, just needs to get on his feet.) But then as I think is usual in ""new roommate"" situarions, little things keep coming up like using my stuff without asking, begging me to buy him cigarettes, and the apartment smelling like weed when I come home after 10-12 hour shifts. I have absolutely nothing against weed, I just felt it was disrespectful and told him that directly, same thing with going through and/or using my stuff without asking. After all that, I also found out he had one of my neighbors (who I've never met) over in my place without me knowing, when I clearly stated before that I'm not cool with someone I don't know in my apartment. He swore up and down that it was just for a beer and a movie, and I did believe him. Even so, I gave him the deadline of a full month to be out already because it became clear that the situation wasn't working.Tonight, I let the feeling of slowly deteriorating trust for this person that I consider to be a friend get to me. I ended up looking through his phone, and of course, in his gallery, found a video of him sucking some dude's dick in my bed from a full week prior to the aforementioned neighbor incident. I feel horrible for going through his stuff, especially since he's in the process of getting out, but also bad that I confirmed my feelings of mistrust and like I was disrespected. I'm conflicted about whether or not I should say anything and expedite the moving-out process, or just chill out and let it run its course.

AITA for cutting my sister out of my life?	"To start off, my oldest sister, battling cancer for over 15 years unfortunately passed away 6 months ago. She had a wonderful husband (lets call him Tom). They were HighSchool Sweethearts, He took care of her day and night as well as their 3 kids. Taking time off work to help take them to school, sports, etc while she was on chemo/fighting cancer. We were all very close and did everything together. &amp;#x200B;As of a couple days ago, I found out that her husband and my other sister are now in a relationship and have been secretly together for a couple weeks. I obviously had lots of mixed emotions about this. Mostly anger and hurting of course. Since finding out, lots of arguments ensued between my mother and sister and Tom. Things got ugly and my parents and I have pretty much cut my sister and Tom out of our lives. &amp;#x200B;As of today, they have made it official on Facebook and other social media. The frustrating part is that everyone seems to be happy for them and on their side, so to speak. So Reddit, Am I The Asshole for not supporting their relationship? I feel so confused, everyone on face book seems so okay with this but i'm just so hurt at the idea they're even dating now living together, with the 3 kids.

My husband and I both stayed home during the first 6 months and both took whatever parental leave we could. Then, I went back to work and he quit his job to be a full-time parent.In order to make sure our daughter is raised correctly, I made a list of things for my husband to help him out. That he would have a better knowledge on when to feed, sleep, etc. with our kid. I thought it would be only be nice for both him and our kid to benefit from Motherly instinct.

AITA For Pointing Out A Lady Might Be Deaf In Front of Another Deaf Woman?	"Hopefully this won’t be to long but earlier today I was at the local store getting groceries with my Mom. We temporarily parted ways so I could grab a few items for her. As I get to the cereal aisle I notice there is a woman in front of the cereal I need signing at her son who is having a fit, no big deal. Wait until she’s done and apologized for being in her way, she looks at me funny. Oh well. We get to the cash register and we’re checking out, same lady comes up behind us and starts unloading her stuff. Her lettuce lands on some of our stuff, my Mom turns around and tells the lady it rolled over placing it back for her. She makes a joke but the lady is showing no signs of hearing her. My Mom is a person who likes to joke at the register so she keeps trying to joke more with her but lady says nothing, shows no sign of acknowledgement to what she had said. I point out to my mom what I had observed earlier and mention she might be deaf. Of course, she might not have been deaf and was just ignoring us. I turn back around to the cashier and notice she’s giving me a dirty look. She had hearing aids in and I didn’t even register it. I wanted to apologize but the cashier just didn’t look like she wanted to hear from me so I left it. My Mom thinks it was alright, I was just point it out to her to prevent her from possibly annoying the lady behind us but the cashier really looked like she was pissed and wanted to say something.

AITA for not wanting to talk to my brother (15) after a traumatic car accident?	"I (20M) live at home with my mom and my brother. We are very different in terms of our personalities and our outlooks. We butt heads frequently because he seems to think I’m lazy and stupid due to me still living at home, and me feeling that he is unappreciatative of me working to pay for the internet, as well as contributing $100 toward my mom’s mortgage. He and I share the trauma of our father dying in a car accident three years ago, so as you can imagine this reminds us of a lot of pain and sorrow. Our great grandmother passed away 8 months ago and she left a 91 Honda Accord for me to have and pay for the insurance and gas upon me getting my licence. Last night, my brother snuck out of the house and took the car for a joy ride with his friends and in the process got in to a car wreck that totalled the car, and had had the accident happened a few seconds too early or too late would have killed him. I have been unable to stay in the same room with him nor be able to say more than a few words to him since. My mom is overcome with the thought of what might have been and wants me to talk to him. As thankful as I am that he is still alive, I feel angry. I feel like he took something promised to me and destroyed it with his carelessness. Worse still, I fear that this didn’t really change anything for him, and that he’s still gonna have the same arrogant mentality. I do realize that I will have to deal with this and talk to him eventually, but I just can’t at this time. I’m angry and I’m afraid that I’ll say some horrible things that I know I don’t mean and that I’ll regret just to make him feel hurt."

However every once in a while I pick them up if the number appears to be something I may be interested in (it may have an area code from a town I am familiar with, etc). Sometimes these are cold calls. I have a direct number at work, which means they have to have somehow internet stalked me to get my contact info, and then called me unsolicited. Sometimes I will engage them and try to quickly and politely dispatch them. However other times I just hang up without ever saying a word. This usually happens when there is the telltale 2-3 second delay between when I say hello and they start speaking. This tells me I am just one of literally hundreds of cold calls they make that day, and I feel justified in not even engaging in the 45 seconds of small talk it takes to get rid of them.

Growing up my church treated me like trash. My family and siblings were half black, poor and came from a broken home. That was plenty of reason for them to treat me like trash. I grew up and realized I hated these people and they didn't deserve my friendship. So I moved away without a word and rarely ever see them. We did do see them, they act like they are loving grandparents or something. Saying how much they missed me, how much I've grown. And here's the deal they can't remember my name. After 15 years. So I just stare at then and say bluntly ""Who are you?"" And once we get to talking about my life (so they can gossip about it) here's how the conversation goesThem: Where are you working? Me: A jobThem: But where? Me:A factory. Them: Which factory. Me: A factory.Them : But which one? Me: *firmly* A factory. Them: Oh where do you live? Me: An apartment. Them: but where? Me : downtown. Them: where downtown? Me: Downtown. And it kinda drops from there. Now I don't do this to everyone. The ones who were nice to me growing up get real answers but they ones who were mean to me get the short answers.

A told the GF that I'd tried to make out with him before (I've never tried anything with him) and she threatens to go to my Ex and our friends with the desperate text.A said that he doesn't want me to feel like I can't talk to him about stuff. He also said that late night texts can be misconstrued. I asked him if he would be able to tell me when I tried to make out with him and asked him to stop lying about me. He hasn't gotten back.Am I the Asshole for texting a friend late at night when I was sad and needed someone to talk to?  Did I come across like I wanted to hook up?  If your SO got a text like that from someone of the opposite gender that they've been friends with for 10+ years how would you react?  I don't think I was inappropriate but maybe I'm wrong?"

AITA for blocking my ex-girlfriend after moving to another country?	"When I was 15 I had a girlfriend that I had been dating for 6 or 7 months. However that year my dad got transferred to Europe and so I moved with him over the summer. For a little context, this girl was my best friend and we pretty much spent the entire summer together including when she came to my grandparents' house in Florida for our last week together.Before I moved we had talked and I had decided that we should probably break up because long-distance relationship as 15-year-olds, in my opinion, wasn't feasible. She agreed with me but she seemed on the border between wanting a long-distance relationship and breaking up.After I moved we kept in contact as friends and face timed very frequently but we had 'officially' broken up. After the first two months at my new school, I hadn't really transitioned well and was feeling depressed throughout the school day and then I would immediately head home to talk to her. I thought that the reason I wasn't very happy was that I still had a very strong connection to my life in the US through my ex. Around the same time as I started realizing how unhappy I was my ex started dating someone from my old school who I knew.  The combination of her getting a new boyfriend and not being able to move on from my past school life and commit myself to my new social life lead me to decide that I was going to cut off my contact with her, so I talked to her about it and then blocked her.

Since I'm a very quiet person who doesn't make friends easily, this has been a welcome change in my work life.All went very well, until he started making fun of my accent. (I'm an immigrant to his country).  At first I took it as a joke, went along with it, but then it started to be more frequent and more unpleasant. He started doing it in front of other people too. I did tell him I don't like his jokes and I find the situation uncomfortable, but he didn't stop.I slowly stopped hanging out with George, tried not to speak to him unless necessary to give me some time to think about this, figure out a way to let him know he's been rude to me.&amp;#x200B;A few days later he sent me a text and asked why I'm not talking to him anymore. I replied I don't mind talking to him, but he's hurt me by constantly making fun of my accent.

AITA for not wanting to get my hair and nails done for my mom's wedding at a salon and just do it myself?	"So my mom is getting married on V day next week.. she asked me what I was going to do to my hair. I told her I wanted to do it myself and had a certain style in mind. She insisted that I go to the Dominicans and have them wash, blow dry, and straighten it. I wasnt really wanting to do that because my hair is slightly damaged from the micro braids I had in a couple months ago. And I was just trying to stay away from heat for a while. She said she just wants it to ""look nice"" as if I dont know how to do my own hair I guess lol idk. She said it's just for that day and I can wash it and do whatever to it after the wedding and she would pay for it (I'm not working right now so money is tight on my end) but I'm just like I really dont want her to spend her money on something that's only going to be for one day, especially when she has better things to worry about.. then my grandma asks me what i'm doing about my nails. I told her I brought my own nail polish and will do it myself. She then says the same thing my mom said about looking nice and she would pay for them.. I'm just like 😪🙄 I'm a 21 year old woman, I know how to do things myself without spending money on it if i have the necessary tools to do so which I do.My question is, am I the asshole for feeling this way?

AITA for giving a girl a toe massage in front of my girlfriend?	"My girlfriend(f25) and I(m22) went to a party last night with some of my friends from high school. It was fun and a quite chill night, but everyone started to get drunk. Two more girls from my high school came a little later and I introduced my girlfriend to them. While my girlfriend, one of the girls and I were chatting the friend hit her toe on the table and I felt bad for her and gave her a awkward little toe massage while I said poor you. The toe massage as I like to call it is nothing sensual, but rather one that your mom would give you if you got a booboo.A little backstory with this female friend of mine. While I exited a relationship 4 years ago I got lonely and planned to hit on this girl, without actually doing it. This was in hindsight because I was lonely and she was avaliable, but I didn't really like her. I told my girlfriend that. At the time of this 5 second long toe massage I didn't think of it in a flirty way as she is a good friend of mine, but my girlfriend exited to the balcony in anger.Girlfriend and I ended up having a fight because she thinks I tried to flirt with female friend in front of her. Her argument is that I wouldn't have done it to any of my male friends, and I do agree that I wouldn't as it would be weird.I think the reason my girlfriend is a bit more vulnerable to my behaviour is because I had a one-night-stand about 5 months into our (back then) long distance relationship, around 2 years ago.AITA for giving a slightly awkward toe massage to a friend of mine?"

AITA For not continuing to talk to a girl?	"So, this happen a little while ago but I started thinking about it.My friend set me up with a girl. The girl and I started talking and eventually set up a movie date over the weekend. Our plans were really last minute and convoluted and she ended up texting me saying she had some things to do but she would try and make time. She didn't get back to me so I assumed she was still going (where I messed up). I texted her ten minutes before the movie was going to start asking where she was. She said she couldn't go.We decided to meet up during lunch break later in the week. I was really excited to actually hang out with her. I texted and asked where we should meet up and she was really confused until I reminded her that we were supposed to hang out. She said she needed to make up some schoolwork so I didn't care too much that she cancelled. Twenty minutes (lunch is an hour) into lunch my friend, the one who set us up, told me the girl was hanging out with her friend. This hurt me.I confronted her about this and she said that she wasn't trying to avoid me or hurt me and that she would tell me if she didn't want to see me.

AITA for spending money on myself and not buying bday presents for my family?	"My stepmom has a pretty big family. Her sister, niece, father and I all have birthdays in August within a week of each other so usually one big party is thrown for us and we all open gifts.Now I’m in a weird spot in my life. I’ll be turning 24 this Friday. I just moved into my first apartment with my boyfriend and am still adjusting to spending this much money on rent/utilities. I’m paying of A LOT of credit card/student debt that accumulated from a lot of circumstances, but now that I have my first decently paying job, I’ve been making progress paying it off and I’m really proud of myself. However money is still a little tight for me.Knowing this I asked my stepmom if I could contribute a little bit to a gift for everyone together because I didn’t feel I could afford to get everyone something. She said not to worry, she would put my name on what she got them and it would be a “family gift.” And that was the end of it.I have been saving a little money but after the party I ended up spending a pretty decent chunk of change ($100) on a high end pillow because I have neck/back problems and keep waking up unable to move my neck. I also spend money ($64) on skincare stuff because my skin is really sensitive and I was having a hard time finding cheap stuff that worked for me.I feel really guilty spending the money I saved on myself and not buying birthday presents for my family members. My cousin is planning her wedding in Cancun for next year, which I know is expensive for her and she’s on a budget and she still bought everyone something. AITA for doing this? I asked my boyfriend and he said no, I saved up and bought things for myself that will make me comfier and I didn’t waste it on anything frivolous. I just.. feel guilty."

WIBTA for ditching a film project that is an absolute train wreck?	"Hi,So a bit of context. I'm a young director (22) who recently was approached by a really talented guy (Cine) to direct a short film. The job was unpaid - I would very rarely take unpaid jobs, however I was interested enough by the script to jump on board and put some of my time into the work.Unfortunately for me, the producer is incredibly difficult to work with. He refuses to do anything - whenever we need to make contacts, or get in contact with anyone, he will tell people he has done it when he simply hasn't. Time was running out in the short pre production schedule, and he still hadn't found a production designer, sorted costumes, props etc or realistically done any of his jobs.Cut to yesterday. I have worked with actors, done shot lists, rewritten the entire script repeatedly refining it and making it understandable, done a variety of storyboards and blocked the entire thing out. That's when I hear that my actors, who were supposed to liason with my producer have literally never even heard of the guy. Massive red flag. And one of the actors said the only thing from the producer they'd been told were the dates - the wrong dates. I was furious. I spoke to him and he full on lied to me saying he did speak to them and he just changed the subject when I provided evidence he hadn't. We have a £50,000 camera on rent directly from Sony, lots of equipment, but nothing else. The only person who hasn't done their job is the producer. Now, I am being asked to fork out £100 to pay for travel to a location I was told would be paid already, and we have literally nothing sorted, no costumes, no power, no props, no extras, nothing. We need these things.Would I be in the wrong to simply say enough is enough and drop out? I'm not being paid and now I'm paying out of my own pocket for this project. I've done all my work and more, but the producer is simply unable to do anything. Now he is refusing to even show up to set."

WIBTA if i kicked a ‘friend’ out of my social group?	"So to give some context. R started to hang around with me and my friends after she left her old friends. She was nasty to her old friends and they snapped one day after she purposely hurt one of them thinking she was being funny. She just sat with us one day for lunch and sat silent for about a week. We kind of tried to join her in although not overly tried since she just sat down and didn’t make any attempt herself. She slowly began to talk to us after a couple weeks but didn’t really understand half of the things we were talking about since we have barely anything in common. We didn’t want or need anyone else in our group because it was pretty good and we were just the right number. Once she got more comfortable with us she started being different. She slaps us on the arm hard to get out attention and pushes us around. She said some hurtful things to one of my friends about her dead brother and is kind of bullying a kid with autism (although she didn’t know he had autism until about 2 weeks ago). She is really quite annoying and doesn’t seem to understand her place, thinks it’s okay to be rude to people because ‘we are her friends’. She admitted that she used us completely so she didn’t look lonely the whole time. Does it even count as a friendship if she was using us the whole time? We never really liked her anyway but after she admitted that it just seems like she never actually wanted to be our friend for the sake of being friends but because she didn’t want to seem lonely.

AITA for asking my friend for help?	"Useful background info for this story: friend is half Native American, I'm half Asian. We've been friends since we were 4-5 years old. Earlier this semester, my mom found what seems to be a Native American decorative arrow in a Goodwill. It's framed quite expensively, so she thought it might be worth something if it's legit. After Google failed her, she asked me for help on finding someone to look at the piece and get us in touch with an appraisor if it's legit. I find nothing on the arrow, call some appraisers and they don't know the slightest thing about Native American art and artifacts, and I'm at a loss. This is when I remember that my friend recently interned at a small Native American museum, and might have an idea as to protocol with this thing, or might be able to get in touch with her old boss and see if they know anyone qualified to look at it. So, I text her and ask if she might know where to start with this thing, as I have no idea. I thought this was a perfectly fine thing to do as she had experience in a museum who probably sees stuff like this more often than your average person, but apparently not as she got upset with me for asking her because she's Native. I tried to explain that I didn't ask because of her ethnic background but because of the museum experience but it backfired on me and says that I hurt her even asking in the first place, and trying to justify myself was making it worse. I'm not denying I hurt her feelings, and I did apologize and ask for ways I could have better handeled the situation or worded the question, but was left with a ""whatever."" I hate to say it, but was this an overreaction on her part? It's not like I sent her pictures of it and asked her to identify it or appraise it - I just asked where I might find those leads from the most likely person I know to have them. AITA?"

WIBTA for not helping my co-worker?	"It's a 2 man team. We used to have very defined roles. I am the leader of the team. My job is more general, strategic and creative, while hers is fairly mundane. Recently she made some improvements to her output, which increased the time needed to do it. And at one meeting where management commented on her output, resulting in her having to use EVEN more time to do it. So she asked if i could take over a process, which took about 1 hour per week. I was taken by surprise and pity came over me so i agreed. On hindsight i shouldn't have. Ever since then, she had been trying to push more and more of her jobscope to me. It would be fine if it was a once off favor but she is basically trying to offload a few regular processes to me. I am responsible for the results of the team and if she is tardy, we cannot hit our KPI, i'm the one who has to face the music. I just can't stand having to constantly reject her request to offload regular processes to me. When i reject her she tries to argue and finally end off with ""k fine i'll do it"" when it was her jobscope to begin with.Should i suck it up and help her to achieve overall results or just her her be to be fair to myself?"

AITA? Privately let a flat and left it a disgrace	"AITA? So, me and the other half have lived in a family friends flat for 5 years. We moved out yesterday. So we emptied the flat, replaced furniture that had been damaged (cats had plucked couches so bought 2nd hand couches to replace them. They were a better make and quality but they were 2nd hand and slightly worn). Flat wasn't spotless but was clean. I had a call today saying they are so disappointed, they trusted us, they cant believe we have left it in the state that we have done etc etc. Their words: There is some paper under the bed, the table falls apart when you put something on it (we never had a problem) couch is such a mess (we replaced used for used) there is a stain on the carpet, nails still in the wall (that I agree with but I couldn't reach without a ladder and they were re-decorating so didn't think it would be too difficult to take a few tacks out while they were already up there). We have paid them roughly £20k in the time we were there so I think decorating, a new carpet (or a carpet clean) and paying for a deep clean isn't too bad of a deal for them! We replaced the broken washer with a brand new one - now 6 months old, found a new private tenant (saving them thousands in letting fees) and taken items to the tip that they asked us to.

WIBTA for asking fellow subway passengers to move so that I can sit down?	"So, I'm 8 and a half months pregnant, and I ride the subway to and from work every day. For my entire pregnancy, the subway has been a particular trigger for me: I get frequent low blood pressure attacks on the subway, including nausea, light headedness, and feelings like I'm going to faint. A couple of times I've needed to crouch near the ground just to keep from keeling over. Luckily, since I've become visibly pregnant, I've had generous subway passengers offer their seats about 80% of the time. Sometimes they don't, and that's fine - that's their choice. But when they won't move out of the brightly colored chairs that are specifically designated for pregnant women, people with disabilities and people with babies,  I do get kind of annoyed - However, I've never demanded that someone move because I am aware that some people have invisible disabilities and I don't want to embarrass anybody or call anybody out publicly.Now that winter has arrived, I'm often wearing bigger coats, which means people cannot tell that I'm pregnant and will rarely give me a seat. This has been especially bad since the 8-month stage, because my constant sick-feeling is being aggravated by my increasing size. I'd like to ask people in the bright-coloured seats to move (there's no way they can ALL have invisible disabilities) but I don't want to be an asshole. What should I do? Additional Info: I take cabs when I'm too sick to ride the subway, but it's too expensive to be an everyday option."

We were packing up to go to the neighborhood pool and I had been playing with them by bumping them with the floats as I loaded them in the trunk where they were sitting. I had loaded them on top of them kinda, playfully. I than turned the corner to grab something and I thought I heard one of my two kids kicking the floats out of the trunk, but definitely hitting the driveway. I told them to pick them up and load them and my 8 year old said they fell out, my 5 year old says he kicked them out. Without seeing it myself I couldn’t be 100% sure but given that I thought I heard them being kicked out and my daughter attesting to him kicking them out, I am relatively certain.

AITA for not feeling the same way towards my niece as everyone else does?	"The day my niece was born, I was obviously excited. But that was it, just excitement and curiosity. I didn't really feel love. I hadn't addressed the thought until I heard my other sister (not mother of niece) talk about how everytime she sees her, she's filled with a sense of love.Now, she's about a year old, and everyone in my family talks about her so endearingly. I wanna clarify that I don't feel jealous of the attention or anything like that, I just genuinely can't relate to what they say about her. I don't feel any connection to her past the obvious ""Aw cute baby"" feeling. And I can never grasp conversations about her either. Like, I don't understand how they can all talk about her so long because I just get bored immediately. Our family group chat is just full of pictures of her and then people proceeding to send many, _many_ heart emojis, call her cute, etc. It also isn't that I'm trying to act all cOoL and eDgY by not liking a baby, I just sincerely can't relate to how everyone else feels. And I feel really bad about it. I always try to interact with her, but it comes off as awkward and forced, which makes it obvious that I don't really want to be doing it. That, of course, makes my parents quite frustrated, especially when the baby's calling out for specifically me.I really wish I could relate to how my family sees my neice because, well, it feels like when people are referencing a movie you've never watched, and you try to keep being in the conversation with no knowledge of what they're talking about. It also seems as if this feeling is going to keep being there as I become older and reach the age of having children. That's going to be a major cause for me being a black sheep in the family (my family's pretty gossipy and throughout the years, I've heard various comments about other people along the lines of ""I don't understand how they don't want children, seems crazy to me""). It also just feels like I'm constantly being rude around my sister and her daughter even though I don't try to."	Maybe you could try and spend more time with her?	b4bmju	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1

AITA for buying him a birthday present against his wishes?	"I (29F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for about 6 months, and during that time we have both had birthdays. For mine, he took me a way for a few days, and brought me an (expensive) present. He is very insistent that he doesn’t like birthday presents as he doesn’t like stuff he doesn’t need. But given how much he spent on me, and given that it was the first time he’d had a birthday when we’d been together, I wanted to get him something. It wasn’t much, just a charger he said he needed and a gift card. Nothing compared to what he’d gotten me for my birthday a month prior. We got into a massive argument about it, he said I was making it all about me, and we’re currently not speaking. Am I in the wrong here?"

AITA for following porn subreddits and my girlfriend found out?	"I genuinely am at a loss if this is my fault or not. Today my girlfriend messaged me saying she used my laptop, and opened reddit to look at memes. Instead, apparently lots of posts from porn subreddits came up first. First of all, I’m not some porn crazed guy, it’s just nice to look at some times. Secondly, and rather importantly, it’s her birthday! I feel so horrible for making her upset on her birthday, but is this on me or on her?"

WIBTA if I don't invite my best friend away on holiday?	"So, I've lived away from home at University with my flatmates, I consider them all to be my second family. This is pretty much the last year we're going to have all together so we're going to go away next summer. My friend said if I didn't invite him he'd be really pissed off with me. I think he's being unfair with this, it's not that I want to exclude him, I just want to go away with the people I've spent the last year's with as a final goodbye. My flatmates know him as he occasionally visits and they're okay with him. My flatmates are not going to invite anybody because it's a holiday for us as a group, I kind feel like I'd be the asshole if I DID invite him.Thanks"	Is he going to do this if you went on a trip for work?	d85hna	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1

And I’m tired of her going out constantly and staying out till whoever knows when, then coming home and sleeping in and complains that she’s tired.

AITA for being rude to my mother in law	"I didn’t really know how to caption this post so sorry if the title isn’t descriptive.Over Christmas, my husband and I went to my in laws house to celebrate. My newly 18 year old sister in law was there as well. Since turning 18, my sister in law has gotten her nose pierced, a small tattoo and a few ear piercings. Just using her new freedom to her advantage. For Christmas I got her a few cute good quality nose rings from the piercing place I purchase my jewelry from (I also have my nose pierced, as well as my septum and a lip ring) and some tattoo lotion she asked for since her artist recommended a special one because her skin was reacting sensitively to the one she was usingMy mother in law watched her open it and went essentially said“I really don’t like the rings. I think studs are so much classier. I also really hate your tattoo. I think tattoos are ridiculous” I ignored her and told my sister in law I would take her to the place I went to to change her nose ring, since it’s easier to get a professional to do it until you are used to changing it. My mother in law said “No you won’t, I don’t like the hoops.” I told her “Well, she does and it’s her face. She’s 18, if she wants to change her piercing, she can.” And that was the end of that. Later I texted my mother in law about New Years plans and she told me I wasn’t welcome in her home until I apologized for being so rude and disrespectful towards her. I said I was sorry she felt I was rude if she felt disrespected, I was just defending sister in law and her right to do what she wants, and she blocked my number and told my husband I was the rudest person. My husband thinks I should have just left it alone and taken her to do it without interacting with mother in law, but I felt it was important to show my sister in law she had a supporter and someone who would defend her, but now think I was excessively rude. My sister in law says I wasn’t, so there’s mixed feelings.My sister in law doesn’t live with them, she moved out and lives with a few friends. AITA?"

AITA for not scheduling my wedding around my siblings time?	"I am having a wedding soon. Due to both of us being international it was difficult to find a good date for the entire family.Now we have found a date that really suits us and is something we'd like to always have as an anniversary - were very happy with the date and both our families are able to come over - except my sibling.They're currently way out of the country on the other side of the world and are upset that we didn't wait one more month until they're back home and closer - however waiting one more month would have meant my fiancees family would not be able to come over and my fiancee would be neck-deep in her thesis.Now I've proposed to my sibling for them to join us via video-calling but ""it's not the same"" (it isnt, but better than nothing?) and it's not good enough.Mind you if my sibling truly wanted to, they could come over - due to the super long flight they don't want to.AITA for not waiting one extra month to make it possible for my sibling to attend easier?"

AITA for expecting my daughter to be the best at something?	"My daughter, let's call her Ellie, is 15. And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. We've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.Aita?"

AITA for not wanting to make a big deal out of my grandma's surgery?	"My grandma is only 70 and pretty freakin active and healthy for her age. We are really close, I lived with her for years as an adult.The only thing is she just found out her uterus is all kinds of messed up. Nothing life threatening, it would just be better all around if it came out. So she is scheduled for a hysterectomy today.Meanwhile I just started a new job and have been up early with very little sleep for about a week. On top of that Ive been pretty sick.My mom and a few of her brothers are visiting my grandma this morning at the hospital. My mom expected me to be up and ready by 7am but she never told me that until this morning. She is PISSED. She went on a rant about how selfish and inconsiderate I was and just a bunch of horrible things before hanging up on me.Theres a few reasons I dont think its a big deal...- Hysterectomies are pretty routine. Theyre serious sure but very rarely fatal, and it definitely has a low complication rate for a woman thats already menopausal.- Im still texting and calling her with support daily. I dont really understand why I need to be there in person if shes just gonna be unconscious for hours.- Im ridiculously exhausted. I would probably sleep through everything anyway.- Im sick. Im hesitant to bring that around people at a hospital that might be susceptible to it.I love my grandma and like I said, we are close. Its not like I never see her, because I do frequently. But maybe Im looking at all this the wrong way?"	When did she call you and say to be ready by 7AM?	alql0q	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for waiting until I get my bonus in a couple weeks before looking for a new job?	"I work in an industry where I have certain performance goals to hit each year including sales and operational things. I hit all my goals for 2018 and always get glowing reviews, so I know I should max out my bonus when I have my review in a couple of weeks. The reason I am leaving is because there isn't anywhere for me to go at in company currently and I'm ready for the next step in my career. I am planning on waiting until my review and receiving my bonus before I start aggressively pursuing a new job with more career advancement opportunities and hopefully a higher salary. I can't help but feel bad because my company is great and seems to really look out for their employees. It's also not their fault that they can't offer any more advancement at this time, they're just too small and I'm not waiting for someone to retire before I take the next step. The other part of me feels like I earned that bonus due to my performance in 2018. I know when I go, it'll be a pretty big hit to them so am I leaving my company high and dry?"

AITA for not wanting my husband to hang a trophy caribou head in our entryway?	"My husband is a lifelong hunter, so are most of the men in his family. I got my own hunting license after we were married a few years, and I’ve gone with him for a few hunting trips. I even “harvested” my own pronghorn antelope two years ago. My husband has been planning a special hunting trip in Alaska with his family for next fall. They’ve been saving up the money for years, and he’s really excited about it. (I’m not planning on going with them for this trip. We have a daughter who will be two by next fall, plus I hate the cold.) So here’s the thing: he already has some trophy “mounts” hanging in our house. I’m fine with it as long as they’re not in “public” spaces. Our house has two stories, the top floor has the living room kitchen, etc. All of his trophies are downstairs, where we have a tv room, bathroom, and storage room/office for him. All the trophies are downstairs where people don’t generally go. But when he goes on this special caribou hunt, he wants to have it stuffed, and hang his new prized trophy in our entryway. As in, a dead reindeer will be staring straight at you when we open the door to anyone. Package delivery, friends and neighbors, door-to-door salesmen. And caribou are not SMALL animals. They have the largest antler-to-body ratio of any animal. This thing will be at least five feet tall. Which is why he feels that the entryway is the perfect place for it, it honestly probably wouldn’t fit in many other places.I have no problem with his passion for hunting, I’ve even joined him for some trips. We’ve compromised on the dead-animals-as-decor issue up until now by hanging them where most people don’t see them. He can show them off to some friends when he wants to, without having them be the focal point of the main living areas. I feel like it’s unfair to ask him not to hang it up at all, (it’s his house too, and this will be a trophy of something he’s planned for and saved up for for years) but I also don’t want to greet every single person that comes to our door with a gigantic stuffed dead animal head..."

AITA for joke-flirting at a gay bar?	"So my girlfriend's friend and his boyfriend invited us to a gay bar this weekend. The 4 of us spent most of the evening together, but at one point my gf went out with her friends because one of them felt sick. I stayed inside to mind our bags and jackets.This older dude approached me, he was obviously buzzed and he tried to start a conversation. I wasn't interested in talking until I realized he's actually my previous boss' son, which was funny so we started discussing how small the world is and all that. He and his friend then sat down at the nearby table and I let him buy me a drink, since he was buying his friend one too.I told him that I'm straight and here with my gf, but I don't think he believed me because he teased me about coming home with him so he can help me ""relax with a guy"" or something. I wasn't taking him seriously at all, besides he's like a decade older than me even if I wasn't straight and had a gf.However I found it funny that my former boss' 30-something son was hitting on me while my friend was probably throwing up outside the bar. Probably because I was already a little drunk myself and I find everything funnier when drunk.So I entertained him a little but I wasn't serious about it. That is, I asked him about the pool he apparently has at home, and what kind of drinks he has etc. but he thought I was being honest though and that I'd just leave my gf and friends and go home with him? When I rejected him he was pretty pissed off and called me a dick-tease, then left with his friend.When my gf and her friends came back I told them about what happened. My girlfriend found it funny but the guys said I *was* actually being a dick tease and that I shouldn't come on to guys in a gay bar as a joke, because they'll obviously want to take me to bed. But isn't that kind of a ""you asked for it"" situation, except with guys instead of girls?Am I the asshole in your opinion?"	"what do you mean by ""joke flirting""?"	d8l2lq	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for wanting to take a break from hanging out with my best friend?	"My best friend started developing feelings for this girl back in March. A few of our friends and I decided that we were going to try to help him get with her. At first he was excited and really wanted to get with her, and I was happy to help him. But for 6 months straight he was constantly talking about her, with no action. Now, I get it, he liked her and he was nervous to talk to her, but for 6 months straight, every topic in a conversation turned into a talk about her, and I couldn't just tell him to not think about her. One of the most frustrating parts was when he kept repeating himself on what he wanted to do, ""I really need to talk to her one on one in person"" etc, but he never followed our advice .Jump ahead to the end of the 6 months and he actually began going out with her. GREAT. I can finally stop talking about how he can get with her. Nope. This was his first relationship (he has also never kissed a girl), and I completely understand why he would be a bit nervous about doing things with her. But being messaged nearly every day hearing about their dates, or how annoyed he was at himself for not going for something, it got to the point where I just ignored his messages for a couple hours because I was sick of talking about it. After 2 months they broke up, and he claims that he is over it, when he clearly isn't. Any time I mention a girl he tries to give me advice like he is some guru, ""Well when I was with my ex"" ""Bro honestly from past experience I know that.."" , but he barely even held her hand after 2 months. He still talks about her to this day and it has gotten to the point that I don't even like hanging out with him anymore, especially when it's just us two, because I know he will just bring her up and I have to say the same routine phrases over and over again, ""No you're not in the wrong"" ""No I understand why you were nervous"" ""Don't be mad at yourself"" etc etc.TL;DRAITA for not wanting to hang out with my friend anymore, because he will just talk about his ex girlfriend, who I had to hear about every day for the past 9 months?"

WIBTA for leaving somebody with no furniture?	"This summer I let two friends who were made homeless by their parents (they are both mid twenties like me) move into the 3 bed house I rented after my last housemate moved. They continued to turn it into a party house, lose their jobs and spend all their money on drugs.I was sick of paying for them and their dog to live and sick of my home being full of drugged up strangers. I moved into my friends house and let them keep the house in my name with my deposit with the landlords permission so they weren't homeless. All I asked was them to pay the money they owed me after I was lending them money constantly. I ended up in a motorbike accident a week after moving and am unable to work. I am also a full time student. My savings were blown moving and looking after them and being unable to work has left me a bit broke.For the past few months every week they have given me more excuses and not paid me a penny, but have been able to buy drugs and alcohol and don't care a bit that I'm struggling. My parents have been helping me but they don't have a lot of money. I want to take the furniture I left them (sofas TV fridge freezer washing machine ect) and tell them I am selling them. I don't think I will sell them but I don't think they deserve my things any more. They will go into storage in my parents garage most likely. They have just started new jobs and said it will be weeks before they give me any money.It's just before Christmas and I feel bad leaving them with nothing but I feel like I am being taken advantage of here.

WIBTA if I complained about the way a restaurant served me food	"This post isn’t about my actions, but my dad’s. This happened a few weeks back when I was on vacation. My dad and I got to our hotel and decided to go out for food. We found a Chinese place to eat and walked there.When we got there, we were very disappointed. The restaurant (which was very small, which is fine) served us food in those white styrofoam boxes. When we got the food, mine was fine, but my dad was angry. I forgot what he ordered exactly, but he did not get what he wanted. He ordered some meat (pork or chicken or something) that was supposed to be cooked twice, but was cooked only once. However, he didn’t complain and just ate it.When we left, I asked him why he didn’t ask them to cook it again. He said he didn’t want to be an asshole. His reasoning was that they were about to close (we come at like 8:50 and they closed at 9:30) and that they just did a bad job to get us out faster. He also said that cooking it twice takes a lot of time.That made no sense to me. We still paid the full price for food we did not get and they never even mentioned their laziness to us.

My older brother was in charge of watching my family’s 3 large dogs (Two English Mastiffs and a Great Dane). I come home at 8 o clock and find that my leather pencil pouch, pencils, gel pen, and all my mechanical lead has been eaten and ripped apart.   My parents say that I should have put my supplies away and not left them on my bed but I think that my brother should have watched them better.   I want him to replace my supplies because he should have kept a better eye on them (although he did say that he kept them out of my room several times, I doubt that he did.)  Am I the asshole here?"

They only spend time with each other and the people they live with including me.

She is a blessing but can be a handful, as most parents can confirm. My wife luckily was able to get 6 months maternity leave through her company (awesome!) but has been dreading going back to work come the end of January. I just started a new job a few weeks ago and was just told that I, along with 5 others from the company, are being sent out of state for a 4-day long work trip. The trip begins the Monday my wife goes back to work. My wife, understandably so, was very upset about me not being around during a time that she will be stressed, scared, sad and all-around overwhelmed. After a night of arguing, I attempted to explain that there are a lot of moving parts with this trip and because I am a crucial part of what makes this trip work, I am required to be there. She was still so upset that I pulled every string I could to allow me to leave Tuesday morning instead of Monday, giving her assistance and support on her first day back. She said “that’s better but still not ideal” and continues to be emotional and distant from me. She will have help from our nanny during the day but is still making me feel like I’m just going golfing with buddies for a week and leaving her alone without considering her feelings.

My reasoning for switching sounds kinda silly considering that it has nothing to do with the stylist or services but my current salon is located downtown and I hate driving there. I have pretty bad driving anxiety as is, and I just really hate the location and trying to find parking down there.  I wish I could find a salon maybe closer and in a less cramped location. I know that this is a professional service that I am paying for, and we aren't really friends beyond chatting while I'm there an occasionally liking each others instagram posts but I would feel guilty if I just ghosted. I also wouldn't even know what to say if I did tell her I was deciding to stop going to her or if thats even necessary to mention it or just do it."	If you’re so happy with your stylist and almost feel guilty for leaving: why not tell your stylist that?	dskycu	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for being angry at my Mom?	"So today I got into a fight with my mom. I sat down next to her, and complained that I didn't really want to go to my best friends birthday party, because there were only three other people there, one person I can't stand, and two others that I don't know, but needed to go, because it's my best friends sixteenth birthday party, and I know that it's important to her.She then asked me, why the hell I really didn't want to go, and I told her that I didn't want to talk about it. Then she said: "" Well, then stop complaining to me."" I got angry, and went into my room, to calm down. A few minutes later she barged into my room, demanding to know what was up with me. I kept telling her that I didn't want to talk about it. Then finally she pushed me to tell her. I only gave in, because I feared that she'd take my phone or something else away. After I finally told her what was up with me, she said that I couldn't always keep my feelings bottled up inside me, and that I needed to talk to my friend about it. She's right about that, but- You should've heard the tone of  voice she said it in. Its that tone of voice parents always complain about, when their kids use it. Also, my friend is one of these people that hates confrontations, and always says what the other person wants to hear, so it wouldn't help anyway.Now my Mom is angry at me, and refuses to drive me to my friends birthday party. I already made arrangements with my best friend. I'm having her Mom pick me up. Haven't told my Mom about that. I'm afraid she'll get even more angry, if I tell her, because she can't stand my friends mom. (That's a whole 'nother story)So, AITA here?"

AITA for choosing to go to my friends birthday party on valentines?	"So here’s the deal my group of friends, 2 with which I’m living with, came up with a date to celebrate the birthdays of another 2 close friends on the 14th. I’ve been stressed with uni exams lately and when they suggested that date I didn’t remember it was valentines. We are a group of about 10 people and the only date where we all coincide is that one. They’ve also decided to celebrate it at my flat.My gf has got really upset with me because of this first off blaming me for that being the only date and because I was inconsiderate (even though I didn’t choose the date). She lives 5 minutes from where I am and refuses to come to the party. I’ve suggested lunch together and maybe after the party going to sleep with her at her flat but apparently I’ve already ruined her valentines and she doesn’t want to meet up for lunch that day. I didn’t suggest the date, it’s the only date all my friends can meet up, I’ve suggested other ways of meeting up that day and I wouldn’t mind having a “proper” valentines date night the following day. But she still makes me feel like im the asshole and I just feel tired of looking for solutions on my own and her being the one who holds the grudge on me ."

AITA for asking my wife to refrain from further drinking when alone with our 3yo son	"We’re on a family holiday and it’s all inclusive. It’s 9pm and our 1yo is on her last legs and I suggest taking her back to the apartment. My wife agrees, she is going to hang out for another hour at the bar before the entertainment starts that our 3yo has been excited about. Sure, I say.My wife can handle her drink and I trust her fully with our kids but at this stage she’s on Prosecco number 8 (I’m guessing, her glass was being topped up by waiters throughout the evening). I do know when she’s getting drunk however, so I asked her to take it easy if I was going to head back without her. Obviously this went down like a lead balloon and she took it as me trying to bring her down. That was not the intention, I wanted to ensure she was fit to manage a (likely) very tired and crabby 3yo or (just as likely) hyperactive one.As it stands I’m anxiously waiting for them to come back but as bad as it feels, I’d hope she’d have the same concerns if the situation was reversed."

AITA for wanting to go to a concert with another girl?	"First ever post on Reddit in my 2+ years of lurking so forgive me if my formatting or anything else is not correct. For context im a 24 year old guy and my girlfriend is the same age. So last Saturday I went out with a couple of friends whilst my girlfriend stayed at home, one friend was there that I haven't seen in a while but have been friends with for over 8 years. The friend is a girl.The night goes on and she eventually tells me she has a spare ticket to a concert on the following Thursday and she's upset because the person she was supposed to be going with won't be going with her anymore. It's for a band that I used to enjoy when I was younger so I checked my schedule and I was free that evening and said I would go with her so she wouldn't have to go alone. Obviously she's very happy as she thought she was going to be going alone and I'm happy because I get to see an old band that I used to like and get to spend the night with an old friend.My girlfriend on the other hand is not happy. At all. She is saying that I'm not allowed to go with her because ""just you and her going to a concert is basically a date."" For the sake of honesty and to get an unbiased opinion it is worth noting that when me and this friend were 16/17 we shared a drunk kiss - which my girlfriend knows about. But in the 7 years after nothing of a romantic nature has happened between us.  I can't understand my girlfriends reasoning because in my head I know how platonic our friendship is and it is the furthest thing from a date that I can imagine, it's just two friends enjoying a concert together. I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 3 years, living together for just over 1. We've been arguing about it for the past few days, the concert is tomorrow and we can't come to any kind of agreement, she flat out refuses to listen to my reasoning and is telling me I can't go. So, AITA in this situation? what do you guys think??"	Ask yourself: is a single concert ticket worth the fights and risk of losing your relationship?	9wzlmd	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
WIBTA if I don't invite my Friend's fiance to her birthday party	"My best friend is dating this guy for a year, they started dated few weeks after her birthday last week and got engaged last month (after 1 months of dating).  My best friend makes every one's birthday especial. She is very caring and puts in all lot of effort. For his birthday she took him to a very nice restaurant, got him lots of gifts (normal couple stuff). She is turning 25 next week and her fiance basically told her that he isn't doing anything for her birthday, she isn't a child anymore and should grow up. I texted him before this asking about his plans for her birthday. Usually I plan her birthdays but since it was her first birthday with her fiance I thought he would like to do something special. Anyway he didn't reply initially and then showed no interest. He then called my friend and screamed at her. She is heartbroken. I promised her that she will have a lovely birthday. Now I am going to plan her birthday and make sure she have an amazing day. Would I be the asshole if I don't invite her fiance. He was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression hence I am torn. &amp;#x200B;WIBTA if I don't invite him to the birthday party."

AITA for taking my time on moving out?	To keep a long story short I am a 26M with a pretty decent income. I currently live at home and pay a small amount of rent to my parents. I also help my dad out with chores since he isn’t in the best medical shape and help my mom shop and do chores around the house. My mom actually appreciates me being around since she is almost 70 now and can’t do everything like she used to. My 26F girlfriend also lives at home and hates it. She’s been wanting to move into an apartment with me and while I’m totally for it I want to find the right place. We took a tour of one place last weekend and while it was okay it was honestly too small and the rent was reasonable but I have seen lower. I told her that I want to find somewhere but it might take awhile for the right place to pop up. She seemed upset but said that was ok. I told my friend about this and he said I was being too picky and was being an asshole since she hates living at home and since I can easily afford to move out I should do it since I’m too old to be living at home. AITA?	Do you REALLY want to move out or are you just saying that to appease her?	cqcwx7	AmItheAsshole	-1	-1
AITA for locking the door to the room while my roommate was in the shower?	"My roommate and I share one dorm room. She has a bad habit where, sometimes, she’ll leave to take a shower and not take her key or cell phone with her. Usually it’s not a problem because I’m in the room. However, I do have a really ingrained habit of taking my key out and locking the door, so if I’m not in the room and she’s not in the room, I will do it without thinking about it. A couple of weeks ago she went to go take a shower in the morning, while I was asleep. I got up, got ready to leave, and locked the door on the way out. Fortunately I was just going to grab something for breakfast so she was only stuck outside the room in her towel for a few minutes.Yesterday, same situation. Woke up, she was gone. I was running really late so I rushed my routine and locked the door on the way out. When I got back after class, she was wearing the clothes of another girl in the dorm and PISSED. She asked why I didn’t look for her to see if she was in the showers when I saw she was gone and the door wasn’t bolted. I said I didn’t really think about it and asked why she didn’t call me. She doesn’t know my number by heart and couldn’t find anyone with it. One of her friends was there and remarked as though he was trying to be a peacekeeper that I REALLY should have checked to see if her towel was gone after the first time she got locked out and, if it was gone, gone to the showers and called around looking for her. I thought this was a little ridiculous and said so in a joking tone, but nobody was laughing. Now I have a bunch of people pissed at me because she’s more popular than me in the dorm.I wasn’t trying to teach her a lesson or anything, I honestly didn’t even think about it. However, thinking on it now, I don’t really get why it’s on me to always keep track of whether she’s showering to see if I should lock the door, when it would be so easy for her to take her key.AITA?"

WIBTA If I told my grandma to stop doing this?	"Me and my family are from Alabama and we watch all their football games every weekend together at my grandmas house. We got her a mini radio thing that she can listen to other football games on with her earbuds. But she uses it while we are watching Alabama play, and she has a good 7 second head start to hear the announcers before we do. And every time we get a pick or a touchdown or something, she yells “Woohoo!” Before we can see the play even start. I can handle it when we’re not playing anyone good, but it’s kinda annoying when we play auburn or Clemson or any rival team. I love her to death and I would feel bad if I told her to stop, but none of us have the heart to tell her we don’t like it. Should I tell her to stop? This might be too light for the sub but this is the only one I see fit to post.Sorry if this doesent fit the sub well."

AITA for suggesting that our band play a song with the N-word in it?	"I (26M) am the director of a high school instrumental band. We play at school sporting events early on in the year, so I usually prepare a selection of more popular music.One of the songs I wanted to play was an arrangement of a popular rap song. The score is all instrumental, no lyrics, but the original song mentions the N-word (no hard r) a few times. Since we were just playing the tune, I didn't think that was a problem.I gave my students the piece and the school received a complaint a few days later. Admin asked me to remove the piece from my selection, and that was that. I really don't feel like it was unreasonable for me to ask the band to play it, though.If it matters, I'm half white, half asian. AITA here?"

WIBTA for not telling allowing our third roommate to sublease?	"I’m living with two other people, after a falling out last year the third person said she wouldn’t be living with us because of myself and the other person. She would continue to pay her 12 month lease but wouldn’t be living with us. My friend and I were completely shocked by this. We felt everything was going great between us. The only thing we really did *against* her was last year we refused to participate/share harder drugs with her. She’s 90 pounds and couldn’t handle even basic things, weed. We told her that we didn’t support her cigarette habit she just picked up and we were worried for her. We tried talking to her only to be ignored. This was one of our best friends that pretty much threw us aside for god knows what reason. Well, after reading through our already signed 12 month lease, I noticed the sublet section of contract says “no sublease will be permitted unless agreed by **all** tenants.” She hasn’t even offered a person, but would t be an asshole move to just deny anyone she might recommend, if she ever decides to? So some reasoning/justification: 1. my other roommate was recently raped and living with strangers is a no-no for her. It’s not as simple as just interviewing a few people and finding someone she is comfortable with either. 2. We agreed to a three person house because we were under the impression all three of us would be living there, not two and a stranger. If my other roommate and I wanted a two person house, we would have signed a lease for one."

AITA for telling my sister to shut up?	"My little sister (11y/o) is annoying. She always interrupts people in all kinds of converstations, only to give her irrelevant opinion on the topic. Not only that but she talks so much that sometimes i am getting headaches just from listening to her voice for hours everyday. I hate eating dinner with my family or watching a movie when she's also there. The things she talks about are also really stupid and i couldn't give less f*cks about the drama going on in her class or what her favourite k-pop singer did yesterday morning. I tried to explain to her why it's rude to talk over everyone and force her stories upon people but she doesn't care. In case no one is paying attention to her, she repeats the story a couple of times until she makes sure everyone has heard it.   When i tell her to shut up because she's being annoying and obnoxious she doesn't care and just continues talking and talking and talking. My parents tell me that I am being a jerk for telling her to shut up and for saying that literally no one f*cking cares. According to them i only say it because i have something against her and that i want her to feel bad about herself. Am i the asshole for telling her that i'd like some silence and that she should just keep her mouth shut for once? I am M/19 if that makes some sort of difference."

AITA If I Lie To My Mom About My Major In College?	"Ever since I was 18 months old I’ve been a dancer. I was put in all sorts of classes, ballet, tap, contemporary etc by my mother, who was also a dancer but dropped out because of a shattered kneecap she endured in a car accident. Since I’m her only daughter, my mother decided to force me into her dancer dreams and basically live through me. I missed much school for out of state dance competitions and abroad summer boarding schools, I even did online school for middle school and my first three years of high school online because of the competitions and programs I was enrolled in. Dance is all I know and I love the sport with everything within me as I dedicated my entire life to it, but it’s not my passion in life. I’ve always wanted to become a lawyer. My uncle is a lawyer and everything about the lawyer life style is what I’m interested in becoming. My mother? Can’t hear it. She’s helped me apply to many dance universities around the world and I even got accepted into a few extremely exclusive schools, but all I want to do is study criminal justice and become a lawyer. By the grace of god I got my mother to allow me to return to a performing arts school for my senior year of high school which I’m currently starting in the fall and I want to speak to my counselor about going to a college within criminal justice. I don’t plan on telling me my mother which school I choose to apply to apply to and will pretend to allow her to believe I’m attending a dance university, then tell her the truth when it’s too late for her to do anything.I have three older brothers that got to choose their majors so why can’t I?

AITA For presenting an ‘ultimatum’ to a friend for him to be around more?	"The title makes it sound worse than I believe it is, but obviously I’m not certain.Background: My friend Liam is the sort of glue that holds our group together. Everyone likes him and whenever he’s around, it’s a party. I kind of wish I was that person but you gotta play the hand you’re dealt. Anyways Liam has been seriously on and off for the past month. Like, where he would be around daily has now reduced to twice a month.I know this is a problem because my other friends have expressed the same thing. We want him around, he’s fun to be with, and we all just don’t vibe the way we do when he’s around. I’ve tried to find out what the problem is if there is any, and I can’t seem to see anything out of the ordinary out of his own life, so from what I can tell he’s just drifting away.If that’s the case, it’s not my position to stop him. But I wanted to make it known that if he doesn’t invest more time into our group of friends, there might soon come a time where he’s not considered in the group anymore. And I really hated saying that to him because it sounds so accusatory, as if he has some responsibility or something. Like, it’s arduous where it’s supposed to be fun. I don’t know if I’m being fair or not in doing this.TLDR: Friend appeared to be drifting away, so I presented him with the ultimatum that either he invests more time in our friends group or he might not even be in the group anymore soon."

I haven't seen my family or friends in about a year and we finally got all the necessary paperwork done for my green card and I can finally travel outside of the US again.   I started planning a trip next month for two and a half weeks back to my hometown to see all my friends and family and I wasn't sure wether I wanted him to come or not. On one hand, I'd miss him a lot and want him to see my friends and family and on the other I want a trip by myself as I've been feeling overwhelmed lately and just want some alone time with friends and family. I expressed my feelings to him and was very open about how I felt about him coming and I asked for his input and if I was being selfish etc. He said I can do what I want and he's just happy for me that i'm finally able to go back home. But he also is telling me he wants to come and visit everyone and now I don't know what to do.  I wanted some alone time away from him because I feel overwhelmed and sometimes smothered. He's a great guy and is encouraging me to make new friends here and get out more, but it's been difficult for me to start from scratch especially since I've never lived anywhere else in my life. There's nothing I would do back home that I wouldn't also do with him and I have nothing to hide from him, but lately I just want some time apart with my friends and family just one on one. I haven't had the best relationship with my mother and I've wanted to work on that for years and I just want a bit of girl time with my friends.

WIBTA if I don't tell my mom I can't have kids	"This obviously needs some extra clarification. I'm a 22 y/o gay man, graduating from college pretty soon. I've never expressed any interest in having kids, and I'm genuinely settled on never having any.I recently got a sperm count done because I was considering donating sperm. My mom has expressed that she would want to be informed if I ever did a sperm donation, and I was about to call her and talk about it when my count came back. I'd expected to be okay, it's not like sterility runs in my family (ha), but instead I'm totally dry. Not a single sperm cell. I was a little concerned because I was hoping for that money, but that's obviously not the end of the world. I did go through a period of worry, anger and sadness, because it did make me feel like... less than a full man. I've dealt with those feelings, but now, it's something I just... don't want to tell my mom about. I never planned on having kids anyway, so it doesn't really change anything, and it's not like I was about to accidentally get someone pregnant either. I mentioned my intention to not say anything in passing to my roommate, whose been a help to me as he is actually also sterile. He argued, mostly for the sake of argument, rather than actually fully believing his argument, that by not telling my mom that I actually cannot have kids, I'm lying by ommission, and also possibly setting my younger brother up for a nasty surprise if it is in some way a genetic thing. He argued that I wouldn't hide any other disease from her, which is accurate. But this feels more personal and also less impactful. I'm not sure... AITA?"

My friends aren’t ) The woman gave me a dirty look and laughed, it made me feel kind of embarrassed and awkward. It caused me to well with tears a bit but I wasn’t crying. Then one of my friends asked, quite loudly if I was upset. Which caused some tears to fall.I said no I just felt a bit embarrassed. They laughed slightly and I politely said I’m going to the toilet. (So I could calm down and not embarrass myself further)I came back 5 minutes later and we went to dinner, at dinner the same friend told me I ruined their experience at the store because I was crying.

The small restaurant I work for appears to not being paying me in full (Idaho)	"I am a server at a small restaurant. Its a higher end affair so the tips are pretty good. I’ve been working for about a year and a half and was promoted to manager at the end of March 2019.  I was working about 30 hours a week at $4 per hour plus tips. Now my contract included the following pay structure. $8 per hour plus tips $300 a month for 15 hours of social media management Up to 20 hours per week at $20 per hour for management dutiesA monthly bonus of 25% of food and labor savings  Over the past month the owners couldn’t make payroll, so they told me I would get zero management hours for the month, even though I still had the responsibilities, and tasks that were roughly 20 hours a week of work. They also canceled mine and coworkers shifts so they could work and didn’t need to pay them the hourly wage. I understand they can probably cut shifts, but can they just decide not to pay me for management hours if that’s what I’m doing? I also dug into my data and found that I was eligible for the bonus 4 times to date, and have been paid $200 twice. Which is peculiar because I don’t see how the savings would be the exact same both months and come out to a nice round number. They dont want to give me access to the data to determine this. I think because they don’t actually know how to calculate it. Are they obligated to give me the data?

[USA][Ohio] My immigrant husband recently learned from the Social Security Administration that his first name is formatted differently on his SS card v. the SS database. SSA says this error is impossible bc the name on the SS card is printed DIRECTLY from the database and not typed by a human.	"My husband’s birth country doesn’t have middle names, so people often have multiple first names.

He immigrated last summer. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (including his Lawful Permanent Residence/Green Card) and the Ohio BMV have him registered asFirst name: Jean PaulSurname: NoirWhen he applied for his Social Security Number last fall, when providing the documents, we made it clear that “Jean Paul” *with a space* was his first name. **The social security card was correctly printed as, “JEAN  PAUL  NOIR.”** The Social Security Administration even addressed the envelope to Jean Paul Noir.However, by coincidence we recently learned from an agent at the SSA that he is listed as “**JeanPaul** Noir” in the Social Security database. The SSA claims this discrepancy between SS Card and SS database is not possible and they have been unhelpful in answering our questions. **Our primary questions:**&gt;Who can we contact to resolve this issue?&gt;Is it possible that the SS database contains the space between the first names but doesn’t input it on the computer screen?&gt;Will this discrepancy affect his background checks with credit companies and potential employers, etc.?

Roommate Refuses to Pay Rent	"I live with two other roommates as of right now.  One is my good friend and always pays full on and right on time.

Apartment is not what was promised	"We (22F &amp; 25M) just arrived to our apartment for the first time and it’s not so great. We have toured the neighboring apartment, and then rented the one next door once it became available. Not only did we find an old pair of contact lenses on the bedroom floor, but half a Trojan condom wrapper in the corner and a sock in the heater. Neither of the two windows open, despite the landlord promising we could easily install an AC unit. The carpet is very dirty, it strongly smells of cat piss (we believe it’s coming from the vents), and around the base of each wall is grime. There are thumbtacks still in the walls and scattered in the cabinets. There are dead bugs and occupied spider webs on the kitchen floor. Cat hair is piled into each corner of the room. In the fridge, several dark, easily removable stains are present, as well as a few strands of hair (???). I took pictures of everything we found, to be safe. Is there some course of action we can take to either lower the rent or at least get the landlord to do something about the scent? Is there anything we can do about this, or are we stuck fixing it ourselves?Edit: We live in Salt Lake City, Utah"	Did you do a walk-through with the landlord before signing?	cawjgx	legaladvice	-1	-1
How to file Adverse Possession in MO	"Sorry for long.So in 2008 I lost my job lost my apartment and quickly lost my savings. After a couple months living in my car I decided the summer heat was too much and started sleeping/hanging out in one of the many many abandoned houses in my city. I've been here since and while I always heard others talk about squatters rights I never looked into it until recently and found out in MO that it only takes 10 years. I hit that mark in about 2 months assuming the cops don't kick me out before then and was wondering about how to file a claim for the title, as I've come to view this place as home. Plus its saved me a lot of money living here that I've been able to pay off all my collections, medical bills and other loans which I never thought I could do. I tried googling laws, but I can barely understand half the words they use on Nolo and Findlaw etc. Would I qualify for adverse possession? The law says 10 years ""open possession"". The first 6-9 months I stayed stealth, only went in and out the back door, parked my car down the street, never had any light sources at night etc. But since then I've acted like it was mine. I mow the lawn, replaced appliances and stuff inside, built a new staircase to the front door, go to neighborhood barbecues and park in the driveway. I never hooked up utilities as I didn't want to flag the possible owners or authorities, but otherwise it should be obvious someone is living there.How do I prove how long I've been there? I have photos of myself and friends hanging out in the yard or in the house from years ago, is that proof enough? Am I opening myself up to criminal charges? I've changed locks, torn out old broken appliances, forged documents so I could get mail there etc. I don't want to risk getting arrested and losing my job and having to start over again.How expensive or lengthy of a process would it actually be? The house was probably only worth 10k or 20k when I moved in and even with the work I've done can't be worth more than 40k now based on looking at Zillow. Would the corporation that owns it bother fighting for such a cheap piece of property?Thanks all."

(TX) Child Custody and Father	"Throwaway for reasons. Basically, my (soon to be) ex husband and I had an open relationship and I had a reliable “boyfriend” while my husband had various “girlfriends”. At one point he made me choose between him and my boyfriend and I chose the boyfriend because he treated me better, treated our four kids better, and was actually responsible. Once I made my choice my ex moved out of state with one of his girlfriends and started sending $20/week for child support. Fast forward a few months, I have a new home with my now fiancé and the children and he has now moved back, now he’s living with/open relationship with a stripper who happens to be a Satanist. He only wants to see the children when his mother visits and he doesn’t send child support at all. His living conditions make me want to vomit (very unclean and he doesn’t have a bed for the children). I have videos of him PLAYING with knives in front of our youngest, he started smoking weed again (not bad but our children have said he smells “funny” and “smokes smelly things,” he claims he has a demon inside of him, and I have a lot of evidence of him being unfit in general. Whenever the kids visit him, they come back unruly and won’t listen to my fiancé at all, and our oldest is especially a handful, as she was the closest to her father. With him not having safe conditions, his girlfriend being what she is, not helping with any support at all (he claims my fiancé should pay because he is a manager at Walmart) and his claim to have a demon in him, would I be accused of alienation if I don’t allow him to have visitation until the court decides themselves? Also what else can I do? I document everything he says, including the times he’s asked to see the kids and just doesn’t show up (or if he does). I would like to know just what I can do to keep my children safe, and is there a possibility to get his rights terminated or get him a psychiatric evaluation? I believe he is a danger to the children but I don’t want to lose them because I didn’t allow visitation. He claims he wants to get full custody, but is that at all possible for him to get?"

Sewage backing up in my Apartment.	"This is in the US in Iowa. This problem started 6 months ago. The first incident happened while I was asleep. At about 10 pm I was awoken by a smell coming from my apartment. I went to check it out and noticed that the hall next to my floor was soaked, that my restroom was soaked, and that my closet was soaked. My kitchen sink, my bathroom tube, and the sump next to my water heater all had black stuff coming out of those drains. I immediately informed maintenance and the apartment management and they set someone to tare out some of the subflooring, dry the flooring, and the next day had someone shop-vac the affected areas. They also sent someone to do ""additional preventative maintenance."" Now today I am living with the same flooring, and the same sewage filled walls. (Ok not filled but some parts are black where it was white).Today the same thing happened, but to a much lesser extent. (Black stuff only came from the sump next to my bedroom). This time they only put a snake down in the sump and are going to only shop-vac it.What are my legal rights in this case? What should I expect from my landlord in this case? Could I get charged these damages that is beyond my control if they are not addressed immediately (ei the black walls and discolored flooring)? And if so what should I do?I have evidence in a form of personal memo, maintenance reports, and pictures from this incident, as well as other incidents.

Fudge the paperwork.  Getting caught concerns me;  but if the prothonotary is able to look up my marriage record, why would they need me to answer in the first place? Also, wouldn't they be able to also see divorce records?Downside here is I really don't want to lie, aside from possible legal consequences.  I'm not trying to commit bigamy, it's a legal marriage, but...  Paperwork.C. Take time off work, several days to fly to San Diego and try to get my records in person.Downside: hundreds of dollars, time lost at work, etc.I'm kind of at an impasse and would greatly appreciate advice from people who know about Pennsylvania marriage law.

To make a long story short, in the split it has come out that my soon to be ex wife’s child is not mine biologically. I realize that the circumstances (her lying about going through with the insemination versus lying about an affair) are somewhat different from the average, but the fact of the matter is that this child is not mine. I know that legally I will be facing a massively uphill battle in recouping my past costs, so going forward I will only be seeking removal of my name from the birth certificate and a stop to any further costs (child support, college tuition, etc.)How do I prepare for this? What do I need to know? Any relevant cases I can read up on? Is there a point at which I could cite emotional damages? Is it really fruitless (as first attorney called it) to consider the pursuit of fraud charges against my ex?Thanks in advance.

Admitted to hospital and found out I'm enrolled in MediCal in addition to having an exchange plan. MediCal told me I broke the law. Please help me resolve this.	"Hi Reddit. I was admitted to hospital through the emergency room last week. This week I am still inpatient but well enough to have called the hospital billing department. They told me I have MediCal listed as a secondary insurance.I had no idea I am enrolled in MediCal as I pay privately for a plan through Covered California. I called MediCal (Care LA) and they informed me that it is illegal to be enrolled in MediCal and also have a private insurance plan.I believe my husband probably enrolled me when he enrolled himself last year and just never mentioned it. At the moment I am not able to speak with him about this issue to confirm and I need to solve this problem fast, but I called around a lot this morning and frankly I have no idea what to do to resolve this besides disenroll from MediCal, which I will be doing.Any information is helpful. Is this illegal? What law was broken? If I didn't use my MediCal benefits, can I just disenroll and not face any penalty? If I am facing a penalty what would it be? Where can I get more information about this issue in general?This has been such a stressful week and having this problem heaped on has only made it exponentially worse. Thank you so much to anyone who replies with any info that can point me in the direction of getting this issue resolved."

BF hit by vehicle while on bicycle (AZ)	"Just wanted to get some advice on that matter. My boyfriend was on hit on the way to work and hit by vehicle running a red light. He was injured with a broken collar bone (luckily it wasn’t worse..) The officer cited my bf being at fault (civil citation), and charged him with failure to signal..? the car went off with no citation. Was also speeding, the officer said he was going 48 and we went back to the intersection.. the speed limit posted their is 35 since it’s near a school. There is traffic camera all posted in the intersection from what I can see. Was that right?According to the officer the driver said my bf just turned suddenly left in the road. My bf waited for the light to turn red on the sidewalk next to the light then went through an unmarked crosswalk riding his bike through it. He did have a bright led light on hit bike and a red one in the back of it as well. My bf did end up going unconscious so he wasn’t able to say what happened right after since he was still confused from it while we were at the hospital.. Should we get a lawyer for this and try fighting it? My bf is unable to work for 10 wks and we now have to do physical therapy too, he’s on a leave of absence for the moment.

roommate is keeping me hostage on lease	"My roommate bought a grand piano which it states on the lease that we cannot have and turned the apartment into her own music studio without any permission.I decided this was not the right place for me to live anymore and since I was month to month I called the leasing office and they had me put in my 30 days notice. I gave my notice on September 22nd, this gave my roommate over a month to find a replacement (leaving date is October 31st). I paid October rent in full and utilities even though I was not staying the entire month. one week before leaving my roommate still had not found someone and refused to sign the release addendum that would remove me from the lease, she had a self declared condition that she wanted the incoming person to be signed on at the same time this is signed. I informed the leasing office and the landlord about this condition and they all said to go with it. She soon found someone, but the leasing office has taken over 2 weeks to even process the application.  It is now November 1st, none of my belongings are in the apartment, and the keys have been handed over to my former roommate.

(FL) Custody/Time Sharing Issue Regarding Child Visitation	"So I'm just trying to figure out the best course of action regarding visitation for my girlfriend's three year old child  and the visitation set forth between biological father. My girlfriend hasn't gone to court but between lawyers, there was a visitation arrangement set forth regarding the child a few months ago and they've been following it completely. The problem is that he didn't mention getting engaged, married, and leaving for the military all in the same week (married two days ago, leaving SOMETIME this next week). This complicates things as we're anticipating that he'll want us to follow the schedule with the new step-mom and him become non-existent in seeing the child for the next year due to training and not being in town anymore. We don't want to make any bad decisions and we don't have the money to get a lawyer just yet as this was sprung on us out of nowhere. Would my girlfriend, once the father is gone, be in violation of the order by not releasing the child to the step-mother?

Is a rental contract that contradicts state law still legally binding?	"I’m a student living in an apartment building. Our apartment has a cockroach infestation. Per Virginia law, I contacted my landlord after making my best efforts to solve the issue myself. According to Virginia law (specifically the VRLTA) it is the responsibility of the landlord to maintain habitable living conditions. I checked with my school’s office of student living and the man I talked to confirmed that in his understanding, it is the financial responsibility of the landlord to provide pest services if the tenant is not at fault. The problem is, there is a section in my lease that says all pest control services will be charged to the tenant. This contradicts the earlier part of the lease that says that the landlord will follow all duties outlined in the VRLTA. I can’t afford the charges, and furthermore I don’t think I should have to pay them. I had to harass my landlord into even sending me an invoice/proof that the services occurred and they sent it in a file format that I can’t figure out how to open (MIME?).

It may sound silly, but it's important to me.

Reported to the HOA for barbell training in my garage	"Las Vegas, NV - USAI live in a 3 bedroom rental home in Vegas, my garage connects to my neighbor's garage, and we share a driveway with 2 other homes on the other side (4 homes total in 1 driveway).3x a week I enjoy barbell training in my garage (squats, bench, deadlifts) and my sessions last 45-60 minutes at the most. I always make sure to lift around 11am ending at 12pm, and the latest I've trained would be 3-4pm, never at night to disturb anyone.When I train I enjoy leaving the garage open for fresh air and natural lighting. I may play music on a small music box with the volume at a respectable level, never blasting.The neighbor's house on my side that connects with my garage is an old work friend from years ago that has no trouble with me lifting (and has young kids that nap). My neighbor directly across from me is very friendly as well and often says hello and chats with me.The neighbor diagonally across from me however always gives me dirty looks and recently reported me to the HOA saying I've converted my garage into a weight room, when I still use my garage for storing my car and other things, I just happen to also use a small part of it to train in.The violation letter I received basically says the garage has to be used for storing cars and can't be converted into a recreational or living space. I use my garage primarily for storing my car, my trash cans, and various other things, but I do have a small area for my squat rack and workouts which are only 3x a week less than an hour.After I got the email about this I started lifting with my garage door closed which made me really unhappy because I lose all the sunlight and fresh air, and I wasn't bothering anyone this guy is being petty. To add salt to the wound, this asshat neighbor started putting his trash can in front of my house on purpose. Not once did he do it prior to reporting me, always put it on his side of the shared driveway, now it's always smack dab in front of my house and he does it intentionally to frustrate me.Since the primary function of my garage is to store the car and other various things, am I legally allowed to workout in my garage 3x a week, or does the HOA and my douchebag neighbor have the power to tell me what I can or can't do in my own garage?"	how does he know what you’re doing in there now?	a71g5p	legaladvice	-1	-1

He got stern because her mother left a text ""I'm keeping her this weekend"" so he asked what as sup, and no answer, he kept trying and no answer. He called and texted his daughter to no answer.. So her left a message on her phone (that apparently made her cry, according to her mother) ""it's your dad, I bought you this phone to get a hold of you not to play games, call me back."" so that unleashed a slew of text messages from the ex girlfriend.

"(FL, US) Labor laws questions(2 of them)"	"Hello! Thanks for taking the time to read the following long post and for any advice that you can give. I have reviewed the page's wiki and determined that my question was not answered. I will apologize if I missed it.I am researching the labor laws of Florida based on my mother's situation. She currently works for a company as an hourly wage worker. She typically works more than 40 hours per week and is compensated for the overtime in accordance with the FLSA at 1.5x her hourly rate. However, it has come to my attention that she has worked more than 40 hours in a week, then took some hours of Paid Time Off(PTO) at the end of the week. Rather than take those PTO hours from her accrued bank of hours, they deducted it from her overtime hours worked in that week. My first question is the legality of this. My understanding is that her PTO is paid at straight time and, as previously mentioned, overtime is at 1.5x. The disparity here means she is losing money by trying to take vacation hours in a week that she works more than 40 hours. This has occurred on more than one occasion(she has worked with the company for 4 years).The next question is regarding hourly wage rates and full-time vs part-time positions. As I said, my mother has worked for this company for 4 years in full-time capacity. Recently, they have hired a new employee to do the same job, but part-time. The new employee's hiring rate was $12.00 per hour. My mother, after 4 years, is being paid at $10.50 per hour. The only additional information i have about the other employee is that they are a woman as well, so gender discrimination is not a concern. I am unsure if any other bias can be taken into consideration without speaking with my mom further. So, for this question i'd like to determine the legality of it based on a non-biased position. I would like to state that my mom has brought this up to her manager who stated that ""She gets paid more because she is part-time.""I apologize ahead of time if anything is unclear and i'd be more than happy to provide any amplifying information that is needed. Any details that I do not know I will request from my mother, so replies may be delayed as I get the information needed. Thanks again!"

Auto dealer contacts me every few months after I have told them not to call me again	"Here is a bit of the backstory. I bought a brand new car in 2011. The next day on my drive home from work I noticed a dent in the hood. It looked like a manufacturing defect and I brought it into the dealer within 48hours of purchasing it. The sales man said there was nothing they could do as did the sales manages and service manager. One of the managers actually asked if I had pissed someone off and they hit my hood with a mallet! The damage was minor and looked as if it was done before the vehicle was painted. I left the dealer frustrated and told them I wouldn't do any more business with them again. About 4 years ago I started receiving phone calls from them telling me they would like me to upgrade or they have someone interested in my car and I told them the above story, and that I would never do business with them again. I was always polite but firm and asked them not to call me anymore. But still, every 3-6 months I get a call from them with the same story. Today, I snapped at the poor woman on the phone. She said she is sorry for the service I received and will make sure I don't get called again. But the last 6 people I've talked to have said the same thing.

Work got a subpoena to give video footage of ATM transactions a person made.	"Hi there, we got a subpoena from the Utah Third District Court at a 7-11 to produce video footage of listed dates and times that a certain individual used the ATM to do I assume illegal or fraudulent transactions. The problem is, we do not have a camera directly facing the ATM, only the ATM itself has a camera on it but it is a third party that has the ATM there, not 7-11 itself. We left a voicemail at the number listed on the subpoena that we cannot produce these videos, but we gave them the number of the ATM company that is on the ATM and our own phone number to get back to us. I’m just wondering what we can expect from here, we do have video footage of the individual going to the ATM, but not of them at the ATM carrying out a transaction. We also don’t know if we should contact the ATM company and tell them about the subpoena. Thanks."

God I’m really attached to the car too.	"I [20 F] was recently, Saturday, in a car accident where I was driving down the street and a older woman waiting to exit from a parking lot pulled out and hit me.  I live in Maine and this took place in Lewiston. There was a police report done and I reported the accident to my insurance via the 24/7 line after finishing with the officer. The next morning I was feeling sore in a few areas. After speaking with my insurance Monday, to check on the claim and do the I’ve got an ouchie thing, I found out that I am able to get treatment up to a certain $ amount and that the woman is trying to pin the accident on me. I was checked out Tuesday and the injury is minor. Now, Thursday, my insurance has called to update me and apparently the insurance info the other driver has provided is false and her claimed insurance company has never heard of her. I’ve also been told she keeps calling MY insurance company trying to make a claim against me for the accident. My car, which has been sitting in my yard since the accident, only has liability on it so my insurance can’t do anything to help fix it. Should I be preparing to sue?"

Insurance company is refusing to pay out on accident.	"A few weeks ago my wife was in a car accident that totaled our van, because someone pulled out in front of her.

Georgia moldy rental and lovely landlord.	"Just wondering what counts as uninhabitable in Georgia.  I live in a very small cabin that is all I can afford.

Bamboo growing onto my property (AL)	We live in 3+ acres in Alabama and one of our neighbors is a vacant plot.  The previous owners of the property planted bamboo near our shared property line and it is now growing on our property.  Our biggest fear is the bamboo will damage our pool area but also it takes a lot of care to continually remove the bamboo from our property.  Installing a containment system appears to cost somewhere in the $1-5k range (depending on the effectiveness).  The bamboo stalks on their property are over 15 ft tall and it is growing at a rapid rate (currently taking up maybe 1/8th acre).  Do we have any recourse in forcing the neighbors to prevent the invasive species from growing onto our property?  Do we have any right to remove the bamboo on their property (I’m pretty sure no based on all the tree posts I’ve read here)? Most importantly what specialization of lawyer will be most effective in helping us?Thanks in advance for your responses!	Do you know who owns that plot of land now?	91t6g2	legaladvice	-1	-1
Brother killed in crash after being followed by police from bar	"My brother (24) died today in Louisiana 3 days after being followed from a bar and wrecking in a, thankfully, single car accident. The story from the police is that a call was made from the bar saying he was rowdy, and somehow the next thing is my brother is leaving the bar and an officer is approaching him with lights and sirens. Officer says he followed him from the bar, and when my brother began speeding and driving erratically in response to being followed with lights and sirens he backed off. He says he rounded a corner and my brother had wrecked at high speed. This was fairly brief as the bar is pretty close to the crash site. Witnesses heard sirens up until the crash, no backing off. Home security camera on block before wreck shows cop still chasing with lights. They took a significant time to get to him after the crash as they waited for a total of 9 cars to surround him. He was essentially dead when they got to him. He never responded and was brain dead on arrival.We're just trying to piece the story together because no one called us, not even the police. ER workers eventually called us. 1. No charges were made that we're aware of. Is that weird? 2. I know entrapment isn't allowed, but are police allowed to follow someone from the bar if the bar called the police to say they were being rowdy? 3. He said he backed off when he realized my brother was driving like crazy due to being chased. He obviously didn't, does law require that he pull back (doesn't seem likely, maybe he just lied for the hell of it).4. What rights do we have: can we get dash cams, body cams, ambulance records, police records without a lawyer? 5. I know he messed up, and no amount of info will bring him back. I'm just seeking info for closure."	"He obviously didn't, does law require that he pull back?"	br2jxs	legaladvice	-1	-1
Got in an accident immediately after purchasing insurance. Need advice	"I just purchased comprehensive auto insurance online for a relatively new, previously uninsured vehicle. The insurance was purchased at 8:30 pm on August 30th. I got in an accident at around midnight  that same evening. Unbelievable, I know, but the information is all time stamped (credit card, emails, etc.). As I began exchange information at the accident I was concerned to realize that the effective date at the bottom of my card was September 1st. I thought the insurance was active upon purchase, though I may have simply made an error or misunderstood when I finalized the purchase. I wouldn’t have been driving had I known my insurance wouldn’t be active for another 24-30 hrs.The accident was largely mutual cause, it was pouring rain, and we didn’t see each other. Cop that showed up hardly did anything so that wasn’t helpful. Anyway, what I’m wondering is if there’s any chance USAA will be understanding or if they’ll stiff arm me, and I’ll lose $10,000 on my car, or worse, be sued or have my license suspended or something. I’m active duty, incredibly busy, and don’t have a lot of savings or assets. Also, I have an Idaho license and this occurred in Texas."	Which state are you in?	cyap44	legaladvice	-1	-1
(USA) (MA/ME) My wife’s uncle is trying to illegally block us from using a family house this summer. Will my MIL’s demand letter help?	"Hey legaladvice, I wrote [this formal demand](https://imgur.com/gallery/FBeFIxj) for my mother-in-law. Basically, what has been going on is her and her brother both live in MA and are are the two appointed co-trustees for their late father’s family trust that he set up. The trust consists of a lake house in Maine and an account that started at ~$115K in 2002 and now has ~$90K. The way the trust is written, both co-trustees need to agree to any expenses or changes, but her brother has been acting without regard to her or their late father’s wishes. First, he lost about $15K in bad investments that she never consented to back in 2005-2007. Last year he sent out letters asking for advice to supplement the trust fund, then 2 weeks later sent out letters saying he’d come to the conclusion that everybody would need to pay $500 per week to stay there (except him or his daughter because of “all they do” of course lmao). Well MIL promptly called him and said that no, nobody in the family will be charged a fee to use the family vacation house, the funds in the account are sufficient for the time being, and they’ll discuss a plan of action if and when it becomes necessary. He grumbled and said OK. Now my wife and I scheduled 3 separate weeks there this summer months ago, the first of which begins this Sat 6/1/19. On this last Friday we got a knock on the door with a certified letter from him. It said he had changed the locks and nobody was allowed there unless we paid $1500 for last summer and $1500 up front for this summer. We think he did this very intentionally as Monday was a holiday and we’d have no way to figure anything out in 4 short days. I drafted this [this “formal demand”](https://imgur.com/gallery/FBeFIxj) for my MIL and we intend to mail it out with new keys to everyone authorized to use the house, go there anyway, and change the locks back to a shared key. My question is, will bringing this document in addition to copies of the will, the trust agreement, and a signed and notarized letter from MIL that we are allowed to be there protect us in the **VERY LIKELY** event he shows up or sends his daughter and tries to have us removed/arrested for trespassing?"

Potential illegal kickback	"Edit: This is in PennsylvaniaTo make a long story short, I've recently been hired as a business manager for a Pharmacy.  Since accepting the position, I've learned of the owner discounting a copay on a regular basis for at least one patient since 2016.There are records of a discounted sale on the copay, and also of a gift certificate being created for the customer without being paid for as they stand at the register, and given to the customer to use towards the prescription.The reason for the discounting, as is written in the patients notes, is that the pharmacy gets reimbursed more for the generic of the prescription than the brand. However, the generic is more expensive for the patient than the brand, so the copay is being worked in a way to make it so the patient isn't paying anymore than they normally would. I did some digging online and, by my understandi g, found that adjustment or waiving of a copay on a regular basis is considered an illegal kickback by the OIG.I'm not sure if this has been done with any other patients, as I'm still new to the company, but I was curious as to whether or not this should be something I consider becoming a whistleblower for.Any help is appreciated!"

[MA] Ambiguous Compensation Wording in Internship Agreement	"I am a college student interning at a small startup (&lt; 20 people) in the Boston area this summer. In May, I signed an agreement with the dates of the internship, some of the responsibilities, and the compensation details. Specifically, there was a paragraph that read: ""If you accept this offer, you will begin your internship with the Company on \[start date\], which is expected to end on \[end date\]. You will also receive a salary of $\[XYZ\].""Now, I was quite pleased with $\[XYZ\] as it was quite generous and some of the friends I showed the contract to agreed. As such, I didn't bother to negotiate. Two days ago, I received my first pay check and it was apparent that there was a misunderstanding. I got paid about 1/5th of what I expected, and when I did the math, it was clear that they extrapolated my pay to an annual salary--that is, I would receive 10/52 \* $\[XYZ\] for my 10-week internship. And while this new amount is above minimum wage, it's not at all competitive given the field and location, so am considering bringing up the misunderstanding and trying to renegotiate.  Do I have any sort of legal leverage to renegotiate my salary given the ambiguity of wording and misunderstanding? Is there any world where I am entitled to the full amount, $\[XYZ\]?"

Slumlord files eviction	"I live in georgia, us.  I moved in on the last day of school (early june), I have paid my rent regularly, but this landlord has been a joke as far as repairs.

[TX] Dry Cleaners destroyed two expensive sweaters and refuse to reimburse me for the full value of them. I want to sue in small claims court.	"Among several other items, I dropped off two wool sweaters to my dry cleaner last week and picked them up Friday. I just noticed yesterday that they obviously washed the wool sweaters, rather than dry cleaning them. For those that don't know, washing wool makes it shrink *significantly* -- to the point that I can't even fit them both anymore. They're useless to me, which is quite unfortunate because I spent ~$100 each for them. I don't make very much money, so this is not at all a trivial amount to me. I know $200 may seem like pocket change to some, but it's a significant amount to me. There is no question that they were supposed to be dry cleaned and not washed, and this was not a case of miscommunication. The reason I know this for a fact is because this cleaners has a special on shirts, where if you drop off at least $10 worth of dry cleaning, they knock 50 cents off each shirt. I almost always do this promo and it's worked perfectly for me for over a year now. It is very specifically dry cleaning, because even if I dropped off 30 shirts, that wouldn't qualify for the promo, as shirts are laundered and not dry cleaned. There is a very big distinction between the two, and they clearly are at fault without question.  I called the cleaners this morning and they are refusing to reimburse me for the value of the sweaters (which were in flawless condition). I want to take them to small claims court and sue for the value of the sweaters and all court/legal costs. Do I have a viable case? I do not have proof of purchase of these sweaters, as I purchased them several months ago and have since discarded the receipt. Is this an issue? Are there other obstacles that will prevent me from having a good case against them? I don't view this as a frivolous case and I certainly am not trying to blow this out of proportion. I just want to be able to buy the sweaters again, and it shouldn't be at my expense because of their negligence. What's my best course of action?"

Just Given Notice to Vacate	"Hi, I've been renting a house in Western NY for the past two years and at the end of the summer the landlord put the house up for sale.  In September they transitioned me to month-to-month lease.  This past week I was notified that the house was sold and new owner moving in upstairs.  Yesterday, 10/30/18, I was given a ""30 day notice to quit/vacate"".

Told me to stop on the microphone and proceeded to talk with me. I refused the breathalyzer and opted for the blood test. Uber came as I was being arrested and they could have mentioned it in the report. No clue on the tow truck. I was booked and released later on $2500 bail for misdemeanor DUI.

How To Get Rid Of Dangerous Roommate	"Having roommate issues in Nashville Tennessee. Long story short, had a new roommate move in at the beginning of June. It just hasn't worked out in any way. He comes home at 4am with friends and wants to put on music and drink and stuff. He said when he moved on he had a stable job and he had pay stubs to prove it, but since he's moved in he's skipped work more times than he's gone. He moved in with next to nothing. He had clothes and a futon mattress. Because of this, he's had to use all my things in the kitchen and I said it's alright if he uses them, but they need to be cleaned when he's done with it and he'll just leave my cookware in the sink for days at a time. He and his friends trash the yard daily, he invites people with kids over and they leave the kids to watch tv while they go get high out back. He's done cocaine more days than he hasn't since he's moved in.

"[Connecticut] Owner sold house I live in, have three weeks until closing and no where to go"	"I rent a room in a house from a lady who never told me a month ago that I had several months to find a place because she was selling her house. Now I find out today (July 8) that she has a buyer and the closing is taking place on July 31'st, and I have no where to go. I am recovering from cancer surgery and also just had my gall bladder out recently. The reason that I rent like this is because of my health, I can't make a lot of money, and it's not like I can just find a place. There is no way I can do this all in three weeks. Do the new owners have the right to throw me out of the house or do they have to go through regular eviction proceedings? This is in Connecticut."

Insurance is going after my aunt who sold me a car that I drove and got into an accident on.	"So recently I got myself into a car accident late night with the car being still own by my aunt, The car needed insurance, California tags for this year as well as a ownership title swap from my aunts to my name. The vehicle was brought last year of January from Washington with my last of my savings as I needed it to commute to work, once I manage to make the round trip to and back home I noticed the car engine would loss oil, after a month with car the engine block blew and had it parked next to sisters parking lot which she wasn’t happy about for the reason that I did not reside there,  I stayed with a friend of mine. After a couple months of saving I got enough to order a new engine which we put on the car, which was good timing because my friend moved in with pregnant girlfriend and I had to go. At this point I been sleeping in my car while working and saving to get the car up to date with everything, so it was was pouring rain which cause me workdays (Work in agriculture/labor) and I was running low on cash and got a call from an contractor that remodels homes and was offering me a couple weeks of work that would put me back on track. This was a Sunday, he said that he would be needing the next day so I got on the road and was driving up North towards Santa Clara, Ca. On my way up is where I got myself into the accident, I rear ended someone’s car and while at the sense Sheriff started asking me questions like the proper documents and such which I didn’t had, I told him about the work and that I was staying in my car. I was driven to the nearest greyhound where I called the contractor which made the trip to pick me and stay in his truck which help me a week of work to get a ticket home (my leg was hurting and so as my chest from the accident). I’m staying with this very nice older man who passes his day drinking and working everyday, he’s letting sleep on ground as I’m still recovering from the accident. Today I got a call informing my uncle he got a letter from the insurance from the person I rear ended. I want the blame to be put on me and not them. I don’t know where to ask.Sorry for my grammar and spelling."	Was the ownership completely changed over from your Aunt to you?	aniz0d	legaladvice	-1	-1

Girlfriend's PC started freezing and crashing randomly. We're not able to figure out what's wrong.

After some use  programs on the PC will stop responding or loading anything, the mouse turns into a loading wheel, and nothing becomes clickable and then the computer freezes up completely. She has to force shut down the computer.This is her description of the issue:*At random, two specific apps (steam and discord for sure, but also seemingly windows update as I last had issues with that giving me an error code like 800x800005? i think. when I checked it for funsies) will stop loading any new info as if they can't or aren't connected to the internet. though if i'm in a discord call it will stay up. from there, my PC degrades, either not allowing me to ctrl+alt+del or do anything other than open my start menu. it'll slowly get worse this way until it freezes. screen still shows, just the circular loading ring will keep going, and nothing will happen (HDD access light on case goes off, no sounds of use/stress on components.)*It also started doing this to her on startup too and it seems to reproduceable. She's tried reseating her RAM, her GPU, and has even done a fresh install of Windows by reformatting through installation media. The issue still persists. Any guidance will be much appreciated!"

Memory Question (32 GB of 3200 Mhz or 16 GB of 3600 Mhz for Ryzen 3800X)	"Hi all. A few months ago, I was beginning to buy new parts for the PC I was planning to build, and one of these parts was memory. I was considering to go with Ryzen 3000 (which I did), so I specifically chose the 3200 Mhz C16 option of the Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB 16 GB Kit, since that's what was recommended for Ryzen 2000. Obviously, I should have waited, since my motherboard at the time couldn't even support that speed (MSI B150M Bazooka), and when Ryzen 3000 released, the recommended speed was now 3600 Mhz. So, currently my PC has a Ryzen 7 3800X with the memory I listed above (Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB C16 at 3200 Mhz). So, here's my question.Along with gaming, I use my PC for video editing (and music production, but I don't think that's as memory intensive), and  I eventually want to upgrade to 32 GB of memory. So, should I buy another 16 GB of my current memory, or should I buy a kit of 3600 Mhz memory and then buy another 16 GB kit of it later on? I don't need to have 32 GB immediately. I honestly don't even know when I'm going to actually buy it, I just want to know which one I should choose when the times comes. The kit I'm looking at is the Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 16 GB C18 at 3600 Mhz.Thanks for any help!"	What motherboard do you have now?	doqxyj	pcmasterrace	-1	-1

The sadness when you no longer meet minimum specs	"Interesting situation for me....I built a PC a long time ago, and it's been great for years. I put a new GPU in a couple of years ago, and I've been running everything I wanted to at resolutions &amp; FPS I've been happy with.I have been considering/looking at an upgrade for a while, but it's one of those ""needs new mb, cpu and ram"" upgrades rather than just a single component.  I haven't been in a position to afford an upgrade, but it hasn't been a problem.Today I was looking at the BFV stuff and saw the minumum specs, and realised for the first time I couldn't make it (cpu-wise), and it was a weird feeling.All the advances in GPU tech over the last 5-10 years have been great and allowed me to keep up (4K aside) and play wonderful games with great visuals.  Upgraded to SSDs a few years ago and that again gave a sweet bump. It's like the human body....you can get a hip replacement, lung transplant, heart transplant, prosthetic limbs, a butt lift, but eventually the brain will simply get too old and you will die.It's easy of course for us to focus on the cutting edge of this lifestyle, with amazing builds and people pushing products beyond what they were originally thought capable of. However for a great majority of us it's about enjoying what we can with what we have - and we've been in a glorious era where SSDs and GPU compatibility has meant we can incrementally upgrade and continue to enjoy amazing games and online experiences with our friends without the stereotype of ""having to buy a whole new system every year"".For me, that time is at an end. I don't know if/when I'll be able to afford an upgrade, and of course it's only a single game impacted at this stage - I still have plenty to enjoy. I just thought it was a timely reminder of how for many of us we've been able to squeeze so much value out of our beloved rigs :)edit: maybe time to add a ""descending peasant"" flair or something :p"	"minimum specs dont really mean anything, what is the cpu?"	9743ih	pcmasterrace	-1	-1

The 120 FPS Joke isn’t Something we Should Laugh at	"Yes, I know, masterrace and all. Hear me out though. Everyone likes to joke about consoles on this sub, and it’s understandable. Consoles hitting 120 FPS is something we should be encouraging, not mocking. Here’s why. TV manufacturers go with the demand of what the consumer finds popular at the time. Sometimes this is a hit, sometimes it’s a miss. Consoles are something that can easily influence the market because of how common they become in a household. These things sell millions upon millions of units. HDR has been pushed recently and a big reason for it is console marketing. Now can you imagine TV manufacturers focusing on things like display port and Freesync? With consoles marketing these features they will become more common, and cheaper. That’s my take on it. Disagree if you’d like, that’s fine. I just want everyone’s gaming experience to be kick ass... and cheaper. My wallet hates me as it is."

Roth IRA vs stocks returns	To start off I’m a 22 year old male in college. In around March of 2017 I put $7200 in around 30 different stocks I believed were stable companies such as CAT AMAZON GOOGLE EXON NVDIA etc and as of right now have 8.980 so a return of about 1700. What are some recommendations should I leave the money in stocks and put all my salary in Roth IRA or sell stocks and put that in a Roth IRA or what. I know it’s a retirement savings account but if I will get more returns from stocks shouldn’t I just keep adding to stocks?

"Help on clearing debt, please! Details in post!"	"Hello, r/personalfinance. I am looking for advice on clearing some credit card debt and could really use your help. Thank you for reading through this post and providing advice. If you need any additional information, please don't hesitate to ask and I will be happy to provide it.I have a total credit card debt of $5,255.89 between two credit cards. Details are below.Chase Freedom Unlimited w/ 0% interest until March 2019: $4,404.64; minimum payment $55/month, however I contribute around $120/month to this account.Citi ThankYou Preferred w/ 0% interest until October 2018: $851.25; minimum payment is $25/month, however I contribute around $230/month to this account. I put a few bills (total of \~ $170/month) on this credit card, FYI. I have an Ally savings account with a balance of $6,934.08. I am unable to contribute to the savings account at all and it's been at a stand still (aside from the building interest). Every month after ALL of my bills including food + entertainment (which really isn't a lot as I had to cut down to pay down the debt), I have nearly $350 left over. I have been aggressively trying to pay this debt down, but I see no end and if my calculations serve me correct, I won't be able to pay them down in time that the 0% interest deal cuts off. I am wondering if I should put any of my savings towards paying down this debt, and maybe that way I can start to build up my savings again without worrying about the debt over my head? Do you have any advice on how I can do this? Please let me know if you have any questions, and please go easy on me.... I am still learning about finances. I know it's a sticky situation.

To sublease or not?	"I just signed a lease with a couple of friends in Chicago. But I'm going to relocate to Salt Lake City for a job with a nice pay bump, so I need to decide how to get out of my lease.I need your advice in figuring out whether or not to sublet my apartment. Subletting is allowed in the Chicago tenant ordinance, but managing a lease from Utah would be a bit of a pain if the sub-tenant refused to pay rent, caused issues with the roommates, or damaged the apartment. In addition to the headache, all these issues could incur financial costs as well.So my roommates have offered to have me instead pay them 50% of the cost of the rent for the whole year (about 5K) and they will agree to assume liability for the lease. We will of course get this in writing. I get a nice signing bonus with the new job, so I can definitely afford the 5K.So what are your thoughts here? 5K is a lot to pay, but it would certainly offer a lot of peace of mind, and the closure of moving on from the agreement."

Starting to panic under contract: Purchasing a home a bad idea for me?	"Ok here goes. I think I know the answer here but:I gross 70k a year.I was splitting rent (~$1400) with my girlfriend but unfortunately we've since broken up. So I've had to consider my next move. I don't want to stay here because well, memories. The market in Salt Lake City is pretty hot so purchase prices are relatively high. Renting is also pretty high and I'm tired of that game. So emotionally, buying sounds nice. I'm currently under contract for a house but I'm starting to panic a bit:-	297k purchase price-	15k down (borrowed, interest free from family)-	3.5% 30 year fixed.-	Seller is paying closing costs up to 5k-	payment works out to be $1543Debts are low-ish:-	$271 car payment-	$56 for iPhone upgrade programAssets are low too:-	$4400 in a traditional IRA that my last employer rolled over from a 401k. Not currently paying into it or any other retirement/401k. My living expenses are high because I’m not frugal and don’t watch my money super closely. (I know, I know) I’m trying to make changes to be more financially responsible going forward regardless of purchasing a home. I have great credit (820+) and always pay my bills. I’m just really good at living at the end of my means. Which I’m tired of.So my questions are these:-	Should I buy a house? I know it’s on the high end as a percentage of income but other expenses are low-ish.-	I work from home. Are there any tax or other benefits that could help me in this regard?-	How bad of an idea is borrowing a down payment?Let me know what other info might be helpful.

Mortgage Mystery	"My husband and I are currently living in my mother-in-law's second house to save up for our own home and become debt-free. We just pay utilities and look after the house while she stays at her other property in another state. She says that she wants to keep this house in the family and sell to us when we're ready... Which would be great, but our combined income at ages 28 and 29 is $125k and this house is now worth about $660k so we'd probably be house-poor for the rest of our lives. There's no way around that without seriously increasing our income, right? Anyway, my real question comes from seeing my mother-in-law's mortgage statement. The house was purchased in 1994 for $169k. The principal remaining on the most recent statement is $144k at 4% and the term is set until 2048. Does this mean she refinanced this year? Does this also mean she is facing significant financial hardship? I don't understand how one can own a house for that long and only effectively have paid $20k on it... I am very scared about purchasing a home and clearly don't know much about mortgages. Can anyone help me understand the situation? If she is facing hardship, we would be willing to pay the mortgage amount ($1300; instead of the $450 we currently pay for utilities) if it meant we could live here longer (super sweet house and a fantastic area and school for our daughter). Does that seem like a mutually beneficial proposal to make? Any advice is appreciated, thanks for reading"	Have you discussed price?	939ft4	personalfinance	-1	-1
Parents bad mortgage	"So let me start off by saying I know the way this went down was shady and now it’s coming to haunt my family but I’m looking for guidance or resources not criticism. Anyways here’s the details. My parents have never been good with money and never bothered to keep a good credit score(this is in MI btw). So in 2000 they had their friend get a home loan in her name .(once again I know how dumb this is) fast forward to 2010 and my sister took the house and let it get absolutely destroyed by failing to redo the roof. The house needs over $60000 in work, and has a 140000 mortgage against it. Our plan was to surrender the property back to the bank , but it would leave my parents friends retirement fund open for the bank to take. My mother is absolutely losing her mind over the situation and I do not know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time!"

"Laid off, locked into new home build. Looking for advice"	"The wife and I had decided that it was time to move closer to friends and family, so we chose to build a new house instead of buying a pre-existing home.Everything was going fine, we had put our 10% down on the new place, had our current house on the market, the new house had already broken ground, and was under way.  At the beginning of the month, I was laid off.  Since this threw a major wrench into the works, we decided to call off the selling of our house, and try to work with the builder to get out of the new place.  The builder repeatedly told us that they would work with us to get our deposit back in case something happened.  Needless to say, the builder is being less than forthcoming to offer our deposit back.  Since we've already passed the period where we chose material and colors for the house, this, in a way, locks us in.I've offered to take a hit to our 10% down if he'd be willing to just give us the difference for his time and effort.  I'm more than willing to work with them at this point.I've reached out to a local real estate attorney who says that there might be some grounds for an unjust enrichment case, or the builder being in breach of contract for not doing their due diligence in getting the house done in a timely manner.  We are set on staying in our current house, and no longer want to move.  The kids have had too much instability to try and force another move on them.  I guess what I'm asking is if anyone has dealt with this before, or could point me in the right direction, or can give me some advice in how to move forward.  Worst case scenario I could try to get it settled in court, but I would prefer to settle in amicably.Thank you in advance."	Where is the house?	dhxwta	personalfinance	-1	-1

"I’m not quite sure how to organize my thoughts on this one, I’ll try and number them in order.1. I make $15 an hour to do the job of a general manager in what is a small-medium business 100+ employees and contractors.2. The business experienced a slow period beginning early 2016 and ending mid-late 2017. 3. Sadly, our company’s owner passed away last year, family has taken over and have begun to chase business down, business is now booming for us. We honestly can’t find enough skilled employees to fill our void.... we are actually turning business/contacts down. 4. I want to ask for a raise, but I am afraid to negotiate at this point. I also believe that the job I am doing should pay a minimum of $25 an hour or atleast a 50k salary. 5. I’m currently motivated to either look for a job that pays better or ask for a raise due to being miserable because of another employee that we can’t afford to let go at this point. I am constantly biting my tongue and letting a lot of issues go. The leadership in the company is well aware of the situation and have asked me to be patient and deal with it for the time being.6. If I were to leave the company at this point, it would be extremely hard for them to find someone who could learn a program that I implemented in our company to track finances, inventory, working hours of employees, maintenance on equipment, etc.. I’ve also manipulated the program to create custom reports at the owners request.  No one else in our company is trained to use the program. Do you guys/gals think it would be too soon to negotiate a livable income? I am more motivated than ever at this point because of my unhappiness lately (due to a fellow employee). Should I even mention the fact that I’ve been knowingly putting up with the other employees harrassment/childish games for the past 3 years so that we could attempt to find a replacement or should I just bring up all of the responsibilities I currently have? Should I write a memo or a letter documenting all of my responsibilities? Is it worth approaching the new owners so quickly?

I needed to make 5 on time qualifying payments in order to stop my tax return from being offset, and I made 4 with my 5th scheduled for direct withdrawal on Feb 12th.I'm currently waiting on hold with Dep of Ed to see if there's anything I can do but was wondering if any of you know of options I may have?  Thanks everyone in advance!  I only knew about the student loan rehabilitation program because of you guys!"	Why wouldn’t they take money that’s past due?	aoa1ix	personalfinance	-1	-1
"[advice] Brother is quickly going into debt, asking for how to formulate my argument"	"My brother recently had a Pool installed at the house, it's not quite finished but he is also in a position legally that he can't stop on it.  He mentioned yesterday to me that the pool had pretty much drained his finances, it just turned out more expensive than expected.  He mentioned the other day he was planning on trading in his vehicle, while it still had a good value, and use the equity to get into a lease which he claims he'd pay off.  Somehow it makes sense in his mind and i guess the thought process is the lease would buy enough time for them to rebuild their finances.I've never quite understood him when it comes to vehicles, i always hear ""10 years and it has to go"" or other times about ""i should trade this is while it still has value and i can get a newer one"" Maybe I'm the one who needs straightened out, but i think the smart play would be to attempt to budget better and keep the vehicles as they stand.  Or if he does trade in the vehicle, go buy a used one outright which i don't think he'd ever do.&amp;#x200B;So A, I'm asking if leasing a vehicle has any merit whatsoever?B.

Best way to store money for car payments.	"From all the advice about purchasing a car, it is agreed to take out a loan instead of buying the car on cash.

Credit card company closed my account and made me forfeit my accrued cash rewards without any warning	"My Bank of America credit card account (of 10 years) recently got closed with the reason stating my ""risk profile no longer aligns with the bank's risk tolerance"".I have had this credit card for a while, so I had accrued quite a bit of cash rewards. I never felt the need to cash out my cash rewards and by the time my account closed down, I had ~$182.Upon receiving notice of BOA closing my CC, I attempted to cash out but the website kept giving me errors. The written letter I received stated that ""all cash rewards will be forfeited"". No grace period. No warning. Absolutely nothing.I was aware CC and Debit cards work differently, but it never occurred to me that CC companies can just shut down your account and your cash rewards can disappear on their terms. So, I wanted others to know that if they have a (substantial) amount of cash rewards, be cautious that they can just take it away.TLDR; Bank closed my CC account and made me forfeit all my accrued cash back rewards with no warning.(other details. I have a checking account with BOA and was doing some cryptocurrency trading on the side. I was fully aware that banks don't like cryptocurrency in general because of the legality ""grayness"", so BOA shutting down my checking account didn't come too much of a surprise.

CreditKarma score is significantly different than FICO score	"I am fairly new to credit as I opened my first credit card last August. While I have paid the card off on time each billing cycle, I had a bill from a hospital visit back in 2017 go into collections which has impacted my credit score. BoA shows my FICO score as 617 while CreditKarma has it at 741. Pretty big discrepancy IMO. After a few google and reddit searches, it appears as if I am not alone as other people have reported similar issues. However, their scores were usually off by 10-50 points, not as big of a deficit as mine.I understand CreditKarma uses the Vantage 3.0 which is a different scoring method than FICO but I am still curious as to the large gap in the scores. Which score will lenders most likely use when I apply for a mortgage and other cards? Is there a score I should rely more on to gauge my financial health or is this one of those instances where both scores are taken into account and should be viewed equally?22M, working full time."

How should I use my $1700 auto insurance claim payout?	"Here's what happened: there was a storm and a tree limb struck our parked car. I reported this to my auto insurer, they sent an agent to check out the damage, and shortly after deposited about $1700 in our bank account. This amount is their estimate of repair costs minus a $500 deductible for non-collision damage.My wife and I were actually not expecting any payout unless we went and got it repaired, which we did not intend to do since the damage is purely aesthetic (several large dents on the rear quarter panel). But since they've deposited money in our account already, we're now wondering what we should do. The obvious option is to spend it on repairing the damage, which we haven't ruled out and I'm working on finding a place to go get an estimate from, but which we're not sure we *want* to do. The main reason being, it may end up costing us ~$500 (if the insurance estimate is accurate), and the car works just fine, it just looks ugly with the damage. So my question is basically would it actually be *more* responsible to spend this money paying off some of our debts? Would love to hear from folks who have been in a similar position, thank you!Here are some potential alternative uses I'm considering:* We have about $6k in credit card debt between the two of us and this would be enough to pay the remaining balance on the highest interest card. * Pay off the remaining balance on the auto insurance itself. I pay $115/month for auto insurance and if I pay off my remaining balance ($1266), I'll have that money back each month to put toward debt.* Place in savings account to accrue interest until we are (credit card) debt free and making the repair would be an easier choice to make.Additional details: We use basically every dollar we make monthly after necessary expenses to pay off debt and put in savings, so this is not a trivial amount of money for us (it's about the cost of our monthly rent + utilities)."

Trying to get back on track financially after getting reckless with credit card spending. Need some help	"So I’ve got 3 credit cards I’m trying to pay off. The first two seem to just never be going down every time I look at the balance. One being a credit union that is my main banking location. My credit card from there has a balance of $447.64 that I owe, and an interest rate of 15.5%Current Monthly payments of $25.00Card two is from another credit union that I had to open an account with to get my car loan. $403.26 is what I owe them with an interest rate of 16.5%. Current monthly payments of $25.00Card three... is a Best Buy credit card I opened to purchase a new computer I needed for work. It was a $1,000 purchase back in September of 2017. I have it down to $864.99. There’s zero interest owed on this card so long as I pay it off in the 12 month promotional period. Otherwise, I will be back charged all the owed interest...I’ve only been making monthly payments of $27.00 on this. I was originally planning on using my tax returns to pay most of this off, but alas, I ended up owing a couple bucks this tax season. Yes, I know I’m dumb. I was being naive and reckless. Spent more than I should have. I’m just here hoping some of you folks can help inform me on ways to help pay this off the smartest way.

Feeling a little lost on how to finance a renovation of a unexpectedly inherited home.	"My wife unexpectedly came into possession of her grandfather's old house. It is bought and paid for (i.e. there is no money owed on the home). Since we were struggling with affording the rising cost of living where we were living at the time, we decided to make the jump and move into this house to try and save some money / finally be homeowners. Even though we knew this was a risky move, we still didn't plan well enough for this big life event financially. We have no savings and are living off of just one income until I can also find work. While this works for the time being, it doesn't easily afford us the chance to do some very necessary and big repairs to the home. And in a way we're kind of caught in a cyclical trap of sorts. Let me explain:* The area we live in is prone to hurricanes, so we need to get the house insured asap.* We can't get homeowner's insurance until the house passes a 4 point inspection* To pass this, we need a new roof and a functional heater* We can't afford to pay for these things without financial assistance* We looked into getting a home equity loan or line of credit, but we need insurance first. Also we don't make much money at the moment and are unsure how well our credit scores are doing ( I think that mine is okay since I've been paying off a student loan and credit card on time, but I haven't checked it lately).TL:DR we got a house for free but it needs work. To work on it we need a loan. To get a loan we need insurance. To get insurance we need to fix the house.I know we're not in a totally unsolvable situation, but I was wondering if anybody out there had any helpful advice to offer to a dude who has unwittingly gone from 0-60 mph in the world of fiscal responsibility. Thanks for your time!"

Home buying dilemma	"Hi everyone,I posted a while back about selling our home and buying a new one and I'm here for more advice.We got a buyer and are under contract. We expect to net maybe 22k from our sale.Homes where we are moving are 135k, so max we can put down is 15% and we'll have to pay PMI.Our credit scores are lower than we thought. SO's is 685, mine is 699. Our loan officer is offering interest rates of 4.0% for an FHA loan and 4.75% for a conventional loan. SO is trying to shop around for better rates.FHA has a PMI of $84/month for 11 years if we put 10% down.Conventional loan has a PMI of $71/month.(This was with 10% down for a loan of 142k so it might reduce slightly with 15% down on a smaller loan)Questions:Should we wait till we have saved up 20% to avoid PMI, and maybe have better credit scores? The downside of this is interest rates might rise too and eliminate any savings. We'd also have to pay rent and possibly pay to break a lease in January/February. Not to mention moving costs and a baby on the way in December.FHA vs conventional loan? We want to make additional payments and have the PMI drop, which wouldn't happen with an FHA loan. We would be stuck paying PMI for 11 years but with an ultimately lower monthly payment. ($40 less because of lower rates) It's also a seller's market with homes flying off the market and sellers may be reluctant to accept an offer with FHA rules tied to it. Any and all advice is welcome. We're 26, and the homes where we're moving can only appreciate since it's a college town.Thank you!"

My grandparents vs. loan sharks	"I just found out my grandparents took out a loan from a company called One Main, which apparently specializes in subprime loans. My grandparents have been in a precarious financial situation for several years with declining health and a house that needs lots of repairs. They are in their 80's.Somehow they got this company to lend them $12k and are paying about $450 per month to them. They have Social Security and a pension check that total around $2k per month.My grandma pays all her bills in person, including this bill. In April she went into the branch and was told that she could skip April's payment. She took them at their word and did not make that payment. She was called a few days later and they demanded payment. Since April she has been 1 payment behind. They call her dozens of times per day.She simply cannot afford to pay back this loan. They can barely afford to eat.If she doesn't make the payment, what can they do to them? I assume they will sue and they will win, but can they garnish their Social Security and pension? If One Main has a lien put on their house, can they force my grandparents to sell the house?I don't know why they felt the need to get this loan, it is for something they did not share with us, but I assume it was for repairs to the home. They went through another financial setback several years ago and their credit was trashed from it.Any advice would be appreciated. They live in Wisconsin."

[US/Canada] I'm planning on getting student loans and becoming an international student in Canada. What should I aim for as far as loans?	"I'm an American citizen. I plan on going to community college in the US and get my grades where they need to be and then heading up to Canada to finish up the last 2 years of my degree.I'm expecting roughly $110-120k CAD in debt from this.My degree would be in Computer Science with a focus in information security. I am not worried about finding a job post graduation as the tech hubs there (Vancouver and Toronto) are always hiring for Technical roles. I know it would be difficult as, I would need to find a job pretty much immediately after leaving school making at least 80-90k CAD a year at minimum and preferably 100-120k CAD.The attraction to this route is it helps with immigration by securing extra points by graduating from a Canadian University AND allowing me to work in the country for up to 3 years, when it comes to their Comprehensive Scoring System for Express Entry applicants.Is there any preferably way of going about doing this?"

Changing employment status in company - How do I optimize this change?	"Last year, I was hired through an agency as a freelancer on a 1-year contract through a staffing agency and was paid hourly. The company now wants to onboard me as a freelancer but under their ""roster"" directly and put me on salary.With the agency out of the equation, my company will obviously be shelling out less money on my compensation.

My mom opened an investment account in my name and I have not known about it. I need tax help.	"Hey guys, I was hoping y'all could help me figure out the tax implications of my situation.  I'm 30 and live in Alabama (US).My mom just told me about a Goldman Sachs investment account she opened for me as a minor many years ago as part of the ""Uniform Transfers to Minors Act"".  I did not know about the account until recently so I have not transferred it over to my name and have never claimed taxes.  She wants me to liquidate the account and give her the money.  She does not handle finances well and I don't need the money so that is not an issue.  But I am worried about how this will affect my taxes.  One more wrinkle to the story... the SSN they have listed for me is wrong.  They transposed a digit so the IRS currently has no idea this account is related to me.  1.

Conservative half of savings for a house: HYSA or Bonds?	"I've been unsure how to allocate the conservative portion of my saving for a house.I'd figured a 50/50 split between equities and a conservative position would be a good way to invest money that I definitely want to have around in 5-10 years.On one hand, I have a High-Yield Savings Account that gets 3.3%, which outpaces inflation and guarantees no fluctuation in the market.One the other hand, I know the conventional recommendation is to invest in a bond fund. However the last several years in a total market bond fund would have lost you 2%-3%. But I know that reinvestment of dividends counts for something too.Is one a better option than another?"

Should I take out a loan?	"I work a lot of hours on part time salary, while going to college. I was originally wanting to move out, but want to save money while at home. I only want one thing in life right now as a personal want rather than a need... a really good computer for games and editing softwares and everything. I have all of my parts picked out as well as monitors, and its around 4k i want to take out of the bank as a loan... would it be a decent idea to take a loan from the bank to help pay for this project? I just don't have enough and it would take a while to acquire the funds, even at home.

Negotiating a salary for a new position at a company where I am currently an hourly wage employee.	"Hi PF,Some background :I have recently interviewed for a position that is at my current company (roughly 500 employees) but in another department. My current supervisor called me today to give me a heads up ""off the record"" that it is likely they are going to make me an offer. I would have entirely different job responsibilities, but to put the position into perspective there are about 20 employees with my current title and 1 person with the new title. I currently make $16.50/hr with 1.5x overtime past 40 hours, however I work a few months out of the year where I am paid at a slightly higher rate via monthly bonus. I also am paid quite a bit in expenses as I use my personal vehicle, and am reimbursed at the IRS rate. In 2018 I grossed about $54k, with about $9k of that coming from expenses.  The one other person in my new position is salaried at about $50k. My personal vehicle will not be used as often, but still on occasion. I am looking for advice for opening salary negotiation when the time comes. I would really like to be making $60+ but I don't know if that is feasible. Any advice on this is appreciated, particularly if anyone has been in this type of position before. Thanks!!"	How different is the job from what you’re currently doing?	apxf49	personalfinance	-1	-1
"Should I break it off from my parents financially, or am I being stupid?"	"Background: I am 22 years old and in college. My parents cover almost all of my expenses. Tuition, car and health insurance, cell phone bill, rent, and some food expenses. I pay for my gas and any personal items, including some food expenses. I have $22k in a bank account as an inheritance from my deceased grandfather. I work a part-time job at my college that can only go up to 20 hrs a week per University policy. I have 5-6 quarters left at my school before I can graduate. I am graduating with a liberal arts degree but plan to complete the prerequisites for vet school at a community college and work full-time before applying.My mother handles most of the finances and is constantly complaining to me about the expenses of sending me to school, paying for everything for me, and more recently is now complaining about paying health bills for me, saying I go to the doctor unnecessarily. The health bill thing is a bit confusing as the only real bill she's had for my medical stuff was an urgent care visit, but otherwise my visits have been copay only which I cover. This complaining has been going on for years and it is seriously draining and is starting to have a negative impact on my mental health. When I offer to take on my expenses through financial aid and student loans, she refuses, and says she and my father ""agreed to pay for 4 years of college, so that's what they're going to do."" I never expected this of them, but every time I mention it, she says the same thing.I am aware that I'm incredibly lucky to have my parents pay for so much, and that many people would love to be in my position. But the constant nagging and complaining is damaging both my own mental health, and my relationship with them. Should I just suck it up and reap the benefits of them paying for another year? Or should I break off from them financially and pay for the rest of my schooling, likely making living difficult for the next few years."

Cheque bounced from wifes inheritance account when there's more than enough money in the account (UK)	"My wife's grandfather passed away and left equal shares of money to all the grandkids and great grandkids etc she hasn't cashed hers in yet, but is hearing that the family members that have had the cheques cashed have had them bounce.Her auntie has control of the account and gave out the cheques so there is no suspicion of foul play at all.

Disability for mother with memory problems (US)	"Hi personalfinance, I'm helping a friend find his mother's medical records after she had a brain injury, and we're at a bit of a loss.

Years prior to this, she was in a car accident that prevented her from working (she had foot/knee problems that apparently limited her movement).  We have access to all the records from her most recent trip to the hospital, but she doesn't remember much about her previous injury or the healthcare surrounding that.  In the process of applying for disability, we're being asked for her records surround the foot/knee injury.

Advice - Loan from my 403b	"So I have 3 credit cards that have semi-large outstanding balances, all with an APR over 18%. I recently learned I can take a loan from my 403b at 6.25% interest and pay it back in two years by using contributions to my 403b (I contribute about $230 a pay period, a 2 year pay back would be about $200 per pay period, meaning I'm not taking away from my monthly income).Taking a loan, I could pay off 2 of 3 card balances and then use what I was paying monthly towards my 3 cards and put them all towards the last card balance without affecting my income. Downsides: I'm stalling my retirement contributions for about 2 years. If I leave the company before the loan is paid back, I have 90 days to payback the remainder of the loan balance or I incur some large tax penalties (I feel pretty secure with my job, never had a below average performance review and I have plenty of work to do so I feel pretty safe).This is a no brainier right? Once I finish paying card 3 of 3, I could up my contributions to pay off the loan quicker. Open to any and all advice on the matter!"

I'm 22 and have a credit score of 727, so I think I could qualify for a loan but I'm sure my parents would be willing to cosign, which might make my interest rate lower."

Multiple Rewards Credit Cards	"I’m looking for advice on using multiple rewards credit cards. I’m 30 yo, $94k salary, 800 FICO score, no car or student loan debt, and rent in MCOL area. I currently have 2 rewards credit cards - BoA platinum rewards and Chase United Explorer, which I use exclusively. I pay my credit card balance in full every month. Since United’s change in their rewards program, I’ve been considering applying for the AmEx Marriott card because I could get more rewards from that card faster. My question is, how should I balance spend among the three cards? My first thought would be to switch over to exclusively using the new card and leave the other ones stagnant (closing them would decrease my FICO score, right?) unless I’m booking a United flight in which case I would use the Chase card for priority boarding and free checked bags. Would I be able to maximize rewards by doing a balance transfer from AmEx to Chase to BoA and then paying off BoA? I’m not familiar with that process and have read that fees are often imposed to do balance transfer. It also seems like a lot of work, unless I could automate it. Thanks in advance for any advice!"

"Recently paid off a large chunk of debt, curious about what to do now."	"Just submitted my final payment for my graduate student loans - it was my goal to get it paid in full by the end of this year, and I started the year with a bit north of $20k. That was emotional! Curious about insights on what to do with the relative surplus of income I'll have moving forward. The only other debt I have right now is a $20k car loan (got the car in fall 2018 and have been making minimum payments on it, 5.1% APR ). My original goal was to get the car loan paid off by end of next year, but I'm also keen on building up some more liquidity/investments....Info if it helps:1) I have about 4 months of living expenses in cash, most of it in a high yield savings account (1.8% APY) . 2) I max out my Roth IRA every year and also contribute around $6,700ish annually to a couple other smaller investments I have.3) I am renting, and I have no immediate plans to buy a home - but expect within the year to move into my partner's home and would like to do some cosmetic upgrades on the place, ideally, at or less than $5k? 4) I do foresee marriage and children in the near future (1-2 years). My partner has debt (not sure how much is personal and how much is through the family business) and no savings/no retirement funds set aside. This is a bit hard for me to wrap my head around. 5) I have two jobs: I do freelance work in one field and per diem work in another, so my income is steady-ish but not fixed and I usually get slammed in taxes. A few years ago I grossed just over $90k and owed $12k. That was a bullish year for me and this year I'll probably make about 75% of that.As I'm writing this, I realize I should probably spend the next few months hammering down to save up for taxes.

It’s a little bit aggressive, but it’s nice knowing I have a little cushion over there if need be."	Like if you only pay car insurance once a year - do you save up the amount monthly?	bmrprr	personalfinance	-1	-1
"Can't find a place to live that I can ""afford"" on middle class income."	"I gross right around $40k/yr, take home is about $2300/mo. I'm 1 year out of college and still live with my parents but I would like to move out.Problem is, the rent market where I live (Las Vegas) is ridiculous. Going by the 30% rule that I learned from here, I can afford $766/mo for housing, so I'd call that $700 for rent and the rest utilities.Looking at google reviews for places that cost $700/mo, all of them are 1-2 stars. Roach infested, people getting shot in the parking lot, you name it. I don't need to live in the nicest part of town but I don't think I would feel safe living in a place that $700 will buy you here.Cheapest I can find for a place that I would actually be comfortable living in is around $950 + utilities. I know I can't really afford that, and I don't really want to pay that much, but what are my other options? Obviously roommates but I really don't want to live with roommates."

Payment due and statement balance zero? Capitol One	"I purchased something with my capital One Credit card for about £60,  but i was wondering why it says  ""Your Payment Due is £0. Statement Balance is £0.  Next Payment Due by 18th of October.""      Shouldn't the payment due  be £60?"	When did you make the purchase?	9jcyib	personalfinance	-1	-1
Should I buy this boat?	"First off I know it’s a bad financial decision. But I really want one and I’m getting older and starting to think it’s time to have fun while I can. I just want some perspectives on how bad it’ll be financially. Ask me anything you want. Here’s my stats:  40M. Single, no kids. Lowish salary ($85k). Net worth of $450k but $100k of that is in home equity. Total housing payment: $700 monthlyCurrent car lease:  $140 monthlyNo other real debt. Current savings rate is about 40% and that will be drastically reduced if I buy the boat. The boat I want is a 220 Sundeck (Sea Ray) and I think I could get it for a little less than $20k. I’d have to drydock it and I think that’ll be about $200/month. Lots in maintenance and winterization.  So what do you think, financiers of reddit?  Live it up now or not regret it later?  Is it feasible?"	Where do you live?	8kx06z	personalfinance	-1	-1

Is this something that my gf/fiance/wife depending on when it happens will have to deal with?"	"So the question, is the estate solvent or not?"	8ma4qm	personalfinance	-1	-1
"The most important line to read on a credit card statement is ""purchases"", I've decided."	"Late last year I added up my credit cards and realized I was over $8K in debt. I knew I hadn't been able to pay off the balances in a while, but every month I'd shrug, try to use the card less, try to do better. When I added them all up I was shocked. I started combing through the statements to see where I was going wrong. Turns out there was a lot I could cut out, so I set myself a goal. I paid as much as I could towards the higher interest one - it earns more cash back, so I was using it the most, then realized that was a terrible idea and cut it up. My one card I'd use for gas/repairs/emergencies I paid to an even balance that I checked every single day so I'd know how much I had SPENT - if I started the month at $5K on it and the balance was $5,700 I instantly knew I'd spent $700 so far.I realize this sounds totally obvious, but at 38 years old I just realized that if my spending is more than what I make, my debt will go in the wrong direction. I know what I earn every month so I easily figured up what that ""spending"" line had to be if I was going to start chipping away at debt.Credit card statements have these huge obvious boxes now about how your minimum payments work, and that's great, but I wish they'd highlight ""hey here's what you SPENT this month!""Today I'm about $4K in debt, a number that still makes me sad but at least I've been moving the right direction."

I’m almost 2 months in with no credit card payments. Both cards are maxed. I need some advice.	"For some personal reasons, I haven’t been able to pay off my cards and it’s been since May 18th. I’m nearly 2 months in. Both cards are over their limit because of interest and I’m just wondering how long I can go until I get sued or letters in the mail? I’ve always heard bad stories about things that happen when you miss payments. I was fired from my job recently so I have no income. Trying to find a new job ASAP so I can start working towards these payments. I’m only 21. I feel irresponsible because both 1k limits are maxed. I was using the cards a lot on vacation in April and I was fired from work in May.Am I in trouble if I don’t get this situated soon?"

Debt collector help	"I just now received a phone call, and the person on the call sounded like an appropriate sounding debt collector.  She told me my name and last 4 of social.  I said that was me. Then tells me I owe 164 bucks from an outstanding debt and asks if I want to resolve it. I told her I have no idea what the debt is, especially since in the past two years i have resolved all my debts and collections on my credit report (didnt say this part to her). She tells me it is from a payday advance from September 2011. I told her I am not even sure the debt is accurate.  I did do payday advances around that time but I believe I resolved all of them. I asked for proof, and was told that they have been sending me notices to an old address which I told her was 7 years old too. I told her I am disputing the charge and not paying. She said she will put that down and then see how that works out for me. She hung up before me. Totally caught me off guard. I am able to pay the amount now, but no idea why I should due to its age, also more importantly, its validity.  Thoughts?"	Did you ever apply for a payday loan online?	9cvj27	personalfinance	-1	-1
