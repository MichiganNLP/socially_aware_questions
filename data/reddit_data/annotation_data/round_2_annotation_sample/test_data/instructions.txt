Instructions:

The goal of this task is to label questions according to their relevance to a given post. Please follow the following steps:
1. Read the post title ("post_title"), and the first five sentences of the post text ("post_text")
2 Read the question that was asked in response to the post ("question").
3. Label the question according to its relevance to the post (fill in "question_is_relevant") and according to whether the question asks for more information (fill in "question_asks_for_more_info").
A question is relevant to the post if it concerns information that is included in the post or is highly relevant to the topic of the post.
A question asks for more information if it seeks new information that was not obvious from the post or seeks to clarify information included in the post that was not clear.
You may need to read more text from the post to decide on the label, if the first five sentences are not enough.


You will fill in the "question_is_relevant" and "question_asks_for_more_info" columns in the spreadsheet.
Please use the following scale:
1 for yes
0 for no
-1 for unsure


We provide several example posts and questions with associated labels:
1. Is the question relevant to the post?
- Example post 1: "I am trying to bake a cake, and I'm not sure what kind is best. What kind of cake should I bake?
    - Q1: "What flavor of cake do you want?" => question addresses a specific aspect of "cake" which is mentioned in the post; question_is_relevant=1
    - Q2: "Why aren't you making a pie?" => question addresses "pie" which is off-topic to the post; question_is_relevant=0
- Example post 2: "I got offered a job on the border of South Dakota and Minnesota. From various real estate sites, it seems that similar houses are considerably cheaper in Minnesota. Are there any reasons I should not look at Minnesota as an option?"
    - Q1: "What is the resale value on homes in Minnesota?" => question addresses an aspect of house ownership (resale value) which is relevant to the post; question_is_relevant=1
    - Q2: "Have you considered moving to North Dakota?" => question addresses a state that is irrelevant to the post; question_is_relevant=0

2. Is the question asker trying to get more information from the post author?
- Example post 1: "I am trying to bake a cake, and I'm not sure what kind is best. What kind of cake should I bake?
    - Q1: "What flavor of cake do you want?" => question asker seeks more information from author about cake; question_asks_for_more_info=1
    - Q2: "You don't know what kind of cake you should bake?" => likely rhetorical question, not looking for additional information; question_asks_for_more_info=0
- Example post 2: "I currently have about 3k in the bank and just got my first real job out of college. It pays about 70k/year. Im looking at purchasing my first car to commute there (a 2018 mazda 6). Should I buy it?"
    - Q1: "Roughly how much does the car cost?" => question seeks more information from author about car; question_asks_for_more_info=1
    - Q2: "Who would think that 3k is enough to buy a car?" => question is challenging post author and not expecting new information; question_asks_for_more_info=0

Please keep track of the total amount of time (in minutes) that you spend on annotation from start to finish.
