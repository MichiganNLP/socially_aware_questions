8phwx3	I’m 30, have a well-paying job in Silicon Valley, many close friends in my area, a fantastic dog, yet was recently thrown off mightily by the following: A girl I dated for about 6 years recently got married. She and I were together for most of college, and a few years after. We broke up about 5 years ago, and while I still think about her sometimes, I figured I was genuinely over this....however..,,The other day I was informed by mutual friends that she had gotten married. For whatever reason, this news made me feel really strange. These feelings were not about jealousy, nor were they about the new impossibility of she and getting back together...I just felt strange and can’t shake it. I haven’t had a serious or meaningful relationship since she and I broke up, but I’ve never really correlated that fact to our breakup; I’ve always just felt I was focusing on other things and hadn’t met the right person. I always said this breakup was good for both parties, I’ve gone on to advance in my career further than I ever dreamed of, and she pursued an advanced degree at a top school. Neither would have happened had we stayed together. Despite those positives, her getting married has meShook, and wondering if I’ve made some serious mistakes in prioritizing my career over my life. Towards improving, I’m thinking about volunteering or looking into something a bit more fulfilling than my job in tech, but I still just feel like I’m in a rut, and am having a hard time looking forward to anything at all; I sit in bed in the morning and really struggle to find the positives in the day that awaits me. If anyone has been in a similar rut, or simply has some wisdom to impart, I’ll gladly take it  	Advice	And how would I feel if I did the same?	Do I like the taste of the relationship?	-1	-1	-1

d1gl4d	I’m not sure what exactly I’m asking for by posting this, I just feel really upset and pissed off and I want perspectives from people who didn’t go to my high school. When I was a sophomore in high school (15) I met a senior guy who was 19. I was obviously super flattered and love struck, I had never even held hands with a boy. At first things went okay, he was my first kiss and stuff. One day at my house he asked me if I was comfortable progressing sexually. I was so conflicted. I told him I was okay with rubbing, but not with fingering or anything further. He started rubbing me and as it got more intense he started fingering me. I tried pushing his hands away and said “wait” but he kept going and my entire body froze up. I just fucking laid there. I had never even seen a penis before in my life and he pulled his out of his pants and pushed my head up and down on him. I remember I almost started crying when he came, I was absolutely terrified and had no idea what was happening. But I was in love. And so, so fucking stupid. I thought that now that I’d passed that point, there was no going back. I was no longer someone who hadn’t done those things, If that makes sense. We eventually had sex, same kind of situation. I told him no and he did anyway, and my dumb ass just froze up. After, i wasn’t a virgin anymore so what was the point? I let him continue to have sex with me regularly. He mentally abused me and used me for sex. One time we were hanging out and when he found out I was on my period, he dropped me off and left. Eventually my parents found out and obviously it was statutory rape, him being 19 and me being 15. It was reported and I went through almost 2 years of trial. He ended up getting 90 non consecutive days in jail, didn’t have to register, nothing. A few weeks later he was found with another naked underage girl in his backseat, just another 10 days in jail. This man was well known in the community, and fairly popular. I lost all of my friends and was bullied severely. My severe anxiety prevented me from being able to even leave my house. I feel like he stole my life from me. My freshman year of high school was great, my life since then has been absolute hell. I hate myself for everything I put my parents through, I initially blamed them when they turned it in and was in a hospital for a week following a failed suicide attempt. I just can’t come to terms with what has happened and I feel this intense rage for everyone who bullied me. I was told I was asking for it and I ruined his life and I was a whore despite him being my first kiss. How can people say that about a rape victim? I cry almost constantly because of everything. I take counseling but nothing seems to help. I don’t want this to define me, but it’s so hard not to let it.	Advice	How can people say that a rape victim?

e46xwl	Hey, I work at a food delivery service. Kinda like door dash. But I use my own car, I get paid 3 dollars an hour every hour under 28 and over 28 I get 4. I work about 45 hours a week. I make most my money on tips, the issue is that people are not tipping. They pay a delivery fee of 3.99 and like we can drive the food like 20 miles no prob. But I’m getting screwed because people aren’t tipping because they have to pay a delivery fee when that’s the service we offer. Like cmon I use my own vehicle, gas, pay for my own insurance, drive to whatever restaurant you want from wherever I am, then to your house. I sometimes drive 20+ miles for a delivery route.

9bfgqi	Before I start, there will be no TL;DR because it’s so specific and you have to know the full details. If you can read the whole thing and comment, that’d be great.Okay so I’m a junior in high school and stuck between a rock and a hard place. I’m in the soccer class, I love soccer and all my best friends are in it too but there’s a couple of people I have problems with there, and having trouble. First of all, I’m supposed to have the class 2 times in my schedule but since I take IB classes, it doesn’t permit me to have it two times but one. The coach said this is a problem because I’m new, not really (I was at this school freshmen year but moved sophomore year), and it will be very hard for me to make the team because I won’t be double-blocked and new. Now, I know I can probably make the team just based off of my ability to play the sport, I’m better than most players in my position. Also, they stay after school to run for about an hour and a half but I haven’t been staying because my mom works from 2-10 and my dad probably won’t wanna go pick me up late because I live kinda far from the school and he already hates having to pick me up so far early. The coach asked me if this was really worth it for me, which I didn’t really understand. There is the option to stay at my aunts place near the place until my mom gets out of work but then again I work in the evening near my house. That’s the soccer situation.Now I can quit soccer and join the wrestling team. I was a wrestler freshmen year and fell in love with the sport. I feel very welcomed there and the wrestlers there are great. They don’t stay after school right now but they will later on the year. Same problem with transportation here. Except maybe I can force my dad to pick me up late. The thing is I’m very prone to getting staph and I’m scared that I get it again. Last option is to quit sports and take on a regular class, like computer or statistics etc. No problem with transportation here, less stress, but I wouldn’t be as active as I’d like to be. Now I know I probably won’t go to college for sports and not really considering it, but I love these sports. What would your advice be here? I’m have a headache every time I think of what I have to do. Thanks.	Advice	Do you have anyone else in the area you can stay with?	Have you tried wrestling or another sport?	-1	-1	-1
9cy232	Today during my Chemistry class we got to write down on a piece of paper who we wanted to have a lab partner with tomorrow. There is this girl in that class that I want to get to know but I was nervous about putting her name down so I didn't, I just wrote that I had no preference. I don't know what she wrote down because there isn't really people in that class who she is amazing friends with. I'm hoping she wrote me down on her paper but she most likely didn't. I was nervous about writing her name because if the teacher announced that I had wanted to be with her she might think that is strange and she might be wanting to be with someone else. I think I messed up but I don't know what else I could have done in that situation.	Advice	Did you know her name prior to starting the class?

94g8lo	"I never feel happy, and I want to change that. Everyday I feel sad and lonely. I never see my dad, which does contribute to my unhappiness but I've gotten used to it. My mom is always unhappy and she always yells. Every time she yells I feel very hurt and scared, I've asked her if she could just talk instead but she has not agreed. I try to talk to her about problems in my life, but the only ""advice"" she gives me is that her life is harder. She has always told me to be the best in school,  and I've associated my performance in school with my self worth. Last year I've dropped from a straight A student to having C's and D's. My mom has seen my grades when the year ended and told me she was very disappointed in me and ignored me for the rest of the day. I tried to kill myself because I felt as if I no longer had any self worth, and my mom noticed and just told me how stupid I was for my decisions. I later regretted my decisions and made myself throw up so I wouldn't die. I'm very lonely at school because I cannot open up to anyone out of my fear of being hurt out judged. The only thing that made me happy was being in a relationship with my ex because he always made me feel accepted, but I had to leave him two months ago. So, I'm here on Reddit looking for advice on how I can improve my life. **TLDR; I've recently been getting suicidal thoughts again and my grades are dropping.

cur0g0	I have to go to a group meeting on Monday to discuss empathy and professionalism with my bosses. Let me just start by saying, the company I work for is a clusterfuck. Extremely disorganized and shady shit happening. We have less than 50 employees and the CEO comes in on a weekly basis to deal with whatever he has to.I’ve been working for this company for over 2 years now. A few weeks ago, he called up here and talked to my coworker and asked who was working. She told him I was and he had no clue who I was. He then asked if “Violet” (not my name) was working. My coworker said no and repeated that I was working. He continued to call me Violet and then said to my coworker “oh, it doesn’t matter. It starts with a V. I was close.”I find it really disrespectful that I put so much time and effort into this company, making him look good, and lining his pockets for him not to remember something as simple as my name. I feel like it would be different if we had more employees, but there are so few of us and he’s here all the time.So my question is: should I bring up the lack of his professionalism about not giving two fucks about the employees enough to learn who they are?Thanks for advice in advance.

9yt3ay	so, first of all, this will be a lengthy post so please bear with me(will put a TL:DR on the end) second of all, the prison visit is not meant in a criminal sense, but I'm debating visiting someone who is in jail.Alright so with that out of the way, here goes: I'm 19 and an old friend of my dad is in jail. This guy has been in jail since my 13th orso and will likely be there till my 35th roughly, But I am debating visiting him and I have no clue whether I'm ready to see what has become of him in these 6 years.The backstory for this: He was a good friend of my dad for tens of years and I therefore met him quite a few times in my younger years, he always seemed like a fantastic guy, and I loved spending time there because me and my brother played GTA on his playstation, or we'd have fun and dinner in the garden near a fireplace, typical stuff but I loved it. No clue whether my child like innocence just never noticed his real self, or whether he just snapped because of the situation he ended up in. either way I thought he was an awesome guy.He however had a girlfriend(thought it was a lovely woman but now I know better, hence why I'm not sure if I want to meet the friend now) who ended up cheating on him, quite a few times with all kinds of different men.they also had a young boy, presumably theirs, but not sure. He one day found out about his girlfriends affairs, which he didnt react to very well, he started walking around the neighbourhood with a knife. for as far as I know he wasnt out to hurt anyone in particular, but I guess it was his reaction to the cheating.This ended up in a police intervention, they took him in custody and he was held for about a day, after which he was released but monitored. His girlfriend was moving out because of both the above mentioned reasons. in the meantime however he apparently found out about a guy who had also been with his GF and I believe he and my dads friend had some kind of fallout because this guy was trying to blackmail him. my dads friend in the meantime also lost his kids custody to his GF. He ended up hiring two guys to kill the blackmailer, guess he didnt take all the shit going on around him well, underatandably enough.these two 'hired mercenaries' or whatever they were, killed the blackmailer(I'm positive the blackmailer was affiliated to crime too, but no clue what it was anymore)the police found the body in a small lake, tracked down the hired mercenaries, and got to my dads friend that way. he was trialed and jailed for roughly 21 years.Over the years however, I always get a birthday card from him, with some wise words on it, including him recognising his stupid decisions and telling me to not make them, which is why I have started wondering how he is doing, because I have never talked to him in these 6 years, and yet he still sends me a birthday card every day, well written and with good advice.one of the reasons I am doubting a visit is the fact he got cought a year or two back with a lot of medication(probably trying to kill himself, cant say for sure though)I can't reliably tell from my past what he is like, especially can't imagine what kind of changes 6 years of prison may have made, but on the other hand he still seems to know his ways judging by the birthday cards.I am not sure anymore whether I'd be off well visiting because after all he still ordered a murder, on the other hand I sympathise with the situation he was in and, i dont remember him as a bad person.so any advice on what to do?TL:DR dads friend got in a nasty situation, ended up hiring two people to kill someone, but I remember him as a good guy and he still seems to be judging by the cards he sends. Not sure whether I should visit him after 6 years of no contact from my end	Advice	Do you have a security camera?	Are you sure he is in jail?	-1	-1	-1

8lpzvz	Hi. I’ve been a police officer for the past 5 years now. I have done it since 19 years old and it was the only thing I ever wanted to do since I was a child. Since the start of this year I have started to really dislike the job. I work with great people and am very capable at what I do but recently I have lost the desire to turn up at every shift. I have given specialist roles within the police a try but I have never really enjoyed them. I feel as though it’s time for me to try something else in life but I honestly feel completely unqualified to do any other job. I have zero qualifications outside of policing and have never studied outside of high school. I guess I’m looking for suggestions on jobs or if any sort of advice.

acy4ou	I'm not sure which is the best subreddit for this, but figured I'd pick one to ask. I think with each month I'm starting to masturbate more and more. The crazy thing is I'm not even a regular porn watcher, I have a fetish for a certain something that you can literally find almost anywhere, think like leather or boobs, mine is a physical object. Whenever I'm around that object I get turned on. I can't exactly quit not getting a high sex drive since it's a part of me, nor not being around my fetish since it's an everyday thing. To me the sensation of having an orgasm just feels really good, in fact so good, that it's now becoming a mental distraction in my life. I'm realizing there have been days I really should be doing a certain something, but my drive will cause me to masturbate, I'll get distracted, and whatever I was supposed to do for the day, just won't get accomplished and is now procrastinated for the next. I don't know how to deal with an issue I can't simply just put away, like drugs and cigarettes, since my addiction is right out in open public.  	Advice	Do you have an orgasm during the day?

8qp0wa	"Hi all. I didn't know whether to post this here on r/advice or r/relationship_advice, but I figured here because the latter seems to be more like BF-GF kind of relationships.On to the main topic of my post, it's about my friend who has been horrible to me recently. We've known each other for 4 years now, and we've been through A LOT together. We suffered through many camps, we went out to watch movies, have meals, barbecues, going to amusement parks, and we even travelled to the same country together for a school trip. He always brings a lot of laughter into my life, and I am truly grateful for it.However, there's a tendency of him to do this to me every single time. Whenever I cannot go out with him to study or play, because I have my own plans, he gets really mad about it. In March, I couldn't go out with him and a few others to a trampoline park, and he was frustrated to the point he did not talk to me via SMS for like almost a week. (PS. It was doing a school break, so we did not see each other IRL.)Recently, the same thing happened again, except a bit worse. He asked if I could go out to study with him, but I couldn't because I wanted my home environment to do some Science papers. He said: ""what an absolute piece of s***"" and I said sorry. He said ""I'm sorry too"" and proceeded to block me on WhatsApp.Right now, I know it's part of his nature to do such childish acts, even at our age, but it really is annoying whenever he does it. It will definitely pass, and he is just trying to guilt trip me to go out with him, as he did in previous times. I don't know if he does this to other friends in our group, but honestly, I feel that he is taking me for granted. I sacrificed a lot for him (including a bit of my reputation in school), and spent time trying to help him with Homework and comforting him. Yet, he treats me like this every. single. time. And he doesn't seem to understand that I have my own life too.I want to continue this friendship, it's a really important one to me, but unlike my other close friends, he's the only one that does this childish act of ignoring/blocking me JUST because I have my own plans and life and can't be with him 24/7. What should I do?"	Advice	How old are you?	Have you tried talking to him about it?	-1	-1	-1
bs15at	Firstly I should say I'm a 26 year old Bisexual man. My partner of 8 years is a 26 year old Bisexual woman.&amp;#x200B;Word Vomit incoming... I've never written this out before.&amp;#x200B;I have never had a high sex drive. I enjoy sex when I have it, but I'm never simply 'ready' for sex. It takes time for me to get warmed up, and feel aroused enough. I'm not exactly in great physical fitness (not overweight but very low muscle mass and little excersise), so pleasure comes with a significant amount of physical excertion. I also struggle to orgasm through sex. I'm currently on anti-depressants as well which makes it even harder. My head just isnt in the right place.&amp;#x200B;I've spoken about this with my partner over and over again. She has a very high sex drive, could have sex every day if it was availible. However, she does not enjoy instigating sex and often finds that by the time I am aroused, she isnt any more. With the right approach, I feel like I can become aroused fairly quickly, and I certainly don't just sit there and wait to be ready, I try and reciprocate as much as possible (within the things I enjoy)&amp;#x200B;Day-to-day, I have 0 desire for sex. None. Very, very occasionally I will actively approach my patner for sex. Early in our relationship I would be more proactive in trying to instigate sex, but now it is very rare. I can't force myself to do something I'm not in the mood to do.&amp;#x200B;I feel broken, and wether she means to or not, my patner makes me feel like this is MY problem which I need to fix. I don't know what the solution is, and I feel like she doesnt understand what is going on in my head. Fuck, I dont even think I quite understand.&amp;#x200B;My patner also has a desire for fairly extreme (by my standards) bondage, which isnt something I enjoy. I feel like there's a mental block preventing me from offering the type of rough, punishment-style of sex that she wants.&amp;#x200B;It's reached a point where we have agreed that my partner can go and seek sex elsewhere if that is what she wants. She had met someone who was also into bondage, but she decided against it due to there being no sexual attraction.&amp;#x200B;I love her to pieces, and I want to be intimate more. She is the most important person in my life and I would be lost without her. But without this physical connection I dont know if I can be enough. I don't seem to be able to communicate my feeling to her, no matter how hard I try.&amp;#x200B;Any discussion always seems to end up with me being the bad guy. If I ever bring up the fact that sex often ends up as a one sided affair (as in, a lot of work on my part to offer sexual pleasure), I quickly get shut down as i'm 'making her the bad guy'. My Patner does a great job of arousing me, when she tries. The problem really is that she doesn't feel like she should have to try, I should just want to when she does.&amp;#x200B;I feel so fucked up, but I cant just flip a switch and fix myself. AITA ?

cdc2x7	"My (f25) little sister Emma(19) and her fiancé Joe(27) are getting married and invited me to be a bridesmaid. I initially accepted and was very excited about all of it, but lately I've been thinking of telling her I don't want to anymore.I'm not allowed to attend and watch them actually get married, my immediate and extended family are all Mormon, so my little sister is getting married in a Mormon temple. As soon as I found out it was a Temple wedding I tried to renew my temple recommend (you need one to get into the temple), so I sat through an interview and lied about a lot of questions (I'd be considered ""unworthy"" if I told the truth), but then I was told I'd have to pay around 15,000 of back tithing because I haven't paid in 5 years. I obviously didn't do that.I told my sister I couldn't get a recommend and she said ""that's fine you can watch all the kids outside of the temple"" and I didn't want to at first but I agreed since it would be her wedding day. I said ""lol ok but who's going to watch them at the ring exchange after the temple"" (mormons just recently allowed having another wedding ceremony before or after the temple without waiting a year) and she said they aren't doing one anymore because Joe said it would ""steal away from the sacredness of just being sealed"". Now I have to be a bride's maid for a temple marriage (even thought have a wedding line doesn't make sense with a temple marriage), not see my little sister get married, and play babysitter in a parking lot.I reminded her that our mom wouldn't be able to see her get married now since she was excommunicated and that she'd be devastate.

cdzpt1	I (21F) go out a lot. And i’m sociable so I like to make friends. I also have a boyfriend who doesnt go at. At all. Which means when I go out with my friends guys will be nice to us and ask for instagrams, especially if we’re going with a group that we dont know everyone. We’ll talk at the pregame and be friendly.Some of these guys are probably interested in befriending the girls for less than innocent reasons. I really just want to be friends with these guys because that means I have more people to go out with. Whenever I friend someone I make NO inclination that i’m interested and I will sometimes mention I have a boyfriend IF AND ONLY IF we’re on the topic. I dont like making assumptions that anyone is interested in me. I will keep talking to these guys and have actually made quite a few friends this way.It’s also not a secret I have a boyfriend either, most people know or if they friend me they’ll see I have a lot of photos with him.One guy however, suddenly asked me out. I politely declined saying I have a boyfriend and wasnt interested. He got angry and basically yelled at me asking why I would even talk to him or any other guy if I was in a relationship. Then he blocked me on everything.I personally dont see anything wrong with having friends of the opposite sex. If that was the case i’d just be objectifying men, if I only saw them as people to date and not to befriend. AITA??	AmItheAsshole	You don't have a boyfriend but your friends are interested?

crms2d	"Backstory: My fiancee, Jane I dated on again off again for about 10 years, going 2 or 3 years between dating for 6 or 7 months at a time. During one of said breaks I was with another woman, Annie, who obviously didn't work out, and Jane and I got back together, and have been going strong for just over 3 years.Asshole situation: I have numerous female friends, the majority of whom are in stable, long term relationships, about half of whom I was in relationships with, of varying degrees of seriousness, but nothing lasting more than a year or so. A few weeks ago, one of my exes, who I am on very good terms with had a baby with her husband, and I sent a baby gift basket with towels, soaps, cloths, clothes, etc. Jane had a problem with this, saying ""any woman you've had sex with can't be your friend and I don't want them in our life.""This is an ongoing problem, considering that my most recent ex, Annie (broken up 4 years ago) and I are great friends, but I am not allowed to even mention her name, or even a similar one, considering that my ex feels I left her for her. This is in no way true, Jane broke up with me, and Annie happened to be there and we started dating 4 days later. Annie lives 2,500 miles away and doesn't know this, but I keep our friendship hidden and private, because Jane will fly off the handle at the very mention of her name. Also, I am not a jealous person, I have told Jane multiple times that she should keep her male friends, and go do things with her friend group that she used to do, but once we got serious, she cut all contact with her male friends, and expects me to do the same with my female ones. I put my foot down last night and told Jane that my friends are very dear to me, both male and female, and that if she doesn't trust me, then she shouldn't be with me, and in my whole life, across multiple girlfriends, I've never once cheated, and she knows this. She called my mom on me, and my sister, and everyone is telling me I'm wrong, and that my fiancee is the best thing that ever happened to me, and to keep the peace I should acquiesce.

bc3wun	Okay reddit, so I am getting married in December. My family is huge and my parents are paying for the majority of the wedding, fiancé and I are covering the rest. We made initial guest lists just to get a head count for our venue. I made mine first and it's majority family with a couple friends and like two coworkers, it came out to 102 people. My fiancé saw my list and said he'd have his in a few days. He gave me his and it also has 102 people. This was weird to me because his family is not even half of mine. His mom is an only child and his dad has one brother. My mom is one of nine and my dad is one of seven. We have been together since high school so we've met each others entire families. I started looking at his list and there were over 50 names I didn't know. I asked him who they were and most of these people are extended friends of his parents that he hasn't seen since elementary school and I have never seen them in my life. He also gave every single one of his friends a plus one, whether they were dating someone or not. There is no way I could have done that. I said we definitely need to cut this down as we are paying close to $80pp. He got so offended and says it is completely unfair that I get to invite more guests than he does.Reddit, am I the asshole for thinking that it doesn't have to be completely equal?

amagia	"I am a married woman who was happily married up until a few days ago.  Recently my husband started talking about a new girl at work.  I thought, fine, I trust him, and he has other female friends.  Soon I noticed the way he talked about her was different.  He seemed really giddy, almost like when we were dating.  It bothered me a bit, partly because she is 19 and I am 36, but once again, I trusted him, so I left it alone.  Occasionally when he was texting her I would ask what they were talking about, and he gave me vague answers.  One day I came home and found him talking on the phone with her.  This bothered me.  When he got off the phone I told him how much it bothered me.  I asked to see the messages between the two of them.   He said that they were private.  He mentioned that the two of them had played a game where they guessed secrets about each other, and he gave his word not to show it to anyone.  I told him I felt this was too intimate of a conversation for ""friends"" to be having.  He mentioned that she really didn't want her boyfriend to know they were talking.  Red flags went off in my mind.  I told him he needed to stop talking to her.  He refused, saying he didn't want to lose his friend.  Eventually I decided to let the boyfriend know that they were talking and sharing secrets.   I figured I would want to know if I were him.  He said she had cheated on him multiple times before, and when he asked her about it she denied everything.   After all of that, they broke up.  She told my husband to stop talking to her, therefore ending their friendship, and my husband and I are in a weird space now.  Am I the asshole for ruining three relationships?"

bvj6u1	So my mom and I never could find any common ground. I'm a 21 yr old female, and throughout life all I got was zero emotional support, mostly criticism and invasion of my space from my mom. That left me with significant social anxiety among other emotional baggage that a lot of us carry from (may I say) incompetent mothers. I'm not saying I want her to be perfect, because no parent can be, but I what I am saying that she does not act and did not act like she cared about my wellbeing ever. Now that I'm going through a phase of my life where I'm healing my childhood traumas, I have a wonderful boyfriend and many friends and I choose to keep her distant and not speak to her while we live in the same house. My plan is to move out sooner than later, and I do not plan on speaking to her until I sort out all the things she has done and approach her even though I have a strong feeling that she won't listen and that she is going to make herself a victim. I just need some honest opinions here. I know that shit can happen, life can happen, I may never get to speak to her about that but I'm willing to make that choice because at this point I realize that out of a ton of moments we had together in life, 2% of them were happy.

ch8yr2	"I am from the UK and a friend of mine moved to california a year ago. Since then she has regularly asked me to visit, told me there's a spare bed for me in her house,  told me she misses me etc. Basically I felt a bit of pressure to go visit her. I will be going to a wedding in arizona this year, so double checked with the friend in california if it would be a good time to visit. She said yes, there's lots of room at her place, stay as long as I can, so I booked 10 days. After booking flights, car rental,  visa, all that, she tells me a couple weeks before I go that I will be due to pay 1/7 of the rent, as there will be 4 people in the house and I will be staying for 1/3 of a month. I was taken aback and told her I would be happy to buy her food and treat her to fun days out while visiting, but was not expecting to pay rent, and if this is the case I would prefer to just book my own accomodation as I will have more choice where I stay, my own space, and if it is something I will be paying for anyways I would prefer the choice.  I feel a bit like she just wants to profit off my visit now. She is furious and seems to think I'm telling her ""I would prefer to pay lots of money NOT to stay with you, than to stay with you"". Our mutual friends seem to be taking her side and saying I cant honestly have expected to stay with her for free. AITA? In my mind she invited me and suggested there was a spare bed, if she had menioned rent before I booked I might have been more on board wih discussing it, but waiting until a couple weeks before I go to tell me I'll have to pay a few hundred dollars is not something I'm happy going along with.

bprvou	Throwaway for various reasons, also English is not my first language. Everyone mentioned in this post is 30+.&amp;#x200B;My long term GF (Jen) has got a best friend Rosie and they have been friends for over 10 years. I know Rosie quite well but technically she is Jen's friend and I wouldn't see a reason to see her 1 on 1 without my Gf around.About 2 years ago Rosie was dating this guy Luke. We've met few times all together we had great time and I thought Luke is a really nice guy and I have a lot in common. We do the same sports, we're quite ambitious, competitive and so on. When you surround yourself with  people like that you look at things in more optimistic way. So for a while things were going good for Rosie and Luke but after some time he broke up with her. I think they had different life goals going forward. For all this time I kept Facebook contact with Luke but haven't meet him irl since their  break up (we were both busy...).  Few weeks ago Luke contacted me asking if I want to have a beer or do some sport together and I thought why not. As I've mentioned this to Jen she started telling me that he's an asshole and that he really hurt Rosie. I didn't know that obviously... apparently it took her many months to recover from this relationship. I don't know the details but Jen called him sociopath and asked me not to see him as this would be betrayal to Rosie. To be clear I believe Luke did something bad to Rosie/hurt her emotionally  but i'm not sure If should sacrifice potential friendship  for that reason. Jen is very protective about her friends and can go ballistic in this type of situation.So question is do I 'betray' my friend and meet my mate or do I tell him : sorry don't want to be in touch with you?One important thing is that I don't know what Rosie would think about me hanging out with Luke . It's purely Jen's opinion.	AmItheAsshole	Do you want to be friends with her, or are you just wanting to be involved?	Do you think she would be supportive of her friend?	-1	-1	-1
e5k3z2	"I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.So James came in and was like ""sir is there a problem here"" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like ""OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired."" I started acting real sad, like ""no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee"" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.The angry guy started to backtrack, like ""It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it"" and James was like ""No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service""Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and ""fire"" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences.

danw43	"I know title sounds bad but hear me out.My Dad and I have never had the best relationship. He's never really been around, he has a job high up at some bank so he works super long hours and goes on lots of business trips. Siblings and I were basically raised only by my Mom, and I'm really close with her. We barely talk and when we do it's about how shit my grades are in school that I'll never amount to anything if I keep it up, I try to avoid being around him. As I got older (I'm 16 now), I started noticing my Dad's weird behaviour. I remember a few months ago he came home super late and I could smell a little perfume on him. I didn't really think much of it until he left his phone on the table one day and a text notification popped up saying ""last night was amazing, can't wait to see you again"" and a bunch of cringey ass emojis. I was pretty shook when I saw that message ngl. I told my Mom about what I saw and she didn't look surprised at all. She got pretty emotional which I felt bad about, and told me not to worry and that i should just worry about being a kid and let her take care of the rest, so I just let it go cause I didnt want to hurt her more.So on to what happened. Last night we all went to a big dinner at my grandparents house. During dinner, my cousin was telling everyone that he had gotten a new job at some software company. My Dad took the opportunity to call me out and say I should follow after my cousin, and focus more in school. I just ignored him and kept eating. My Uncle agreed saying how hard it was to get through to young people nowawadays, and my Dad said it's because there was no respect and I never respected him. I was so tired of his shit and without thinking I said back, ""hard to respect you when you openly cheat on Mom and don't even try to hide it"".Everyone went silent, and my Dad looked beyond pissed. He asked my Mom wtf I was talking about and told her that she had spoiled and ruined me. They started arguing and then after a couple minutes of everyone else trying to calm them down, my Mom told me and my siblings that we were leaving and told my Dad not to come home. When we got home my phone started blowing up. On the group chat I have with my cousins they said I was a massive dick for publicly airing private stuff. I also got a few texts/voicemails from my Uncles telling me I ruined my parents marriage and that I should stick my nose out of adult shit. I felt pretty guilty about what happened and apologized to my Mom. She said that she understood my frustration and I probably should have expressed it better privately but what's done is done. I've also gotten a few calls from my Dad but I've ignored all of them. He hasn't come home yet, probably staying at one of his mistresses houses.

My fellow co worker does not even feel comfortable being around this guy alone. I know the term 'Miss' is a polite formality, and typically I dont mind it at all. But today when he called me miss it really set my adrenaline off, and I didnt like it one bit. I later told him calmly that 'the next time you need to talk to me, please dont call me miss. I would appreciate that'. Of course, me being me, I felt guilty for being so harsh regardless of how much I dislike this person, and questioned whether I used it as an opportunity to take a jab at this co worker. But the other half of me tells me I was right because he called me something that made me feel uncomfortable. AITA for being so harsh?

e53bta	I live in an apartment with my husband and kids, and we own an adorable German Shepherd. Recently it was announced they have a new policy - all dogs in the complex have to be DNA tested to help identify people who don’t clean up their dogs’ poop. They have some DNA testing system where they send in the poop and have it matched up with all the dogs in the complex, and then hit the owner of the offending dog with a hefty fee.I’m fine with this, as there are some people (not me) in our complex who let their dogs crap freely and don’t pick it up. What I *wasn’t* okay with, though, was that our apartment charged all dog owners a $30 fee to have the DNA tested. When we got our last statement from the apartment, I noticed the $30 fee added on and was pissed. We already pay damn good money to live in this complex, and I don’t appreciate them tacking on extra bullshit fees. Particularly when my dog isn’t one of the offenders. I’m being made to pay for other peoples’ “shit”, literally.Over the past couple weeks, I have endlessly complained, sulked and moaned to management and apartment staff like you could not imagine about the fee. It’s gotten to the point that employees pretty much clear the lobby every time I come in, figuring “Oh shit, she’s here!” I made a post on Facebook venting about it, that many people who live in our complex saw. I’ve sent numerous emails, vented verbally, posted, etc...and yesterday, it paid off. Yesterday we got a notification from our apartment manager telling us he’ll waive the $30 fee for us.I’m pretty happy and feel that my persistence really paid off.

e6avb1	Many years ago, I was married to man named Mark. 2 years into the marriage, I found out he was cheating on me and got the other woman pregnant. It was a huge blow because I too was pregnant with his child. I was only 9 weeks pregnant and was determined to abort the child and divorce him. He begged me to reconsider, and insisted I give our relationship a second chance, and so I did, albeit reluctantly. I had a very unhappy pregnancy and when I was 6 months pregnant, I learned that he never stopped seeing the other woman. He told me that he was torn and that he was in love with both of us. I wasn't willing to tolerate any of that bullshit, so I moved out and filed for divorce. I wanted him to disappear from my life, but being pregnant with his child made things difficult. I never bonded with the baby , and the baby being his offspring contributed to the negative emotions that I felt. I told him that I didn't want this baby. So when he got together with the other woman, I gave her the choice to adopt the baby, which she did. With that, I officially signed over my parental rights as soon as the girl turned 6 months old (I left the day she was born). When I left, I told Mark that I didn't want anything to do with the girl and the other woman was free to be her mother. I moved to another country and tried to leave that part of my life behind. I met a wonderful man and we got married. He knew all about my past and now we have 3 wonderful kids who are 9, 5 and 2 years old. Recently, my ex Mark contacted me out of the blue and told me that my biological daughter, who is 14 now, wants to meet me. Apparently, his wife had passed away and before she died, she confessed that she wasn't her biological mother. I'm torn. I don't want to meet this kid. It was very difficult for me to leave that part of my life behind. I was depressed for years. I reminded him that I gave up my parental rights years ago and that I wanted nothing to do with both of them. I planned on telling my kids about their half sibling once they were grown and mentally mature, not right now when they are still so little. I told him to never contact me again and hanged up. AITA?

I don't know why she seems to have aged early or why I look younger - I was an alcoholic and a drug user in my 20s and probably deserve to look older. I used to joke that it was payback for her being prettier (she was and still is a total babe).I moved away years ago and we only see each other occassionally. Last weekend I went back to our hometown for the wedding of a family friend we hadn't seen in ages, and I was shocked by her appearance.I knew she used botox, but this was next level. Her face was puffy, her lips were super-plump, her eyes looked different and there was not a wrinkle to be seen. I asked about it straight away and she admitted she'd had her eyelids lifted and ""quite a bit of filler"". I'm cool with that - do what makes you happy.She asked me not to tell anyone and I said of course I wouldn't. But then...Now, I thought she looked weird because I know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.I was absolutely fine with that until she said:""It's probably because I didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.""As a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, I was hurt by that. Without thinking I blurted out (louder than I'd intended): ""Oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers"".I regretted it before I'd even finished saying it, but I thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.My mom thinks she was an asshole for bringing up my drinking. My brother thinks she over-reacted and should get over it. Pretty much everyone else thinks I am a massive asshole.So, AITA?"	AmItheAsshole	Why did you even make this post?

cr8gyi	My sister (28f) and I (25m) earn around the same amount and we live in the same area. Thing is, she is truly terrible with money. Has a huge amount of debt on a flashy car, constantly maxed out clothing store accounts, god only knows how much credit card debt. She also spends a ton of money on eating out, drinking, buying tickets for expensive shows etc. There have been many months in which she could not pay her bills. I’ve ‘lent’ her a crazy amount of money ever since I started working (around 3.5 years now). I say ‘lent’ because I’ve never seen a cent of it again. I know that she has also borrowed money from a lot of our friends and family, who she subsequently avoided and never paid back, either.Anyway, toward the end of last month I got a call from her, asking me for some money because she was short on some of her bills. I’d had an expensive month myself - some work needed to be done on my car, I’d bought myself some computer related stuff and a couple other smaller expenses. I told her no, I didn’t have free cash floating around (true). She was irritated and kept sarcastically asking if I really couldn’t spare the money she wanted ($100). So, the next day she calls again, this time asking if I could please just lend her $50 bucks instead, since it’s only a few things she needs help with. Again, I said no and this time she started swearing at me and saying that I was being cruel to her for no reason. After ending the call, I got a text from one of my sisters friends. She told me that I was being horrible to my sister, since she apparently needed the money for food. According to the friend, my sister had last eaten 2 days earlier and was desperately hungry. I thanked her for telling me this and decided to wait for my sister to call again. She did, the next day, this time asking for $20. I asked her to drop the bullshit and tell me exactly what she wanted then money for. She rambled on about how she ‘just needed to settle the last bit of her cellphone bill’. I said no and cut the call. Again, her friend texted me and asked wtf is wrong with me, how could I be so cruel to my sister. She said that my sister had called her and broken down crying, saying that it was now her third day without a proper meal and she didn’t want to go another night without eating. Well the next day, I got another call from a cousin of ours, whom I trust very much. She told me that she was really worried about my sister, because she had visited them the night before, crying. She had told them that she was starving and I had refused to help her. According to the cousin, she looked so weak and exhausted that she ‘could barely walk’. The cousin gave her something to eat (which she apparently gobbled down) and she left, after crying again because she couldn’t believe that I’d refused to help her.I have not heard from her since this happened. No texting, calling or anything.	AmItheAsshole	How is this even a question?	How did you think this was going to go?	-1	-1	-1
bxtwu4	"Ok full story with context.I am good friends with a couple for around 10 years, the guy is arguably one of my best friends since teenage years (I'm now 29) and the girl I also become good friends with through their relationship. They're getting married and of course, I am invited. The invites come out 1 year before the wedding because it is an overseas wedding and they want to give people plenty of notice. I am single at the time of the invite and I RSVP immediately for myself.9 months out from the wedding, I meet a girl and get with her. It's a relationship with a real spark, the likes of which I've never experienced and my feelings towards this woman are very strong. We are together for about 2 months before I realise I'd like for her to come along with me to the wedding as a +1. When I plan to ask, I'm not expecting a yes or no, I'm not really expecting anything, I'm only mentioning it super early as a ""feeler"" to see if it was A) Possible and B) Ok with them.So I mention it during a phone call with my mate and there is zero pressure in my request, the phone call was fairly quick and I simply asked if it was possible to squeeze her in as my +1. It should be said, that the couple knows my partner. She worked with my good mate for quite some time and they both think highly of her and were (at least to my face) supportive of our relationship. His response was *""I'll have a chat with the lady and let you know.""*2 weeks later I get a text from him saying *""About the wedding, it's absolutely fine if she comes but the final numbers are not due until a few months before the wedding. I'm not trying to imply anything by this, but you two haven't been together long and you never know how the next few months will pan out. I don't mean to upset you by saying that but I'm sure you know where I'm coming from.""*I was bothered by this and I made it clear, by saying *""I understand that you felt that way, but to me the comment about the length/instability of the relationship just felt unnecessary.""* His response to this was then *""Sorry I hit a sore point, There are heaps of people who we couldn't bring to our wedding so you asking me for a +1 with a new relationship was a bit of a surprise. I would have made that comment about any relationship that had been going that long to any of my mates. Every extra person we have adds to what we have to pay for the wedding.""*There was no mention of financial burden of bringing extra people in his original response. Had that actually been the case, that’s totally fine. They feel like I was out of line asking and shouldn’t have. I feel like there was no harm in putting out a feeler and give them plenty of notice. I was completely fine with a yes or no and felt the comment about it being my relationship being an uncertainty (aren't all relationships?) was not needed. Am I the asshole here? Any insight on this is greatly appreciated because it has hurt my relationship with the couple.NTA"	AmItheAsshole	Or is this the first time you've seen her in person?

bfwn1v	Hi Reddit. Alt account here. The title may not have done justice for what’s at hand. Long story short, ex and I have been separated for about 2.5 years from a 3 year relationship. She had broken up with me due to “my mother being too involved in my life and her controlling me”. We’ve kept in contact (being within 10 miles of one another) and admittedly, still loved each other and had everything going swimmingly. She had some hiccups of her own, and I’ve given her advice and helped her in the midst of everything. Recently, I’ve gotten a promotion at work (salaried upper management) and still go to school towards my doctoral. With both of those being said, a lot of my time has been used due to work, research and general school work. I’ve noticed that the amount that we have communicated has dropped drastically. When confronted about it, her response is that I am too busy for her and don’t care anymore. Anything is further from the truth and that is why she has cut her time talking to me. I told her I’d try and make more time. So now the issue is, whenever she wants to go do something, I already had plans made with family members (days prior to her texting me) that I consciously couldn’t cancel or that I was busy at work and couldn’t respond in the “necessary time frame”. Now it’s gotten to the point where she has blocked me from everything.AITA for reminding her that I don’t have that much time available, and that if she really wanted to do something, to plan it accordingly to both of our schedules?(Screenshots can be provided if you want to prove that I am trying to remain unbiased throughout the post)	AmItheAsshole	Do you still have contact with her?

cxtmdx	So the title sounds pretty bad but hear me out. I go to school in the city and we don’t have a lunch hall so we have cards that work for certain restaurants. We occasionally eat pizza and bring it to the park. There is always this homeless man who doesn’t speak much swedish, he says a few words but usually just points at things.He always goes around with a large trash bag to collect plastic bottles because you get money if you recycle them. I think that is great as he earns money and it’s good for the environment as some people just throw it on the ground.The problem now is that he demands it, if you sit with a bottle of water just opened it he will ask for it. He won’t go away until you give it to him, he can stand there for 5 minutes staring at you constantly asking for it before giving up. We see him go up to everyone there asking for it and making them uncomfortable. If I have finished drinking my drink and someone asks for the bottle and I don’t need it I give it to them, but with this guy I really don’t want to encourage his behavior so around him we never finish our drinks or just don’t drink in the park. I hate confrontation but this guy can even walk up behind people and steal the drink they put down on the ground and pour it all out behind them. He is rude and creepy, but still he is in a very bad situation that I don’t wish anyone was in. I feel like it would be really rude to tell him to stop since this is the way he makes money and survives, but he is making the park a very uncomfortable environment for everyone. But at the same time I feel like he is going too far. WIBTA if I told him to stop and he is making people uncomfortable? I feel like it would be an asshole move as everyone else is just dealing with it and me and my friends could just not go there or ignore him, and maybe without asking for bottles he wouldn’t make enough money for food, I really don’t know his situation.

cuxyub	"I lived in a shared house with my ex, his parents owned the house, we rented it.We told them 6 months ago, about our plans to split up and move, they then wanted to sell the house - the house has several appliances and the parents bought them, for the house, as they could write them off.His mum wanted the dryer from the house - I helped bring it down and set it up. His mum wanted the freezer sold, so I drove 250km each way, to get that done.I had asked when we first talked about moving, if I could bring the washer - I asked before knowing where I was going to live. His mum thought about it, then told me that ""Yes, I could bring it with me"".Now, I've been living at my new place since the 1st of August - I can see in my bathroom, that I could fit it in there, but it would take up a lot of space - and I'm not sure how to get it hooked up with water etc. - also there's a laundry available, to people living here (for a fee).So, I figured, I'd sell the washer. No reason to bring it all the way down here, just to sell it anyways.I had a buyer on hand, got a good deal - I figured it'd be nice, because I could then buy myself a minioven, that I really need.I had to ask ex about something practical about it, and then it all went south.To him - and his mum??? I don't know? I'm being rude.I can't sell it, coz I got it, to use for this apartment.   \- Recently, he said something about me being sure, if I got the machine - or if it was just lend to me? I asked if his mum had said anything about it, and he said no. But his mum IS a piece of work, so who knows.So in his opinion, I can't sell the washer - I can take the washer, to my apartment, and use it.I then asked, what if I brought it, and then found out I couldn't have it here, could I sell it? Or would I have to bring it back to the house, or to his parents house? He told me, we would have to talk about it, if that happened.I get that the washer is a gift, and I'm very happy for it. But it's not like she went out, bought me a new washer, for the place - it's a washer we've used in the house, for 2 years. It's stated that it's not a part of the deal, when the house is sold.   \- But is it that horrible, if I sold it? And got something for my new place, I actually need?I wasn't told anything, other than, yes I could bring it with me, coz I had originally asked, can I have it. I know I didn't ask, can I sell it etc. - but I was planning on bringing it when I asked, but the circumstances has changed.The example I was given, for the situation, is that he sees this as ""Asking for the receipt, for a gift, before the wrapping has even touched the floor"".SO, Reddit!

apwyt2	Last night he came home from work and I was in the shower. When I came downstairs he was sitting at the table on his laptop and he seemed really stressed. I said hi and went and gave him a kiss and he said hi and kissed me back but he carried on doing whatever he was doing and didn’t really acknowledge me. I sat on his lap and was like what’s up? He was like it’s just work, so I started to unbutton his shirt and kiss him and I was like forget about work now. He was like Im sorry I can’t I really need to get this done, I was like well it can wait you’ve been working all day. Then he pushed my hand away and was like for fucks sake. I was like what? he was like I told you I need to get this done, do you ever listen? I was like wow...I’m sorry, and walked off. I grabbed my keys and went for a drive. He rang me like 5 mins later and I didn’t pick up so he messaged me saying he was sorry he snapped at me and told me to come home. I dunno if I’m being oversensitive but it upset me was because he knows I’ve been having a hard time recently. I get really low at times and when he’s been at work all day I kinda expect his attention to be on me when he gets home. I know he’s stressed out. He just taken over this company and has a lot to sort out. I know he works hard so he can give me and his daughter the best life possible, and I really respect him for how hard he works but I didn’t like the way he spoke to me when I was just trying to make him feel better. And he’s never turned down sex before so it was just really weird for him...I stayed out for a while and when I got home he said he was sorry. I said it was fine but I was going to bed. He tried to have sex with me and I pushed him off and said I wasn’t in the mood.Was i the asshole for not listening to him when he said he was busy? 	AmItheAsshole	How long have you been together?

bi726c	WIBTA if I (34f) stopped being friends with my supposed best (31f) of 29 years for not going to my wedding?I understand this requires a little backstory. It’s going to be a bit long so here it goes. Here mom used to babysit me when I was 4 and she was 1. Ever since then we were pretty much inseparable until I moved to another state. But even then our parents would drive us to see each during summer break from school. Fast forward to 2009 and her mom had a stroke. She was put into a medically induced coma. BF was 21. I stayed at the hospital with her for 3 days. This lady was like a second mother to me. Of course I would be there. Plus she was like my sister. It was a no brainer. It wasn’t a second thought. BF has to make a choice to pull the plug on her mother 3 days after Christmas. I was by her side at the services. I had her back. I was the only one of her friends that showed up. A few weeks later I found out I was pregnant, in January with my second child. In the beginning of March I found out my dad had stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I scheduled a c-section so my dad could meet his only grandson. Out of 11 grandkids. Only that wasn’t what happened. I had to say goodbye to my dad the night before because he took a fall that Friday morning and hospice came in. Saturday was the day of my c-section. He died 2 hours after my son was born. She didn’t come to my sons birth or any of my dads services. I was at my dads military services 6 days after having a c-section. A few years later she gives birth to her first born. I’m there to talk her thru labor and watch her give birth to him. I was at his baby shower a few days before. She married his dad 7 months later pregnant with her second. I was there for that. I travel constantly an hour and half, one way to see her and her 4 kids. I am getting married in 5 days. It’s a small intimate wedding. Only 7 people invited to the actual wedding and 20 people to the after wedding dinner. She is one of the 7. She was excited at first. But about a week later she has been coming up with crazy excuses as to why she “may not be able to make it” she had 5 months notice. Now she won’t return texts or calls. But she likes posts about it on Facebook. I have been there with her for every huge mile stone in her life. I feel like as we became adults this friendship has become one sided and in light of the current circumstances it really bothers me. I only want her to come to this one thing. That’s it. This is the one and only time I have been married. I want her here for this. WIBTA if I ended the friendship if she didn’t show up?	AmItheAsshole	And you know what?

auzirj	"Some background: My grandfather just passed away at the end of January. He was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. This is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. Here's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him. To be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like I did. Cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral I set up for my grandpa either. Now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that I split the estate 5 ways. This is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:No matter what I shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. If I do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. I can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. The first attorney strongly advised I do this. I do nothing. I am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. This is my second attorney's preferred course of action. But this is not about the legality of the situation. This is about what SHOULD I do and would I be the asshole if I keep the entire estate for myself. Just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. I have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. I could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. Basically, WIBTA if I don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?"	AmItheAsshole	Do you even know what the split is?	Is that enough to cover the expenses of the estate?	-1	-1	-1
abu4ap	"So my boyfriend and I had sort of a weird argument last night. We were watching Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless mind. If you've never seen it, it's a movie about a man gets his memory erased in order to forget his ex girlfriend. During the procedure, Kirsten Dunst's character is overwhelmed by her feelings for her boss, grabs his face, and kisses him. At this point, my bf says ""Wow, she just committed sexual assault"". I quickly disagreed with him. Inappropriate in the work place, yes. Sexual harassment, maybe, but it was (in her mind) a one time incident which she quickly recoiled from once she realized he did not (appear to) share her feelings. BF says none of this matters. ""She grabbed his face and forced him into a kiss. If it was a man, she would have been charged with sexual assault"" While I agree that men have been too frequently looked over when it comes to sexual assault, harassment, and how there can be often gender bias in these situations, I still don't think what her character did would fall under sexual assault for a man OR woman.

dejq34	I’m not going to give too many details about my job, but I will say that I work in a corporate office where the staff is well-paid with good benefits. This one employee (who I will call Stacy) is decent at what she does. However, she takes more personal days than most people, for whatever reason. We have a certain number set aside but they aren’t really meant to be used as vacation days. Stacy called in a little while ago sobbing and saying that her dog she’s had for 10 years died and she was too distraught to come to work today. I remember her talking a lot about the dog being very sick a few weeks back, so I believe she was telling the truth. I said I was very sorry to hear about the dog but that, unfortunately, she had already maxed out her personal days for the year. (Which is true - we have an online system that tracks this). Stacy said she didn’t realize she had run out of personal days. She then asked if she could take a 1-day bereavement period. Now, we do have a policy for death. Immediate family = 5 weekdays off, paid. Extended family = 2 weekdays off. Certain other enumerated  categories of people = 1 weekday off. All of these terms are defined in the company policy and it is very clear that it refers to *people.*  So I told Stacy that her dog’s death does not fall within the scope of the policy. Stacy became increasingly upset and said she didn’t feel the system was meant to be so “rigid” and “oppressive”. She then asked if I could just count this  as a sick day and log it in the system as that. Now, I technically could (incorrectly) log this in the system as a sick day, and she does have some left. But, frankly, I was not inclined to do it. We are all extremely busy and tons of people at the office have a lot going on in their personal lives. They still show up. So I told her I couldn’t do that. I said if she didn’t show up it would be an unexcused absence and that I would be reviewing her attendance record carefully to determine if there were grounds for her termination. Stacy expressed her “disappointment” and “disgust” but said she’s coming in. AITA?	AmItheAsshole	YTA - Does it really need to be stated?	YTA - Does it really need to be said?	-1	-1	-1

I was asked about my support system in the beginning of therapy and I listed a few friends, but every time I talk to them their response to a situation is to just pray about it or go to God and in turn I now feel less supported. &amp;#x200B;For example this morning: Me: My husband gave me the silent treatment after I told him I needed time to think about whether or not I am okay going to marriage counseling where I am not allowed to speak to the counselor without him.My Friend: You can't change him, only God can.

I was driving down a street at around \~20-25 mph(this was a 35mph zone) and he crossed the two yellow line divide in the street to the driver's window. He began making hand gestures to me and swearing. I just shrugged my shoulders. He then smashed my side mirror. I swirved and hit him.I immediately stopped and called the police to report the accident. He began walking up and down the street screaming profanities at me and recording me with his cellphone.

95x1hf	I had a quick question that I was hoping might be able to be somewhat answered here or for me to get a rough idea of my rights, as my lawyer is out of town. I’ve contacted her and am waiting for her reply but was hoping here I could get a general idea of what to expect.I’m currently on short term disability and set to return back on the 20th of this month with accommodations put forth by my doctor. I work in an office that has more than 15 employees but less than 50 in New York State (not the city).With the help of my doctor and my lawyer I wrote up a letter to respond to them asking when I’m coming back and explaining to them that I will require accommodations. It took me sending the letter three times before they finally responded and all they said was that once I started they would “discuss” the accommodations.The HR at my job has no background in HR at all and has shown multiple times that she doesn’t understand some of the duties of HR. She only works about 10 hours a week and is a wife of the owner, so there’s no going above her, he backs everything she says.I was under the impression that we would get my accommodations settled before going back. Is it legal of them to wait until I’ve started back to discuss them? I’m worried they will just ignore them again as they have in the past, and as they did with my letters (all sent over a week apart to give them plenty of time to answer).Thank you in advance!	legaladvice	Is it legal of them to wait until I've started back to discuss them?

d2hw8g	"I purchased a motorcycle for $2800 US in Tennessee from a private seller. At the time of the purchase, I was made aware that the motorcycle had a salvage title, however, I was not informed that it was unable to be registered unless it was a ""rebuilt salvage"" title. Also, the person who sold it is not the person on the title. Her dad had given her the motorcycle which he acquired from a friend. Both the father, and the friend are deceased. The motorcycle has been rebuilt but there is no way to prove it due to both previous owners having passed and paperwork is lost. At least this is what I've been told by the person who had sold it to me.I have tried multiple times to register it with no success. I have also asked the seller to take it back and return my money due to the fact that it I'm unable to be registered. I also have text messages from her from the day I got it saying ""you can always bring it back lol."" They have no intent to take it back and have been telling me that they're looking for the paperwork needed to make it legal for at least a week now. Everytime I ask about it, I get a different excuse.I just want my money back, or at the very least an ability to register and drive it legally, which cant be done unless i can prove what parts were put on it and where it was rebuilt.What legal right do I have? What should my next step be?TLDR: I bought a motorcycle I cant register and the seller isnt helpful in taking it back or giving me what I need to make it legal.

afy09i	Back in September my girlfriend got pulled over and charged with a DUI in Pinellas county, FL.She paid the fees, got her car back, got her hardship license, took the required classes etc etc, basically doing everything she was told to do.  Her lawyer told her he would be able to knock it down to a reckless, due to it being her first offense, no damage to property or people or anything.Today he called to tell her that tomorrow in court she should take the DUI charge, that he wont be able to get it lowered, and she should just take the 'first offense DUI' punishment.He claims that it's because this county is more strict than the one he normally operates in (Hillsborough/Tampa FL) but we're not sure he just doesn't want to do the work.Does anybody have a similar experience or advice for her? We're genuinely wondering what we've even paid this guy for, since it seems like aside from pushing back her court date, he hasn't been able to help her like he said he would.

dgz949	My grandma recently (6 months ago) bought a car from a shady dealership and they refused to give her the Carfax, insisting the car is fine. Turns out it isn't fine, she went to refinance the vehicle and the credit union got the Carfax and shows all sorts of problems. She went back to the dealership and they gave her a different Carfax showing nothing wrong with the car (almost certainly a fake). She went to a Chevrolet dealership and they confirmed the credit unions Carfax is the one they have as well. What course of action can we take? What kind of lawyer can help us? I bought a car in May from a reputable dealer and they made me initial every page of the car fax and sign the last page. They said it's illegal in Ohio to sell a car without giving a Carfax first.

Everytime I have limb cuttings or whatever large debris that I put at the road, my neighbor (across the street) walks out of her house and kicks it in my ditch.

ei8d3a	"Our building (4 units) was sold shortly after California implemented a new state-wide rent control law. About a month later (we're month to month) all tenants were given a 60-day notice to vacate because ""having obtained all necessary permits from [city], the landlord seeks to recover possession of the rental-unit for necessary repair or construction when removal of the tenant is reasonably necessary to accomplish the repair or construction work.""Well, sucks right? Except we recently came to believe that they have not actually obtained any construction permits (none are registered with the city online). And according to the new rent-control law, in order to remove a tenant from a property for repairs the repairs must be significant enough to require permits (or at least, that's my NAL reading of it).Additionally, per the law, they're required to compensate us moving expenses equal to one-month's rent within 15 days of giving us our 60 day notice. We're less than a week from our end of tenancy and we have not yet received this.It seems pretty patently obvious that they just want to kick us out so they can raise the rent on the units. We're already set to move at this point, so my question is, is there anything to be gained from meeting with a lawyer to go after them for this? I'd imagine if we acted right away and had wanted to we could have maintained possession, but it's a bit late for that (and realistically the landlord would probably just actually register for permits and kick us out again).So basically my question comes down to - is a (not free) consultation with a lawyer worth it? Can we sue the landlord for monetary compensation at having been unlawfully forced to move? Or are we just SOL?Thanks in advance!"	legaladvice	What does your lease say?

bkz0gn	"Hey reddit! My company is transferring my gf &amp; me to Grapevine, TX. We looked at a lot of complexes and found the perfect one! A dream-come-true property. Everything about it is more than we imagined being able find. We applied and paid the upfront fees. Our credit and income are more than good enough, we have a flawless rental history, and no known barriers to entry; that is, until we were denied for ""criminal record."" It surprised me that it even showed up in a background check because it was an arrest a year ago, and dismissed. A wrong place/wrong time situation where everyone at a friends' home was arrested without exception. I believe they overreached to encourage everyone to testify against the homeowner, but, regardless, the cases were dismissed. No indictments, no deferred, no convictions - ultimately, only an arrest. The leasing agent explained the third-party background check company listed a criminal record as the reason for the application denial and explained her hands are tied as a result. After sharing the story with her, she compassionately facilitated a dispute with the report with the third-party on my behalf. My attorney provided a written statement to the complex and third-party company explaining the case was rightly dismissed, that there was no indictment, and no conviction. He even provided to-date copies of my criminal record showing no results as well as a copy of the dismissal. The third-party acknowledged this information and replied that they did not report a criminal record, only the arrest record, to the complex. They further provided copies of the FTC's FCRA documentation, the terms of their certification with the complex, and all the fine print I agreed to when I signed the application. Within these documents I found the Qualifications section and read the Criminal Background criteria. This is a copy of the wording, ""If any applicant or adult occupant has a criminal conviction or deferred adjudication, that information will be evaluated under our established policy regarding criminal history.""I interpret this to mean, I am eligible to lease and should be approved. My defense attorney's interpretation is the same and suggested I seek counsel from a civil firm.I believe, contradictory to their own written policy, and terms of leasing, I am being denied for reasons that are not protected under the law; based mostly on my Law &amp; Order SVU degree and Google searches. I believe my Fifth Amendment Right of presumption of innocence is being voliated and I am being prejudicially discriminated against. If that's correct, what should I do next?I wouldn't usually consider fighting to live somewhere if I am unwelcome, but my gf is devastated and insists there is no where else she'd be content living. And I agree for the most part, its really perfect for us. I probably sound righteously indignant, and entitled to anyone reading this. I'm only advocating for fair treatment because I have suffered in many ways as a result of this situation and need to defend myself - it has to stop somewhere.

I've been through a ton of tests, but everything has come up clear, so he believes they are caused by PTSD after my injury as I was having some pretty bad nightmares for a several weeks afterwards. Some days the headaches are so bad I can't even get out of bed, it feels like an extremely bad migraine. Usually it's about once a week when it flares up, but sometimes it's there for 2 or 3 days in a row, and I always have a doctor's note for the days I missed. Recently my boss told me that if it keeps up he will let me go as it's ""affecting our performance as a company"".Can he actually fire me for missing too many days?

dbiqnm	I live in the state of New Mexico, Albuquerque to be specific, My Girlfriend has suffered mental abuse pretty much her whole life but next to no Physical abuse, and yes we have contacted CYFD before and the left her in limbo and her parents put on a fake personality and lied their way through the whole thing and since it was mental abuse not physical, CYFD believed the whole thing. And though she turns 18 next year she is unsure she can handle waiting that long (she’s had trouble with suicide in the past and she is medically diagnosed with depression and anxiety and she has a high likelihood of being on the spectrum, and she has gotten therapy in the past it and it helped, as of late it hasn’t helped and her parents actually us it against her.) and she’s trying to figure out if she can get emancipated via marriage. We are both currently 17 and though we’re young we have been best friends and practically family since the 4th grade. And we are thinking this would be the best route since she can’t fully support herself or live on her own and harboring a runaway in our state is a felony. We can’t ask her parents for consent because we fear of abuse for both her and maybe even me, but because it would usually result in mental abuse for her theres almost next to no physical evidence to prove why we couldn’t ask. We’re at a dead end and don’t know what to do, I hope we may be able to learn something from this post.	legaladvice	Is she still in school?	Did she go to a youth shelter?	-1	-1	-1
8tzlr8	We have a small fleet of a couple straight trucks, a small van, and a couple trailers, and will also be getting a semi tractor soon.  I used to do internal annual DOT inspections for another motor carrier as an employee of theirs, and was trained by the State of Minnesota as a certified DOT inspector (that company had trailers licensed in Minnesota).  Another company that I was with used to pay a local shop to do the annual inspections, and we discovered shoddy work on their part.  So I would like to save money and improve the quality of the inspections by doing it ourselves, but I wonder: does it make a difference in court if an inspection was done internally (and competently) versus having a third party do it, in case of an incident.  In other words, is my employer exposing himself to any more liability if we do it ourselves, provided the quality of the inspections are the same?	legaladvice	What other kind of work were you doing?

b7neq7	"Hello Tl;DR at the bottom, somewhat of a long story. As described in the title I was just discharged from the hospital after going in for jaw pain and ending up with a lot more problems than I ever imagined. I only have medicaid so there are few dentists in the area that accept that insurance and I went to this less-than-stellar clinic on Monday. The lobby was disgusting and staff very unprofessional (think an entire office of people that play music on their phone speakers trying to compete over whose is louder) but I figured it's just a cleaning, beggars can't be choosers, they can't really mess that up can they?It was the worst cleaning of my life. I have early perio so it is partially my fault for discomfort, but the hygienist was absolutely brutal just ripping my gums, tongue, and cheek with her tool. I didn't have a cleaning for years at a time as a kid and that first one was rough, but not even comparable to this one that was within the standard 6 months of the last. I left with severe bleeding and pain, told to come back in a month. After 2 days of pain so bad I couldn't eat I called again on Wednesday and asked to get looked at. ""Gum pain is normal the doctor don't do follow-ups until at least 2 weeks."" I don't think this is an insurance thing or scheduling as they do walk-ins, but I let it go, should've flossed more as a kid. Friday I called again saying I can't sleep at night from the pain, please I need to be seen, and got the same answer which frustrated me so badly I was just calling any dental clinics open and asking if I could pay with a credit card just for an exam to see what's going on. All 3 places told me the same thing essentially go back to where you had your cleaning done, they have your records, and it'd be a lot of money to just come in for us to look and not know what's going on. I called the dentist back again saying I **NEED** to come in ASAP, put me on as a walk-in if you have to, but something is very wrong and it's not typical pain. They said OK SIR then come in next Wednesday during walk-in hours if that's how you feel. Next day (Saturday morning) I woke up feeling like someone kicked my jaw in on top of feeling generally awful. I couldn't speak or even smile without pain so bad that I vomited. I went to the ER closest to me that had a dental unit and waited for a doctor. BP was insanely high (168/98 I believe) and heart rate as well, my jaw hurt so badly the triage nurse didn't take my temp and said the doctor will when he sees your jaw. After about an hour I had started getting dizzy and went to get a nurse. Last thing I remember was my heartbeat feeling very slow and everything went black. I woke up on the hospital floor surrounded by nurses and a doctor that took me to the real ER and not the waiting rooms I was in. I was told I had a seizure but I only really recall blacking out. CT scan showed a terrible infection in the area I was complaining about, no major brain bleeding, but concussion symptoms from when I smacked my head on the ground. ER doc was very cool and said it's pretty unusual to see an infection that deep from just brushing or eating, best guess is someone cut way too deep with their tools during the cleaning, and if it was there already then they should've noticed it.I stayed overnight for observation for the head injury and was put on antibiotics, toradol for the pain, and klonopin for the seizure plus severe anxiety about it all. I have to see an oral surgeon 6am on Monday or I could lose (even more?) bone in my jaw. I can't work for 72 hours just from the ER incident, I don't know if the surgery will prevent me from working even longer because I work at a restaurant it was difficult enough with the pain I had before. If I'm missing part of my mouth I don't think the manager will want me working until it's healed, but I intend to unless told otherwise.One of my friends is a doctor and another a lawyer, neither are involved in dentistry or malpractice, but are encouraging me to consult with an attorney. I really am just worried about losing bone that I don't know if replacement will be covered and I'm extremely angry that the dentist wouldn't listen to my concerns to the point where I'm ill, missing possibly 2 weeks of work, and facing surgery. I've heard it is very hard to prove medical/dental malpractice and none of my discharge paperwork says what the ER doc told me about it being extremely unlikely this was something I did. I signed a waiver/consent to treatment form at the dentist and I'm not sure if I have a case if I'm an infrequent cigar smoker. Does the waiver, smoker status, or a lack of something more concrete mean I should just take my lumps and just find a new dentist?  TL;DR had rough cleaning done, dentist wouldn't see me again, ended up in ER with an infection, fever, and several other conditions but am skeptical to bother with consultations if I clearly don't have a case"	legaladvice	What’s your end goal here?

b4pavr	Hi r/legaladvice,I moved from California to Florida, and hired movers to transport my items the Bay Area to the east coast. The process in getting my things shipped in advance of my move was a pain in the neck, but my stuff was eventually picked up for shipment.  I went through a licensed, insured, and bonded broker who guaranteed that the moving company dispatched was licensed, insured and bonded and certified by USDOT. The BBB ratings for the brokerage were pretty good, and things seemed to be going ok.  The driver called to confirm that my items were shipping from the warehouse the following week, and I thought my things would arrive. Fast forward 4 weeks, and I start inquiring where my things are since they were guaranteed arrival within 3 weeks. No response. I continue harassing them until finally at 8 weeks, a driver calls up to tell me that one of his employees set the warehouse on fire, and all of my things burned. I immediately reached out to the brokerage to ask for confirmation in addition to my renters insurance.  I suspect my things were stolen and sold off, which is baffling because I only packed clothes and sentimental objects, no appliances or major electronics. My question is what do I do next? What platforms can I reach out to to confirm that my items in fact burned and weren't sold off somewhere? My insurance company will expect dates that the loss occurred, and of course no one with the moving company is returning my calls.  The moving company also supplied me with their claims line for redress, but they are not returning my calls either. Per my bill of laiding, I cannot reach out to a lawyer until they have had like 30 business days to address my claim. Has anyone else's moving company claimed to have set their things on fire?

cb1oyb	So I have a weird situation that has been causing a lot of stress the last couple of weeks and I'm not sure what to do from here. I have about 15k left in federal student loans that I've been paying off on a income driven repayment play for each of the last 3 years. Besides one late payment (it was 1 day late and I paid it + the small late fee) 2 years ago I have never missed a payment. I just did a new IDR application in June as you have to update your income every year so they can recalculate your monthly payment. It says it was accepted on June 2nd. My normal payment date was on the 23rd and I had auto payments set up. On the 25th I realized no money had been taken out of my bank so I logged onto my loan servicer website and it says my account has been closed and sent to collections the prior week. There was 0 warning and I have been paying my loans every month.I started by calling the servicer on the 26th, I was on hold for less than a minute after explaining the situation when the person told me it was obviously a mistake and that it would be transferred out of collections by the end of the next week (so by July 5). That didn't happen. They also said they were unable to e-mail me written correspondence admitting the mistake but gave me a reference number. I called back yesterday and gave them my reference number and again they said it was obviously a mistake and it should now be by the end of this week, they refused again to give me written notification, but I recorded the phone call this time. I also have saved and printed every bank statement from the last 3 years showing I have been making payments and I have saved all their e-mails I get with confirmation of payments. I don't have access to the actual loan statements anymore as they were only on my online account which was closed.As of yesterday I got written correspondence and phone calls from the debt collection agency letting me know I owe them the money. If the servicer keeps dragging their feet on this I'm worried about permanent damage being done. What can I do to properly dispute this debt. Do I talk to collections and explain the situation to them too? Do I need a lawyer? I just don't know what else to do, I've never been in this situation.&amp;#x200B;Late add.. I also just got a letter today saying they were going to begin garnishing my wages in a month if I don't request a hearing, assuming I should do that and give them all the information I gave here?

an2i84	I am wondering if I should escalate this and speak with a lawyer. We have been co-parenting since our break up about 5 years ago. I get her every Friday night from school and drop her off every Monday morning. Recently she has moved to a different state, telling me about it a week before, with out any of my input. She has not changed her address with the school so she can continue to stay at the same school. It is a 45 minute drive to school for my daughter now, opposed to a 5 minute drive. My daughter can be difficult to handle some days, and saying she isn’t the best behaved at school is an understatement. Because of her actions this past week, her mother and I will be meeting with the principal and a mental health professional. I am considering mentioning the move during the meeting, in hopes they will persuade her mother to let me take her during the week. Her response was not to do it because she will just end up in the RI school system. My questions are: 1 should I mention this during our meeting. 2 do I have any legal recourse against her for moving to a different state without my knowledge. I still see her every weekend, which was a non legally binding agreement. I don’t have court ordered child support, I just Venmo her every week with what she needs. I am currently working full time and going to school full time so I did not want to contact a lawyer unless I absolutely need to because of financial reasons.

9zrhx5	On mobile so sorry for the formatting. Location. AlaskaGoing to try and make this short and to the point. For the past few weeks I have been staying at a small inn and hostel. Family owned. Not corporate at all. It’s a weekly room. There was never any paper work or lease. When I originally checked in the owner just took my drivers license and a credit card payment. He informed me someone else had the room booked and paid for way in advance so I could only stay for so long. When my time was almost up he told me I was able to stay for one more week because the guy who had the room reserved got delayed. Anyways so I go to pay the rent for the week and he informs me the guy was coming midway through the week and he would just give me the three days and then I had to be out. Cool no big deal. Today is that day. Yesterday I told him I would be out in the morning and he said “don’t worry about leaving early. As long as you leave by 3 o’clock or so that’ll be perfect.” So today I go to work and call him around 10. I told him I would be out between 2-3 o’clock since he gave me the extra time. He then says “okay that’s great. By the way you have to pay me for the past couple nights.” I pretty much just said okay and hung up. So my question is after trying to pay the rent and him telling me he’ll just give me the extra days and not taking my payment then and now he wants me to pay for days past on the day I’m leaving, so do I really have to pay the guy? Hell from what I’m thinking this guy who paid in advance but just hasn’t shown up is probably already paying for the room and now the owner is trying to double up on the rent. 	legaladvice	Did he give you any kind of receipt for the payment?

a6mro6	"So my friend is in the hospital and is in a lot of pain to the point where he can't even eat (which he desperately needs to do according to the doctor) and this nurse was defying the doctors orders and lying to my friend and withholding different medications from him because ""she's been a nurse for 38 years and he's obviously lying and nobody could need that medication or be in that much pain"". She completely withheld two medications and only gave him half the amount of the third medication. When the shift changed and a new nurse came in, she asked him why he wasn't eating and he explained to her that he was in so much pain he couldn't eat and that the previous nurse wasn't following the doctor's instructions in the computer. The new nurse flipped out and was pissed at her colleague for lying to my friend and withholding medication from him. The only thing I could think of was talking to the charge nurse and possibly the hospital's ombudsman. Does my friend have any case for malpractice or is there anything he can do? Is what the nurse did illegal? This is in Ohio btw. Thank you!"	legaladvice	Does he have an ombudsman?	How much pain does he actually need?	-1	-1	-1
9nqwo8	Throwaway because as I mentioned on my one other post here, I’m a relatively popular cosplayer so a lot of people may recognize me if I posted on that account. Title basically explains it all. I am VERY thankful to be living with my amazingly supportive and accepting mom and step dad (I am a bisexual teen myself who has been out to them for awhile). However, one of my good friends hasn’t been so lucky. She was accidentally outed to her mother when her friend made a gay joke directed towards her at an event without realizing her mom was nearby, and since then her life has basically been a living hell. While thank god she hasn’t been abused or neglected, her family is constantly berating her sexuality and they’ve even gone as far as to ban sleepovers and parties and anything else where she can be alone with girls to “try and tame the temptation” as they said.I’m not sure the full story but things escalated to the point where she texted me last night. Her family just straight up kicked her out of the house with just her cell phone, charger, some clothes and a few other personal belongings. I was out and didn’t have a ride but I texted my mom who left work to rush in there and get this girl to our house. We comforted her and let her stay at our house last night.I talked with my mom and she immediately said that she’d let her stay with us as long as she needed it. We just don’t really know where to go from here legally. She and I both went to school today, and the only issue we ran into was the bus driver at our school nearly refusing to let her on due to school parental permission rules. What should we do in order to keep her safe while still being legal? We have tried to reach out to her parents but have had no luck. While currently there aren’t any foreseeable problems, we don’t really know what to expect or do if she needs something like medical care or school papers signed or anything like that.	legaladvice	Have you called the school to see if they'd release her?

The other day when I planned on going to the DMV I realized I had lost my paper work and now I'm not sure what I can do to get my Drivers License updated.  Where should I began?  What can I do?

dya890	"My girlfriend was recently hired as a cleaner for a local hotel in Sherwood Park, Alberta. Two nights ago, I was having severe localized pain in my abdomen and asked her to bring me to the hospital. I was put on painkillers and my girlfriend consented to being my ride in case there was nothing to worry about. At 2am, she informed her employer about our issue and said that she would not be able to make it in to work for that morning. Her employer later responded noting she was upset that my girlfriend could not come in and that ""everyone needs their days off"", but that she accepted my girlfriend's request for the day off.At about 5 A.M, we were informed that I had appendicitis and that a surgeon in Fort Saskatchewan would be able to operate on me that same day. The doctor told my girlfriend to drive us there, due to the fact that a transfer ambulance may take hours to do so.Prior to the surgery, we were informed that I would most likely have to stay overnight in order to be evaluated after the surgery. My girlfriend decided to inform her employer that she would more than likely not be able to come in the next morning due to that statement. Her employer once again was very upset but acknowledged her request.This morning, she was informed that her employment had been terminated. I understand that because she had not been working there for more than 3 months, that her employer could terminate her without cause. What I am failing to understand is whether or not her employer had any right to do so after explicitly stating that her request for time off had been accepted. I apologize if any of this is confusing, but I have ample time to answer any questions if there are any to ask.Thank you."	legaladvice	Does she have a medical note from a physician that has been treating her?

dm9j2t	Hello everyone.I have a month to month l lease that terminates november 30th. I gave notice to quit about 9 days before september 5th, (The monthly payment date) the lease did not have an early termination clause, so I believe that means thar I need only provide a 7 day notice. This monday (October 21, 2019) the property manager contacted me to tell me that they found a tenant and they would like to settle up my debts for rent and services. So, Can they charge me beyond the limits of my deposit for rent? So if the first month that I've been gone is deducts my entire deposit, and that leaves about 16 days. Can they charge me those 16 days? They have not provided an invoice. They also never provided a letter at 30 days detailing my deposit, nor an itemized list of deductions, nor have they provided correspondence detailing an extension to this period.

As of right now my frames vary like crazy and the frame rate isn't bad but there will be times where it feels choppy but will still be getting above 60 FPS. Anyways, I am not sure if that has to do with my graphics card but with that being said, should I get a RTX 2070 (Asus Strix most likely)? I will not be doing any 4k gaming but I will be playing in 144hz, I do not need ULTRA settings but maybe like medium or high and just have a smooth playing game while streaming. Eventually I am planning on just using my GTX 970 &amp; i7 4790k as a dedicated streaming PC but for now I would like to get a new graphics card. Please give me y'alls opinions. I read a lot of other threads but none really related to streaming so I just wanna make sure this will be the proper purchase.	pcmasterrace	At what resolution and graphics settings do you play?

I am a little bit stuck with what Graphics card I should get, so I need some advice.I was originally considering the Nvidia 2060 Super, due to its affordable price yet high performance. I am now starting to think that an AMD 5700 XT may be a better option as it is more powerful, plus it uses free sync (which is what his monitor operates under, and is not compatible with Gsync). Although, I have seen that the 5700 XT has had some issues with Driver tech, which leads me to move to a more ‘established’ GPU, like the 2060 Super.

d538z1	Hi everyone, tryna find out tips/suggestions in dealing with this My average water bill for a 2 family household (NY) is around $300 per billing cycle on average for the past 2 years. However, the last two bills has been $500 (66% hike) and $600 (100% hike) respectively.Now I'm fairly certain that my household did not use 66%-100% more water suddenly. I understand if certain months people want to use more, but 100% is just surreal. I've spoken to the other household and they assured me that there is no significant water usage.Also for reference there's no heavy water consumption appliance in either households such as dishwasher/laundry machine, etc. I've contacted the DEP via phone and formal letter to complain about this and the previous bill, but it seems like they're not gonna do anything. I've scheduled a water surveyor/certified plumber to check the house for any leakages, but is there anyway for me to dispute this bill? Any help/insight would be appreciated.	personalfinance	Did the home owners insurance not cover it?	Did you read the bill?	-1	-1	-1
cw7x1j	I’m 20 years old. For the past 2 years I’ve had a full time job and I’ve lived at home, paid rent to my parents and I haven’t saved a great deal of money before I move out to go to university in London. During these two years of work I also took up driving lessons and I’ve hated it. I sucked at driving real BAD to begin with for a long time. I’ve always had 2 hour lessons (£56 almost every week, give or take about 15-20 weeks) as I couldn’t possibly have gone far enough or learned enough in one hour on the roads in my area. I recently took a test and I failed on something ridiculous, not checking my blind spot over my shoulder before entering a road. Driving has just made me feel so stupid and worthless to be quite frank as I’ve taken this long to learn and I still failed. I feel like I’ve spent too much money on learning to drive to turn back and just quit it. Spending more money is really concerning me right now more than ever as I’m about to move out and I have no income anymore. I feel like driving has stripped me of thousands and left me with nothing and I’m seriously struggling to find the willpower to continue. I’m stressing out big time and I’m feeling like I’ve made the worst decision ever continuing to learn to drive for this long when I’m not even going to need a car when I move to London.

e5onv8	5 years ago my husband and I bought a house at the bottom of the housing market in the US. The housing market in our area has gone up tremendously, and now the house is worth quite a bit more than what we owe. It was built in the 1950’s and we’ve been slowly fixing it up. The problem was face now is it still needs quite a bit more updating including foundation issues and all new plumbing (cast iron pipes).

We are complete beginners when it comes to investing.I have a car loan through my credit union with a balance of $14,500 at 2.75% interest. I have three student loans totaling about $11,000 at 4.41%, 3.61% and 3.15%. We are really good with credit cards and have no debt there.We are trying to follow the established advice of setting aside an emergency fund, then paying off high interest debts, then investing (in that order). I definitely plan on paying off the 4.41% loan immediately but can't really decide if the others are low enough to just keep making payments and invest the rest of our settlement.Any advice is welcome.

c4769d	I currently owe about $80,000 on my 2.875% mortgage that matures in mid-2023. Since I make about $1200.00 additional principal payments every month, I'm on track to pay it off before the end of 2021. As you might imagine, nearing the end of the mortgage, the majority of the payment is towards the principal and very little towards interest (right around $130 per month currently and decreasing quickly). So little interest in fact, that this past year was the first that it was not advantageous to itemize deductions (partially due to the tax reforms).Excluding my retirement accounts to which I contribute the maximum, I have about $140,000 invested in a municipal bond fund which earns about $350 per month, which is then re-invested into the fund. (All earnings on this bond fund are state and federal tax free.)So here is my question - Is there any advantage to pay off the mortgage from the bond fund and then rebuilding the bond fund from what would have been the P &amp; I payments on the mortgage?Obviously, the bond fund income is greater than the mortgage interest so there is no significant financial gain for early pay-off are there any not so obvious reasons to pay off early?	personalfinance	Are you paying interest on the bond fund?

88s5cq	I have about $320,000 in student loan debt from law school; I consolidated my loans (all which are federal Dept. of Ed. loans) with Navient at a 7.25%interest rate. I was paying $688/ month on the income-based repayment plan; my application for renewal was just approved again for 2018 and I am waiting from Navient to re-calculate my monthly payment (I'm not delinquent). As of now, my monthly payments are not even close to covering interest. I graduated in 2013 with less than 200k in student loan debt and it has ballooned since then.  I take home about 6k/ month after taxes. My apartment is 1500/ month (cheap for Orange County), and my car payment is 388/ month. My other fixed monthly expenses include cable ($150), utilities ($80), car insurance ($70), and my current loan payment of 688. After a few other miscellaneous expenses (granted, probably spending more than I should be--for example travelling to visiting my family across the country about twice a year), I'm saving about $1500/ month. Here's my question: Does it make more sense to stay on the Income-Based Repayment plan to qualify for loan forgiveness after 25 years, or should I buckle down and dump $3k/ month into paying off my loan for the next ten years? Any advice concerning how to tackle this gigantic debt is welcome :)  	personalfinance	What is the interest rate on your loan?	Does your job not offer any sort of relocation?	-1	-1	-1
9qwub6	My mother in law asked me if she should take her SS income here in the US early. If she waits until she’s 66 and 2 months then she will receive about 1400 a month. If she takes it now at 63 years old it would be about 1100 a month. I did some quick excel math and it would take until about 77/78 years old to break even on the two options. I extrapolated out to 88 and it would be a difference of about 37k. For additional background she lives with my wife and I and has extremely minimal financial obligations. Just car insurance for one older vehicle. It seems to me that it almost would make sense to just start taking it now as it isn’t a huge impact over time and she wouldn’t rely on it to survive.

I did and after 2 hours, they refused to close the account.  They credited back the first charges on the original card, but have refused to credit these last 3 charges on the reissued card.  They also refuse to close the account.  All of these charges from the old card and to the new card were made in Riverside, CA - clear across the country from me.

Not only do they refuse to accept verification from the bank, they refuse to close the account, and refuse to take away these fraudulent charges.

The nature of job allows for long vacations during certain times of the year and I usually take a month or so to go to  new areas but I always am sure to stop at my favorite spot in the Bahamas pretty much at the same time every year.

95u8bd	First post to reddit and it’s asking for help. I will try to leave names out for anonymous reasons but I want some advice. I’ll try to make it short.I’ve been working for this asian restaurant for over 4 years as a 23 year old Caucasian. I am currently still in college for a year and have no bachelor yet. I have literally been working there longer than any one else other than the owners. I have learned so much and it’s very obvious I have gotten everything out that job. It’s milked for sure. They won’t let me be a manager (even if I wanted) and there is just nothing else for me there. It’s a small family privately owned restaurant so they can pretty much do whatever they want. At this point there is just frustration and dread going to work. The only good thing about it is that I am making good money, or at least that I know of. Each shift is 6 hours and I am pretty much guaranteed $100 walking out cash in my hand minimum. Usually it’s like $120-$150. This is a serving job and I don’t really get paychecks because of how much I make in tips I don’t tip out anyone or anything whatever I make in cash/credit is mine that night. This is because they won’t hire anyone else they like to keep bare minimum amount of workers so I greet people, seat them, take orders, bring out food, bus tables, and do carry out orders at the same time. I would like to think I’m good at my job at this point. I feel comfortable where I work because of the money and my knowledge of the restaurant and food. Now from what I can see there are not any other jobs other than bar tending that can help me make this same amount of money as a college student. I have bills to pay, am married, and I can’t afford to make like half the pay or something like that. At this point I am just very lost and my energy is being brought down every time I go in there and I don’t fit in culturally or just as a worker anymore. Not passionate about the people I work for or the company itself. I doubt there is much advice to give here other than “keep looking”.

I moved to South Dakota a month ago with a job making $13.50 an hour (originally offered $11.88 and $12.46, both of which I turned down). I moved in order to be closer to him after he moved back to his home town, though we still live 100 miles apart. My mother was dead set against me moving because she doesn't believe I can live on that income by myself. I am determined to prove her wrong. Because of this I started reading a ton (both on reddit and the internet) on living more frugal (I was making $17 an hr before moving) and have, in my opinion, worked out my own budget on that salary. It was going to be tight, but I would be able to put a little into savings every month, and would be getting regular raises.

Of this sum, we are earmarking $60K (8 months living expenses) in case we lose our jobs, and 40K for a kitchen remodel this year and other unexpected repairs (House is old... will need a new furnace and water heater soon... a retaining wall is leaning...).. So.. that would leave us $70K to play with... we are very conservative, and never bought stocks. Our initial thought was to put some more money against the mortgage principal (maybe $20K) and gradually start buying some stocks / index funds / mutual funds).. but no additional ideas beyond that (what to buy, how fast, upper limit for investing in the stock market...)Can anyone please share some ideas / thoughts / advice? We feel like idiots for sitting on our cash, but we are still hesitant to act (we opened a brokerage account today, though)Thanks so much!!	personalfinance	What are your other expenses?
