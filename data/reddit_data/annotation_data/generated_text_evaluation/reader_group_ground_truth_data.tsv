8kc90i	Advice	First off, I have no problem with weed because of the benefits that come with it. But my girlfriend wants to start smoking weed to cope with depression, stress, anxiety, etc. (She's also a very talented young athlete). I just don't want her to turn to drugs when she isn't able to deal with things on her own, or even with me. How should I feel and what should I do?

8l91i1	Advice	I work online and last week my boss called and told me that he has plans for me and that he will be increasing my working hours and my bonus rate, then he noticed during the call that I have a cold and told me to drink lots of water and go to the doctor,  so he really is a cool boss.   That call happened,  Sunday afternoon, I didnt mention that I am about to resign.  So Monday morning I decided to email him my two weeks notice, no discussion. just email.  Now, I really feel very bad for two weeks now, I really feel I did something wrong,  because he's really been a great boss all this time and thats how treat him.  He just messaged me through Skype that I just have to work until the end of this week,  I think he hates me now.  So how do I make this right?

8p4uwz	Advice	Was in the midst of a panic attack over some terrible news I had received and accidentally bumped the front of a parked car trying to street park. Left a smallish dent. Since I was already full swing in an unrelated panic attack I drive off. I’m very ashamed and want to make it right. I went back and didn’t see the car. But here is where it gets worse. I have no money to pay this person even if I find them. I’m the kind of poor where I am just barely surviving and struggle to pay my rent. If they want to take it to the insurance I won’t be able to handle the increased insurance bill and I’ll probably just end up homeless. So what the heck can I do? I just want to survive.

8v8mga	Advice	"In other words, I don't know who I am. I suck up the personality of whoever I am around, and follow whatever interests they have so that they will like me. I have a terrible history of not having any friends, aside from those who were just looking for sex, and I think my lack of my own personality just stems from that need to belong somewhere, and how I try to fix it by belonging anywhere.  My counselor and I have both noticed that I have no clue who I am, and I just become whoever I am in a romantic relationship with at the time. Now I am married, and so finally I have been the ""same person"" for a while, but it still causes a problem whenever I am away from my husband, because I feel like an empty shell, and although I don't outwardly show it (it's looked down upon as ""clingy"") I feel panicky like a dog without its master. My counselor told me to try to find out who I am, and I have been trying for about a year now with no luck. I don't know what my question is. I just wanted to post about this somewhere, because it is bothering me.

8vm0a1	Advice	Hey, I’m 19 and a half and I’ve been out of high school since 2016. I haven’t started college yet, mostly because I can’t decide what to do. But now I’ve kind of narrowed down my options and the people I know aren’t really willing to let me know, since they want me to figure it out myself. So I used to do this thing called Mock Trial in middle school and high school. To say I was good at it was an understatement and I have several state championships under my belt. I really enjoyed it too. Which leads me to my options.1. I’ve got a job at a big box grocery store (one of the classier ones, ahaha) and I totally feel like if I went for it, I’d be able to make a career out of it, without having to go to school. This is tempting because I really hate school but obviously the money isn’t great 2. I could become a paralegal. This ties in to the fact that I like law, and don’t like school. It only requires an associates degree. 3. An attorney. Obviously  this requires wayyy more school than the others. I don’t doubt I’m bright enough to do it, but I don’t want to get 3 years into my bachelors and decide I want to do something else and then spend more money on school. But it wouldn’t be worth it if I didn’t get top of my class.  (as many people know there are more lawyers than there are job openings for them)My family is lower middle class, I have no college savings but we don’t qualify for a lot of grants because we don’t suffer. I will probably have to take out more loans than someone who grew up poor due to grants (I’m not mad about this, I understand why it’s done this way, I’m just  taking the brunt of it.) This is why I’m scared about going to college.

8wj2q3	Advice	So the other day my husband of 7 years told me he prefers women with a size B/C cup size. I’m an A. He’s always said he loves my boobs. And he’s never made me feel self conscious about being small breasted until the other day. And he prefaced it with, “don’t take this the wrong way but...” I’m upset with him for even saying anything. Why would he tell me that? It hurt coming from someone I trust sexually. And now I feel weird with him touching my boobs bc all I’m thinking about is how he doesn’t like the size. Is he a dick for saying that? (I think so) Do I just need to get over it?... I don’t know how to handle this.

8xz8hi	Advice	Is it weird for a guy to lose virginity at late 23? Also, is it weird that I only had one girlfriend until now, and dated (for a few months each) about 3 other girls? I did feel pretty bad about it, and my current girlfriend (who I lost my virginity to) makes it pretty hard. If I try to make her feel special and loved, she just tells me that I’m saying/doing those things because she’s my first one. It’s so frustrating because I love her, but I can’t seem to make her feel special, whatever I do. Also, she often snaps and makes me feel like a weirdo because of this, like I missed out on stuff and like I could never make her feel like her previous boyfriends did, just because of this.I’m trying so hard here, but I can never rise up to those standards, because I can’t change my past.

8yb80r	Advice	Over the last 18 months my life has somewhat imploded. Our dog (only 2 years old) had a series of unforeseen medical problems that have resulted in a lot of stress. Currently he’s being kept alive by a load of medication, a state that I don’t agree with but my mother refuses to put him down as to her ‘a life is a life’. But seeing him in the constant lethargic state instead of the energetic puppy I knew is desperately sad to me and it’s something beyond my control.I had a 6 year relationship that ended 5 months ago as I discovered my boyfriend had started another relationship behind my back, and eventually when confronted he chose her over me. To go from a promise of moving in together and an imminent engagement to having the life I thought I would have being ripped away is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. I’m getting better, but the pain does still rear its head.The most stressful thing however, is my father. He is extremely mentally unwell with what consultants believe is paranoid schizophrenia, however he refuses to accept any treatment. He has been kicked out of the home as he has become aggressive and erratic, and that behaviour has become directed at us. We have been placed on a police victim list (meaning we have a dedicated worker as they feel there is a real threat of harm), and my father has taken to stalking myself and other members of the family and sending threats of physical harm to us or himself. This often happens in the middle of the night and the constant looking over my shoulder and worry for him as a human being means that I’ve fallen into a deep state of anxiety. We’re working with the police to hopefully get him arrested and assessed with the ultimate aim for him to be committed in a mental institution for treatment even if it is against his will. There's just a lot of bureaucracy involved so the process is slow.The culmination of these things have spun me into terrible anxiety and near depression. My sleep habits have become poor and I’ve lost a ton of weight due to the stress. I look terrible and often I feel like I’m present in life but not ‘really there’. Unsurprisingly this has bled over into my work life.I go in and perform my duties, I think it peaks and troughs on whether I’m having a good day or a bad day, but I know my performance has been patchy. The main issue though is that my work places emphasis on joining in with ‘office culture’ and being friendly to everyone, apart from a guy my own age who knows about my problems, I’m not particularly friendly with any of them. I’m nice of course, but when they’re laughing and joking with each other I feel like I’m outside looking in as I can’t bring myself to ‘snap out of my funk’ so to speak. It's like I'm watching these happy interactions but my own mind is fogged and I can't think of what to say even if I wanted to join the conversation. I’ve heard in bits and pieces that my boss isn’t too keen on me for this reason, and I can tell that along with some others she doesn’t particularly care for me at all. I will say that the people I am friendlier with seem quite fond of me, but those who I’m disconnected from seem to have little positive feelings towards me. I know this is my own fault for letting my situation get the best of me and I deeply regret that this is the situation and it does make me uncomfortable knowing that people don't particularly like me.My appraisal is coming up in two weeks and at the bottom there is the obligatory box for ‘is there anything else you’d like to discuss’. I’m debating whether to request a brief conversation regarding my personal circumstances to assuage the feelings around it and give them confidence that I’ll make steps to try harder in future. But I know there seems to be a stigma around divulging this type of information at work, so I’m unsure. Is this something that I should bring up do you think, even if it’s just to acknowledge it? I know my boss and others are aware of bits and pieces, but I don’t think they know how deeply it has affected me or how serious it is. Things are finally starting to look up and I’m feeling happier than I’ve been in a long time but I feel stuck in this awkward rut I've created for myself. I’d very much like to be part of the office culture as we are a small team of about 20 people, but I’m wondering if it’s too late to explain and try again. Especially where these situations have been going on for a long time it might be a case of there’s no point in mentioning it as people are too set in their opinions. I’m not in danger of losing my job, but just to increase my happiness at work I’m wondering if it’s a good idea? Would my boss sympathise and understand me a little better? And what could I even say that would remain appropriate for a work environment even if it is a very casual one?

8zx6bv	Advice	This is mobile so bear with me.I am 35, and have been in Tampa Florida for a year. I have an MBA and about 65k in debt from school, but little debt elsewhere, about 10k. For some reason its nearly impossible for me to find a good job! I do everything you're supposed to do: have a great resume (hiring managers have told me,) interview well, dress nice, write cover letters for all jobs I apply to etc, but lack a lot of experience. I have 2 years finance, 3 years Operations management and 1 year insurance sales since college. I did well in Ops management and those are mostly the jobs I apply to.I dont apply to anything over $50k and can't seem to even get interviews. They all want to low ball me at $30-35k. I know I am qualified for the positions but the salaries are always so low it's hard to earn anything over paying my bills. I have signed up for Radioligy Tech classes thinking I can go back to school, earn an associates in this field, and will hopefully never have to worry about getting a job since they are in high demand in the medical field. Anyone have experience trying this? Suggestions? Most likely I'll be over $100k in debt at that point, but can't see the point in working any longer at dead end jobs for no pay.

97r2v1	Advice	Yesterday my brother was followed by a man all the way home. My brother got off the bus stop down the street from our house when he encountered this older man who asked my brother for some change, my brother denied and kept walking. My brother noticed the man was walking behind him normally until my brother arrived into our apartment complex, he turned to see that the man had stopped outside the apartment gate and kept staring at him and then he decided to enter the gate with him and so my brother decided to run home. Once he got inside the house, he told my sister about the man and they looked out the window to see the man sitting at the chair we keep outside and the man kept staring inside the house. He then began taking his shirt and shoes off and began touching himself! Police arrived and they talked to him, he claimed to had “just got out of a hospital and was confused ” and he was also wearing a “hospital bracelet “ and they told him to leave and they watched him get out of the apartment complex and that was it!! This stranger has been seen by another of our apartment neighbors who also said that the man has been acting strangely, We believe he’s been targeting my brother since he followed him straight home and did not ask anyone else for change on the way here. He might be circling the area for a chance to attack.. Anyone have advice on how this man can be stopped??

9ab8qt	Advice	So I used to really love my job. I took a lucrative promotion a few years ago in another department and all was fine until everyone started treating me like less than garbage about 6 months ago, seemingly out of the blue. It caused me to slip into a deep depression and suicidal ideation. Which I ended up going to the hospital for. My boss is supportive of me, which matters, but I don’t want to go back and face each of those assholes who pushed me to suicidal thoughts.  I have severe anxiety about returning Monday. I can’t quit or else I’ll lose my house and have to declare bankruptcy or something. I’ve applied to a few jobs within the company and outside the company and of course that takes time to hear anything back for an interview and to get offers. I’m sort of at a loss.

9c0lol	Advice	Okay, this might be a weird issue, but nevertheless, I'll say it: I'm starting to forget a lot of spelling and grammar rules from the English language, and I'm slowly finding myself forgetting fairly common words and struggling to remember them. I've been having trouble typing lately, and in general, I've been having trouble with the English language. I'm not really sure what could be causing this, but I've also had a lot of trouble articulating myself and explaining what I do. For a bit of context as to why I'm concerned, I used to be completely pendantic about grammar and spelling, and all of a sudden, I can't really remember anything about that, and keep making mistakes, and I used to have a typing speed of around 100wpm with very few mistakes, but now I make mistakes so constantly that my actual speed drops by a considerable amount.

9rbczq	Advice	 We've been together 7 years and 3 months, we both are still very in love with each other. We make each other laugh, we annoy each other, we get excited to see each other after work, we've been there for one another, we're a part of each other's family. We've only been living together for almost two years but before then, I brought up marriage and kids for the second time. He said I wouldn't have to wait long and he sees us marrying one day and once he makes more money. He's made more money last year but so many things happened this year.His sister got married, my sister is getting married, my cousin got married (we were in the wedding party), both were tons of work. His grandpa passed several months ago and then his grandma just passed. So I know it is probably the last thing we should discuss. Although, lately since the weddings and despite the funerals, he's been starting to talk more about weddings in conversation with people. Like what type of wedding we both want, what he'd like, and then yesterday he said to me randomly after dinner that he'd like a diaper party when we have a kid. He never even knew what that was until he attended his coworker's a few weeks ago. He's also been making jokes about having a kid and what it would be like.So he's been talking about it a lot more but we haven't mentioned anything about a timeline since almost 2 years ago. I think now is still a sensitive time. We just got done with the funeral, next we have a huge family trip with my family in Thailand and my sister will be marrying.I'm still in school for my master's but graduate in May so I hope maybe it'll happen sometime next year.

The first time happened in Edmonton at a country bar. We went for New Years and I met a girl out there who I hit it off with quite well. I remember my buddies and I buying shots and having a good time but after about 1 AM I don’t remember anything. I woke up naked and had no idea where I was. My phone was dead and I was pretty scared. She woke up and I asked her what happened. Turns out she asked me if I wanted to go to her place, I said yes and we ended up having sex in her house. I ended up getting an Uber and going back my hotel that was 20km away. The second instance was pretty much the exact same thing but I woke up in the back of my truck. I felt extremely disappointed and gross for putting myself in these situations, I’ve cut down my drink significantly since the second time. I can’t remember if the two girls were drinking or not.

a14mr4	Advice	I’m a 29 year old American male who’s spent most of his life on his own, without any proper guidance, mentors, or teachers. Even now, at this age, I still feel lost and it’s hard not having anyone on my side to talk to, learn from, or to go for guidance as I navigate this crazy experience called life. I’ve tried exposing myself to as much literature and as many ideas as I could, but it still feels so empty because no one is actually there to interact with me. I’ve battled depression for most of my life, due to this “void” and a plethora of other horrible experiences that go hand-in-hand with homelessness, poverty, poor education, and living with untreated mentally-unstable people, but I’m still hoping there some way to turn this around. To live a healthy and rewarding life. As a simple background: My parents divorced very early and I’ve no contact with my father ever since. From what I’ve heard, he’s never recovered from his issues and now lives a life of regret and depression, medicated by alcohol. My mother was never mentally stable during my childhood and her mental illness has progressed now to point she is too toxic to serve her role. My siblings are drug addicts and are also mentally ill. In sum, my family is not a source I can use and I was never in an opportunity where other parents could/would serve.Realistically, this likely scopes out into larger issues within my life or within myself, but I know that’s be something I should handle by seeking therapy.Regardless, I feel as though this cannot continue.

I never meant for this to happen but my partner and I conceived in around December and since the day I found out I’ve felt dead inside, I cannot bring myself to tell my family about it and I don’t really have friends since leaving school. I’m 19 now and have no way of providing for a dependant at this time in my life and my mental health has been a massive issue for me for the past few years now, I know I have to terminate the pregnancy but I can’t help but feel this all consuming guilt for having let this happen and not taking any responsibility for it.

b3n026	Advice	What happens after death has been on my mind a lot lately and people around me have been thinking I'm depressed.  I don't really smile anymore or talk to people as much.  Around Christmas time I started to think about what happens after death and for Some reason I came up with the answer that nothing happens. It would be like before you were born. And that terrifies me. I don't want this to be it. I don't want to cease to exist in the blink of an eye. I don't want to be a forgotten memory.  It's hard for me to sleep at night.  I don't want my loved ones to die and be forgotten.  Suicide has crossed my mind a few times so I can get my answer instead of waiting but doing that would be stupid.

I’m supposed to be at work right now, but instead I’m scheduling my extended medical leave even though I feel no different than I did yesterday. Has anyone else gone through this?

bd2g5l	Advice	My niece has asked my wife and I (wife is 24 and I am 27) to rent out a home on Airbnb for her and her highschool friends (whom I have never met) for the night after prom and the next night as well. It's a beautiful house and it would be a vacation for my wife and I also since we would be there the entire stay with them. We would also be paying nothing out of pocket since they are gathering the entire stay's money to send to me, but they need me actually rent it because apparently you must be 25 to rent it out.I am obviously worried about things getting out of hand and something happening to the house because I would be responsible for the $500 damage charge. Also, they will be drinking while at this house and I don't want to be responsible for that kind of illegal activity. She says it's in a pretty remote location and no one will ever know.

be2eny	Advice	"TL;DR: Friend of almost 20 years is in prison for child pornography and I only just learned why. How can I remain their friend?*Serious answers only, please. I've changed the names, dates and locations on this message and my account is a throwaway.* Back in the very early 2000s I befriended a great guy, whom we'll call Simon. We met online in the (relatively) early days of the internet as we had a lot of in common. In fact, having the same interests was exactly how we got talking and joking on the same forum for particular types of vehicles. The private messages on the forum progressed to emails and then messaging on ICQ, and calls on Skype.We were just about the same age and both enjoyed the same sorts of car modifications and shared our vehicle mods, while making heaps of jokes about each other's lives and states. Just two regular teenage guys mocking each other for fun. As we moved around the country and changed jobs and met women, we kept in touch. I mean, let's be honest, for many guys, real friends aren't easy to come by in this online age and we had so much in common.Recently he confided in me that he was undergoing serious legal trouble and declined to say what it was about. Knowing his character, I assumed it would all be sorted out quickly, although I was concerned. Simon sent me pictures of his home, his wife and daughter. It looked like an idyllic family. I wished him the best, and told him to stay positive.Months progress and I hadn't heard from him, so I emailed him. Days later, his wife responded that he was presently incarcerated in a federal prison and declined to say why. She would prefer that he talked to me in his own words. This shocked me, and I assumed he must have hit someone with his car or perhaps he defrauded someone. I thought the worst, but I knew Simon's character. She asked if I wanted to email him, to which I naturally said, ""Yes, of course.""Prison email is monitored, and Simon was coy about sharing specific details of his situation, and what he did tell me was intentionally vague. I put that down to the monitoring of our conversations and that his case must be complicated. I tried to be supportive and hoped that whatever it is can be sorted out and that you can go home to be with your daughter and wife soon and just get back to work. He was still the same upbeat man, and our emails continued in a friendly, upbeat manner for some months, via the ""Corrlinks"" correctional email service. All that changed about three hours ago and it's been occupying my mind to the point I began to write this, which is becoming much longer than I thought. Anyway, I was explaining to my wife the latest email I sent to Simon this morning, wishing him the best. I wondered about posting him some photos of my new car, seeing as email attachments weren't possible. She asked where the prison was, to which I explained. She began to google it, learning that it's a federal prison. She became curious and googled his name, which has unique spelling. I hadn't googled it, because I got the impression he'd be out soon and things would all be fine. Well, that turns out to not be the case. We found an article from his part of the country, in his local newspaper, showing that Simon was caught with child pornography on his computer - and a substantial amount. More googling and checking the dates, wording of his emails and his wife's email revealed that it is absolutely the same man as the man in that local news site without a shadow of a doubt. He plead guilty in court and is a convicted pedophile.It's been about three hours now and the wind is still out of me. I must have taken heavy, deep sighing breaths two hundred times. I really, truly don't know what to do. Do I give up on a friend who's laughed with me, yelled at my terrible choices with women, and supported me when I needed it? The easy (or lazy) answer is ""Yes!"". And I hear you. In fact, my first response was to cut all contact because he's tarnished and I don't want to be associated with such people. BUT...I want you to try to imagine you were genuinely in my shoes. No, really. Take a moment. Imagine that one of *your* friends - pick one (such as the last person you shared a coffee with, or a beer with on the weekend just gone). Now, imagine THEY did what my friend did. You've been friends for almost two decades to someone who did what my friend did, by all accounts only in the last two years. Change Simon's name for theirs, and imagine *their* partner sending you the same kind of email I received. So, Peter or Kate or Dave or Jeff or *whoever* your friend's name is, did this terrible, terrible thing. Can you throw away their friendship. Especially when they need it the most. If the answer is yes, then it seems I've lost a friend and they did it to themselves. If the answer is no, then *how do I keep a friendship with such a human being?*His prison emails are still full of humor and jokes. It's the same old Simon. But it's not.There's a lot of made-up nonsense on the internet, written by teenagers with nothing better to do, but I don't have time for such nonsense. I'm early 40s and in a real pickle. I truly have no idea what to do and I'll be reading your answers with interest. Please, save the jokes for another day."

bi10jn	Advice	Hi all. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Some background: I (17F) have been babysitting since I was 12, and have been babysitting for this particular family, which consists of 3 kids (currently ages 3, 6, and 9) since I was 14. I adore the kids and the family. I babysit for them often, even staying over night a few times.Where I live, according to care.com, the rate is about $14.50/hour for all the things I do as a sitter (keep the kids ofc, clean, drive kids around, homework help, cook, give baths, etc.), and i always charge &amp;10/hour, which I think is fair. On to the situation. The mom reached out to me asking if I could keep their youngest all day when they take their oldest to the beach to celebrate her birthday. She asked me to come at 7:30 AM and estimated they would be home around 9:30 PM. So, 14 hours. I agreed. So the day comes (yesterday), and I show up at 7:30 and it turns out I’m keeping both of the youngest kids. Okay, no problem. Wish I knew before hand, but, no problem. The mom told me he would be with the neighbors a lot throughout the day (his best friend lives there). The middle child was also already awake when I got there.Throughout the day, I spent about $17-ish dollars of my own money on them, as they didn’t leave any spending money (despite that all their suggestions of what we do with the day included going out and spending money). I honestly didn’t mind though because I figured I would get paid adequately. I made sure the kids had a blast, we went to the park, got donuts, went to the play place at chick fil a, played outside for hours, etc.. The only times that the middle child spent any time with the neighbors, it was in the front yard and I was monitoring (unlike the mom said). I think it’s also important to note that the 3 year old is kind of going through a “terrible 3’s phase”, and she has been very difficult and defiant lately, which makes things quite difficult. The parents know and acknowledge this). After giving them a bath (not to mention we used a bath bomb I bought them) the kids finally went to bed at 8:30. I cleaned the house till 9:00, and they got home around 9:30. They were very appreciative like always. The mother wrote the check, folded it in half and gave it to me (she normally did this). I left, and when I got in my car I noticed I only got $100. That’s $40 less than what I expected for working for 14 hours. This has happened before with this family. There have even a couple of instances where they would underpay me like $10-$15, but I always let it go because although they aren’t poor, they defiantly aren’t rich. Another very important factor is that the mother is my moms co worker, which is how I met the family in the first place. They both work at a preschool, and they are good acquaintances. I don’t want to just never babysit for them again, because they are where I get most of my money because they ask me to babysit so often. It would be a huge toll if I stopped. I also have to be delicate because I wouldn’t want to make things awkward for my mom at work. I want to address this, perhaps over a text message because this is our main form of communication all the time. What the hell should I say???

ca9as8	Advice	Hello Reddit, I’m looking for some kind of reference on what I should do with my relationship. I’ve been with my wife for almost ten years. I’m knocking on the door of thirty, I just don’t know how we lost our spark. I’m adamant about pleasing her when we do (rarely) have sex because that’s what I like best about it. She hasn’t initiated any physical contact outside of kisses hello/goodbye for almost 6 years. It’s gotten to a point where I’m having trouble with the level of damage it’s doing to my self esteem. Recently I’ve lost sixty pounds and have reinvigorated myself my stamina and am still losing working on losing weight. I’m focusing on it mainly for my health, but also thinking it would be something that she would respond to, so far, no luck. The responses I get towards intimate attempts are mostly straight no, with an explanation of something like an excuse, she does have fibromyalgia, I understand that, but she hasn’t done anything to make herself better literally nothing. So if it’s fibro related I don’t look to far into it. What’s worse than a no is a *sigh* okay. This has been the narrative for six years. Only once in the past six years has she made it really seem that she wanted me. This as well as other behaviors has put me in a spot where I don’t know what to do. We’ve done counseling till it got to intimacy and we stopped going altogether.  I’ve talked to her about this several times it just continues to get worse. I don’t know what to do at this point.

cap41i	Advice	 My fiancé got super drunk last night. Him and his brother were talking/arguing over a fight they had a few years ago. He was very drunk, crying, so I said it was time to go home. When we reached our home I insisted I will take our baby daughter out of the car as he could barely walk anymore, with me pushing him out of the way. He slapped me lightly which angered me. When we got inside the house our dog made a mess everywhere. He started cleaning it but I insisted I take over because he had stepped on it, all over his feet. He immediately said “let me do it or ill hit you” me being angry and annoyed about him being stupidly drunk, i said “do it!” Then so he did. He slapped me hard in the face. Then I grabbed my daughter and went to the bedroom. He came in and I begged him to sleep downstairs because he might trample our 9 month old daughter and he punched my bottom really hard that I cried in pain. I tried to leave the house, I really wanted to leave but my daughter was crying so hard from exhaustion as it was already 1am. So we ended up sleeping in the cold basement. In the beginning of the relationship, I would say I was the abusive one because I would always argue with him going out with his friends. I was a teenager and he was my first real boyfriend. I would hit him when I’m angry which I know, was never okay. However, I only hit him out of frustration. Also I didn’t think I could inflict pain as I am only 4’11 and he is 6’4. But my point was, I hit him before and now it’s karma for me?We always argue about the stupidest things. And I know that we don’t get along because we are always having little arguments everyday. When he gets drunk, which is like every week. Most times he just passes out. But sometimes, he could get violent and start calling me names or grabbing me by my shirt. We’ve been together for 11 years. Since we were 16 years old. We are getting married next month, big wedding and very expensive! I dont know what to do. He is a very loving when sober and a very good father to our daughter. He just txted me saying he didnt know what he did last night and that if I could forgive him.

I decided to find a good price on it but everything was on Ebay and expensive because it was a great old game.

Quote un Quote: ""I proud of you. I'll buy you something. What do you want? I'll buy you anything: Toys...(And more examples of what I could buy)."" I couldn't believe it. At first I wanted to buy a nintendo switch or a google stadia, but I didn't know how to get any games on them for free after I bought them.  He said we could go to target(This was a few days after he told me i could buy anything) and I first set my eyes on the nintendo switch. He looked at the price and was astounded. Quote un Quote: "" What? I can't buy this!!"" We argued more and I broke down in the store(I cry very easily). Then at home I showed him the price of the google stadia, which was $129 and came with the same response. A few weeks later we were going to Disneyland and he said I could buy something cheap there. I refused my urge to buy the stuff tourists buy there since my eyes were set on a videogame, ""Fallout."" After Disneyland he said I could have a budget of $50. I asked him to buying $51 worth of steam games since I always had got the trashy ""free to play"" games on there. He denied me. I then decided to buy JUST the first two fallout games and they seemed awesome. They were expensive, as said before, and both games were $51 in total. I didn't wan't to get an answer of no this time. I wen't as far as watching a dumb video to persuade people. He denied me again. &amp;#x200B;Lastly, today I asked him what i had to do for him to buy it. He told me to do 100 math questions on this dumb scootpad thing, which gives you algebra problems multiple choice.  The dumb scootpad thing doesn't even track whether you get the problems right or not;It just checks how many you've completed. Even though I knew this, I still actually put my head to trying to get the answers correct.&amp;#x200B;Guess what he said afterwards. DENIED.

As a result, at home she often speaks badly about D and has been creating a villainous tyrant narrative about D, painting him in a light which makes him look like he ran away from the whole family - often using pronouns like ‘us’ or ‘we’ when describing the rest of the family which seems unhealthy to me. She often sends D intensely threatening or guilt-tripping messages, which I believe is emotional abuse. After blocking M on whatsapp, D still receives emails and texts from her telling him never to come back to the house which he owns half of. Last night he was telling me about how her psychotic behaviour genuinely makes him feel like one day she might come to his flat with an axe. M’s house has had 2 major floods due to burst pipes in the last couple years, each flood costing a significant amount of time and money. The last flood was 3 months ago, and yesterday we were nearly back to normal again after repainting walls etc. Last night we had another burst pipe which was a complete nightmare to put it short. I left for D’s house which is where I am now. D has had a new partner for a few months whilst M has refused to move on. She has grown more addicted to smoking and drinking although she adamantly denies it and says she feels that I’m overly critiquing her when I bring it up. M was in a real state when the last flood happened; I’m very anxious to how she will react to this one. In general I am concerned for her mental health as it’s been a tough year for her. However I am also equally worried that she might show spontaneous or dangerous behaviour as a consequence of her emotional bitterness; she has had complete mental breakdowns in front of me which I think affected me mentally seeing my Mom breakdown without anyone else there. Sometimes I have thought about calling social services or some authority as I often feel alone and helpless in these situations, but I always tell myself that we have a quite stable financial position and that I don’t really want to see my Mom taken away or anything because she was a normal and nice person before all this happened.As for now I am about to go back to school but I live in the fear that something terrible will happen very suddenly. I genuinely just don’t know what to do about any of this and I feel helpless to an extent.Thanks for reading this, please can someone suggest a plan of action.

cwr5bn	Advice	So I'm 16 years old and I've known since the third grade that I want to be an actor. And I'm aware of what this means. I have fully accepted how unlikely success is and how much of a starving artist I'll be. But acting is the love of my life and if I passed it up I would be giving up my chance for happiness. My dad understands this. He tells me all the time that God has a plan and I'm destined for great things, but anytime I talk about acting around my mom she's very against it. I plan on auditioning for a boarding school that I'd stay at my senior year of high school and try outs are rapidly approaching. I've brought the school up to her before and she hated the idea, saying I'd be missing out on my senior year experience and she doesn't want be to be away from home.  I love my mom SO much and she is an AMAZING, AMAZING mother. I am so scared of letting her down and I just have no idea how to tell her, because I am very determined to get into this school. Any advice is appreciated and God bless &lt;3&amp;#x200B;tldr: i want to go to a boarding school for acting my senior year, but my mother is against me pursuing acting.

Earlier yesterday morning I got the call from my uncle that she is being moved to hospice and they're not sure how much longer she has.I feel so devastated. This woman raised me. My own birth giver was an abusive person who allowed me to be molested at a young age. My grandma fought for custody of me and won and raised me as her own. This woman IS my mother in all sense of the word. I stupidly followed my daughter's father to a different state and haven't seen my grandma since before I got pregnant. She was so excited to be a great grandma and now my daughter won't even get the chance to meet her unless it's by a miracleMy own birth giver, her daughter, won't visit her. (This is also the woman who called my daughter a ""mistake"" and an ""overdue abortion""). My uncle (her only son and I guess the only person who can make those decisions) is guilt tripping me and telling me I need to come now because my grandma is wanting me there.I don't even have enough spare change for the bus to get to my two week post partum appointment. My daughter's father is becoming more possessive over the car and his money and his drinking has increased to the point of being almost abusive(please dont tell me I need to leave him. I know I need to and am working on it.) So I know he won't agree with me taking Victoria and going to see my grandma. He thinks it would be a ""waste of time"" to see a dying woman before she passes, even though my daughter's pediatrician said it would be okay to travel with her. He refused to let me use his car or even buy us a bus ticket. He has been so mean and almost cruel about it all. I don't know. I just need to get this out. I'm so sad. I've been crying on and off since my uncle called me. I don't want my grandma to die. I thought she had way more time than this. I wanted her to meet my daughter and I want to say goodbye to the woman who I consider my own mom. I just feel so awful about it all. I don't know what to do.

cz4tds	Advice	My bf (23) said that I (24) was suffocating him yesterday. We had a serious conversation about our relationship and told me that i was doing way too much. He said the constant contact made it hard for him to miss me.  He also said that I’m getting clingy.But the thing is, none of the things i did were meant to be clingy. I would text him an inside joke or something just to be funny, not to suffocate him. And he tells me that it came off as needy.  I thought that i was being comical and never thought that it was like that.  It hurts to be told that because he’s always telling me that i should open up to him and stop being so closed off. And now that I’ve been talking about my feelings (That’s still a work in progress), and being more emotive, I’m being needy and clingy. I honestly don’t understand. He also mentioned that we aren’t on the same page career wise. He basically has his career set, while I’m still working on mine. I work full-time at a job with full benefits at a company where i can grow. I’m also a full-time student going for a degree where I’ll make at least $65k to start. I believe he’s going down the work experience route, while i go down the degree route. I think there’s nothing wrong with what I’m doing, we’re just going down different paths.Our one year anniversary is in a few days, and i should be happy about it, but now i feel some type of way.  I’m gonna back off a little and stop texting him as much. But i have a feeling that he’ll ask me if I’m mad at him or something because of it. But I’m literally giving him what he asked for 🙃🙃🙃After we talked yesterday, everything was fine, but i still feel some type of way about it. I didn’t say anything in the moment because i was so emotional and couldn’t think straight. But now that I’ve had about a day to process it, this is what I’ve been thinking. Being told you’re suffocating is hurtful. So I’m gonna back off and not be suffocating, i guess. I’ll keep you guys updated on what happens.TL:DRBf told me that i was suffocating him, though i thought i was being cute and funny and didn’t think anything i was doing was really that clingy, and that basically our careers goals/paths are going in different directions, but he doesn’t want to break up with me.So any advice?

Every one of us is a white male.When my girlfriend was job hunting a few years back, she made comments about how some people hinted things like ""this job isn't for women"".  So I figured ""How hard can it be?  All I have to do is not say no to people based on their race/gender.  It's easy"".Every time we hire a new person, we get 3-5 applicants, and so far they have always been white males.  We interview them, and hire the best candidate.  I don't know how to get more diverse applicants for future positions.  Most recommendations are word-of-mouth, so the applicants are usually very similar to the person who recommended them.I'm worried that if we continue our hiring habits, that we will dig ourself into a rut where someone who is different from us won't feel welcome.  Nobody likes to be the only person in a group who is different.  I want to focus on this now while we're small so we can grow naturally inclusive in the future.

I don't even know where to go to get help anymore. I am at a loss. I've been clinically depressed for 5 years. I can barely get out of bed. Therapy isn't working and has never worked (tried all sorts of therapy and counseling, the most recent was CBT) and I tried changing therapists to see if that was my problem. Turns out it's not a therapist problem, it's a me-problem. I'm also medicated but meds don't work eiter. I have tried countless treatments during these 5 years of absolute hell. Prozac, Xanax, Citalopram, Zoloft, Hydroxyzine, Venlafaxine/Effexor, Duloxetine/Cymbalta, Latrimogine and that's just a few. Nothing seems to be working, absolutely nothing. I tried changing my diet and habits, I tried eating only healthy foods and going out more often but it honestly made me feel even worse because that sort of lifestyle needed more efforts from me and I just have no energy or motivation for that. I tried meditation but it's useless for me. Nothing, nothing ever works and I'm tired. Even writing this post felt like a huge chore and it required tremendous effort because I just can't find the right words and I feel like no one will care or no one will be able to help me anyway. My worst depression symptoms are the emotional numbness and boredom. I never do anything because I never feel like doing anything. I am not in the mood for doing stuff. I am completely apathetic to the things I used to like before. I can't get into new interests either because nothing really holds my interest for more than 5 minutes nowadays.

The trip organisation isn't that good.So, today we're in a small bus. 16 people. Our group consists of 8 people. The other 8 people included the driver and one of our professors.So my best friend is a real talkative person. And she likes to blabber on and on... And she likes to be really social... Since its a long journey, she had entrusted her snack bag to us. And due to unfortunate circumstances, she was shifted to a different car/vehicle. So we kinda snacked on some of her stuff. She doesn't have a problem with it tbh. She loves to pamper us..But as i said, shes social.

This food was for everyone! How can you eat everything all by yourselves you bunch of thieves!* And stuff. In front of everyone. All the while, she was taking it rather with a chill. Like laughing and having fun while saying this. Ofcourse she didn't mean any of that. But my other friends took it seriously. And now they're really pissed at her. Two of them especially were in a pissy mood when this happened, and that kinda elevated the situation. So they're like *I'm not gonna eat anything that she gives.* Or *I'm never eating anything she cooks*., Etc etc.I dont know if they're really serious about this.. cause as i said, shes a sweetheart.

9dtuzi	Advice	"I could really use some advice on this. I'm at a loss. Background: My husband goes by nickname he was given about 15 years ago by some guys he would hang out with (party buddies) in his early 20s: Columbia. He's Colombian. When we met he introduced himself as this. Everyone he introduced me to called him this. When we got to know each other I found out his name is Antonio.  He insisted that Columbia is his middle name and that he hasn't used the name Antonio in over 30 years. I found this to be untrue, his family calls him Tony (as do many older friends) and his birth certificate doesn't have that on it. Regardless. I respect his wishes for what he wants to be called despite the fact that I really like his ""first name"". He insists everyone call him that name. Before I got pregnant my husband and I would lay around and talk about baby names. Some were silly, but it was fun. He said if he ever had a boy he wanted to name him Columbia. Our second is a boy. Right when we found out the gender, he stuck with the Columbia thing. I said no. That caused a fight. He thought it was selfish that I knew it was important to him and I say no. For months, we danced around the conversation. Anytime I would bring it up he had some excuse for postponing it. I compromised by saying Columbia could be the middle name. We never really had the names nailed down but basically we agreed on Antonio Columbia ""Jr."" As soon as I went into labor and was admitted to the hospital he was announcing the name Columbia to anyone that asked. He had it written on the birth board and crib card. It was infuriating. I was in labor and didn't want to deal with this. I followed up whatever he said with, ""we haven't decided yet."" When he came out my husband kept demanding that name. I kept saying no so he left. He went home and dismissed his parents from watching our 6 year old. I was really heartbroken and torn. When he came to pick us up the birth certificate was blank. We sat there bickering back and forth and finally I said here, have your way name him Columbia! My husband must have felt bad and we ended up naming him Antonio Columbia. The first night home I put a picture on Facebook with the name ""Tony."" My husband flipped out and said he's not going to be called Tony. He hated being called that and wanted it removed and for me to tell my family not to call him Tony. So I call him Ant or Antonio. My family as well as his calls him Antonio. Sometimes he would say something but usually he yells the name Columbia while talking to our son so everyone can hear. Whenever people ask the name he would answer first and say Columbia. It wore me down. I stopped chiming in.  I usually call my son baby boy or Buddy. I hate fighting over it. 2 years later, my husband got more stubborn and gets angry when people call him Antonio. He will say it's not his name, he's not going to use it, why can't people respect his wishes, and so on. He does NOT care how I feel about it. He doesn't care how our families feel. He says he is going to insist that our son's teachers call him Columbia. I'm dreading the day I enroll my son in school or meet with any teacher.My husband is my best friend, I love him. This is causing a lot of resentment and issues. I probably could have done a better job at asserting myself but this is where I am. I have tried many times to get him to see my point of view and gain some empathy as a parent. Nothing. If I call him Antonio, we fight. If anyone calls him Antonio he bitches to me about it relentlessly. Do I divorce him for this? Am I being irrational at all? He's open to counseling but we have different schedules and going through a tight financial situation so we need to hold off for now. Tldr; my husband wanted to name our son (in my eyes) a ridiculous name. He refused to budge and although it is my son's middle name he insists everyone call him that. Anything else causes fights and anger fits. He doesn't care about my opinion. Other than this he is my best friend. Where do we go from here? I'm going to add that he has always been a stubborn person. There are certain things he's set on and will fight me on. But for big things and decisions we can usually find a compromise. Except this. I have sat him down on multiple occasions and tried to talk about it but he will not budge. When I was pregnant he insisted on the name and was stubborn but we seemed to agree on Antonio. When people asked he would say Antonio Columbia. The minute I was admitted he started with this. I was really upset that he got so angry over ""Tony."" According to him, he hates the name Tony but likes the name Antonio. He just doesn't use it and neither will our son.

It was not spontaneous, he had been discussing it for a year before. Since then they have been trying to reach a divorce settlement agreement but progress has been slow and costly, in part due to M’s lack of co-operation as she is taking a long time to accept what is going on. She remains relentlessly unforgiving and angry.M is still very bitter since D left. As a result, at home she often speaks badly about D and has been creating a villainous tyrant narrative about D, painting him in a light which makes him look like he ran away from the whole family - often using pronouns like ‘us’ or ‘we’ when describing the rest of the family which seems unhealthy to me. She often sends D intensely threatening or guilt-tripping messages, which I believe is emotional abuse. After blocking M on whatsapp, D still receives emails and texts from her telling him never to come back to the house which he owns half of. Last night he was telling me about how her psychotic behaviour genuinely makes him feel like one day she might come to his flat with an axe. M’s house has had 2 major floods due to burst pipes in the last couple years, each flood costing a significant amount of time and money. The last flood was 3 months ago, and yesterday we were nearly back to normal again after repainting walls etc. Last night we had another burst pipe which was a complete nightmare to put it short. I left for D’s house which is where I am now. D has had a new partner for a few months whilst M has refused to move on. She has grown more addicted to smoking and drinking although she adamantly denies it and says she feels that I’m overly critiquing her when I bring it up. M was in a real state when the last flood happened; I’m very anxious to how she will react to this one. In general I am concerned for her mental health as it’s been a tough year for her. However I am also equally worried that she might show spontaneous or dangerous behaviour as a consequence of her emotional bitterness; she has had complete mental breakdowns in front of me which I think affected me mentally seeing my Mom breakdown without anyone else there. Sometimes I have thought about calling social services or some authority as I often feel alone and helpless in these situations, but I always tell myself that we have a quite stable financial position and that I don’t really want to see my Mom taken away or anything because she was a normal and nice person before all this happened.As for now I am about to go back to school but I live in the fear that something terrible will happen very suddenly. I genuinely just don’t know what to do about any of this and I feel helpless to an extent.Thanks for reading this, please can someone suggest a plan of action.

9ozw0y	Advice	You’re in your twenties, the world is your oyster, and you are loving life. You meet the guy that might be THE ONE and spend a few years together just being young and in love. You don’t have much money but you’re getting by and you’re happy. You have a tiny two bedroom apartment and slowly decorate it together to be not just your apartment but OUR apartment. It feels like everything is falling in to place. You get engaged and start wedding planning. But then it hits you that what you are most excited for isn’t the wedding, it’s the family. You want a baby. Every time you pass the little park a few blocks away and see the moms with their children playing, every time you spend time with his sister and her beautiful daughter, and every time you see ANOTHER pregnancy announcement on Facebook.. You wish it was you and your heart breaks just a little more. The realization that you and your fiancé couldn’t afford to start a family is like a little dagger to the heart. You could possibly budget enough to make it work once the child started school and you are both working but there’s just no way it could work during those first few years before preschool. You’d really want to stay at home with the baby to be there for all those precious moments, not to mention daycare is expensive, but you definitely couldn’t make it on one income for a family of 3 in an expensive city. Does that ring a bell for any of you? That is where I’m at right now. It’s honestly causing some depression and I have to remind myself that I’m still marrying the man of my dreams next year and I should focus on that. Has anyone else yearned for a child before you were financially ready? What did you do? Did you start a family anyway and struggle to get by or did you wait years for more financial stability feeling like life was missing something. Any advice is appreciated.

csxq5k	Advice	The commute is absolutely horrid, it takes about an hour and a half to get there and its even worst coming home from college. Our classes start from 7am and usually ends by 4 or 5pm, so that means I get home around 7pm. The stress added from a day at school and the rush hour from the commute drains me so much that I don’t even have the energy to study at home. And rest is not an option for me, I’m currently in a scholarship program that I passed through my entrance exams but that’s only good for the first term. In order for me to qualify again I need to maintain my grades around 3.5-4.0 for the next remaining terms. I can’t afford to stay at a dorm nor my parents can provide me in one because we’re struggling financially. And if I’m being honest the learning environent of my college sucks, its toxic to the point where people criticize you openly for the little things they found odd. Just a while ago some jackasses from the back make some snide comments because one of my classmate got a perfect mark on their pop quiz, CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT. I’m definitely gonna work on transferring to my desired college but idk how to cope up with these problems.

cqv8vd	Advice	None of my friends or family know how I feel because I'm too stubborn and prideful to admit that I think I've made a mistake. I've been studying the Japanese language for six years now and I did multiple student exchanges throughout highschool, so going to a 4-year university in Japan seemed like the next step towards fluency. I was accepted into my dream school in Tokyo back in February and, at the time, I had zero doubts. But now my move in date is a month away and I don't think I can do this. It's not the language barrier that I'm afraid of. It's leaving all of my friends, my entire family, favorite snacks and familiar places that I'm afraid of. Really, really afraid of. I have a few friends in Japan from my exchanges, but I'm not close with any of them at all. It's really difficult to get close with Japanese people as an American because of cultural barriers. I know that I'll meet new friends in Tokyo, but I'm scared of not having as close of a relationship with them compared to my friends back home. I know I'm going to feel incredibly lonely and isolated. I already do as is. I have struggled with manic depression my entire life and I fear that I'm going to kill myself while I'm there. The closer it gets to the date of my flight, the more upset and nervous I get. My parents tell me that I can come home from school any time if it gets to be too much, but I'm so stubborn that I know I won't. Even if it means I have constant suicidal thoughts for the next four years. I don't know if I can do it. How do I cope with this? Who should I talk to? What would I say? Am I being irrational?

8lje8a	Advice	Hello,I am just looking for some advice of where I can turn to in order to help some of the insecurity issues I have.At the end of college, in my last semester, I got out of a two a year relationship in which the woman trashed me to my face and our friends. Told me she wasn't happy for 6 months in our relationship and ended it with me and immediately started dating somebody else. I found out after that she had been cheating on my in the final weeks of our relationship. She made me out to be a bad person even though I was financially taking care of her. As you can imagine, this absolutely crushed me and I was very upset and it took me awhile to get over it. That brings me to my last relationship which just ended in a fireball with her hating me. We dated for a about 6 months and then broke up and started hanging out again for about two more months and stuff went south really quick. I would say we were pretty much dating during these two months as we were talking all day, hanging out at night and sleeping over all the time and going to dinner together, going to baseball games etc... What really bothered me about the relationship though was it seemed like she was hiding me away from the world. She didn't want to post pictures of us together on facebook or instagram \- because she wouldn't get as many likes with me in them as she would by herself. She didn't introduce me to her friends, only her family. All this is while guys were messaging her telling her she's beautiful, asking if she's single, wanting to hang out. I said it didn't bother me as long as she didn't hide it from me. I don't mean let me look through her phone, but just say oh this guys only wants this, he isn't a friend or anything. What irked me the most was if somebody was hitting on her she wouldn't turn them down, she would just play games with them and wouldn't let them know that she was in a relationship. I let her know about my past and I mentioned that it bothered me that she didn't want to post photos of me or tell people that she was in a relationship, saying that it was a little disrespectful to me and our relationship that they are making advances on her while she wouldn't say anything to make them stop and she said I was making a big deal about nothing.  Now keep in mind, she has guy friends that she let me know about, who they were, where they lived. And I had no problem if they wanted to hang out. They were in the picture before me, I get it. I let her go on dinner dates with them and wasn't obsessive and keeping tabs on her the whole night. I just said, have fun, I'll see you later tonight :\) Come to the two weeks before the official end of the relationship, I noticed the same two guys are blowing up her phone while we are together and I noticed that she is on the phone while we are hanging out more often than not \- which is highly unusual. One of these guys has straight up texted her, 'I want to fuck you' in the beginning of our relationship. I ask her who they were and she just brushed it off saying that they are just texting her but she doesn't respond. A could of days later, we are at an event, where we need a mobile ticket to scan in, and she pulls up her phone asking for help and she hides her phone from view very obviously, and when asked about it she said 'that guy you don't like texted me again.' My mind is, why is he still texting you if you don't respond and why are you hiding your phone, and why is the conversation history pulled up when we have been hanging out for the past two hours. I question her about it more and she blows it off saying its nothing. The last night I ever saw her I was over at her place and I go to bed early because I was exhausted, but while I was in the other room getting ready for bed I noticed that she is texting somebody and constantly looking at the phone waiting for it to light up. During the middle of the night, I did a huge no \- no, and looked through her phone and she caught me doing so. I admit, looking through phone was a wrong thing to do, I should have ended the relationship right then and there because I didn't trust her. But my mind was going through asking if I am wasting my time, and I need proof before breaking up. Regardless of what was on the phone, it was the same two guys, she gets really pissed and says I have major trust issues and need to get over them and we break up and never talking again.This brings me to the advice portion of this post. I do admit I have a hard time trusting somebody after being cheated on and having my name drug through the mud to my previous friends. Both these girls were people I wanted to end up marrying at the time because I want to be committed and raise a family. Is there anything I could do, resources to look at, or mental exercises I can do, so that going into my next relationship to be more relaxed when it comes to the relationship? I want to be able to trust my girlfriend again with all the trust I had before my college relationship. I don't want to be jealous boyfriend in the future and I want to be able to know that I won't make it a hindrance on myself for the future. Regardless of how I acted was right or wrong, I am just looking for advice to be better for myself and my next future partner.

d1p5q1	Advice	"I really haven't been this depressed in a while. To start with a little context; all my life I've thought of my father as a kind, hard working and honest man that wanted nothing for the best for his family. Unfortunately my perception of him has changed recently though a part of me still believes this. My older brother has always had problems with our dad. Various different things over the years some my brothers fault and some dads. I never really understood. It was only until the last year or so where my brother (26) had really started hating dad even disowning him as a   father which broke dad's heart. I'd always be on dads side as I didn't fully understand why my brother would overreact like that. My brother won't ever speak to him again as he is known to hold a grudge. It's only now I know the reason but I'm getting there. Dad and mum split up 10 years ago and about 6 months after that Mum moved in with a new boyfriend. They were technically still married. One night Dad showed up to their place (boyfriend wasnt home) and proceeded to rape my Mother. I had no idea what happened at the time as I was 9 but my brother was the one who told me this recently. How he found is complicated. I straight up did not believe him at the time and thought he was making stupid and wild accusations out of his hate for dad. I was completely convinced my own father would be incapable of doing something like this as I thought him as the most honorable and loving man. In some respects he still is and has always been a great father to his sons which make this more difficult for me. I live with Mum these days and Dad lives a few hours drive a way. Before this I kept in contact with him. Anyways I asked mum next to hear the truth. I know I shouldn't have brought the memory back up with her but I needed to know. She confirms it did happen as in her words ""he felt it was his given right"" because they were still married. I said it's no ones right to rape anyone. I was so angry. Keep In mind this happened 10 years ago and they still spoke afterwards. She just accepted it and moved on with her life after and I can't fault her for that. I haven't dealt with dad yet and he's been trying to call me as I haven't spoken to him in a while. I'm scared to face him. He doesn't know I know and mum said to just leave it. How can I but? He's a different person In my mind now and I can't speak to him like nothing happened. I know it happened a long time ago but still? I'm quite depressed and I don't know what the right thing to do is. I finally understand my brother now and his resentment but don't know if that's the way I should act.

Her family is tough, and she spends most of her time with me. I am afraid if I leave her she will literally have no one.

A brief backstory is that my brother transferred the title in my name and the car needed to be fixed so I gave the car back to him. Parents gave me a better working car and I didn’t pay for my brother’s car anyway so they told him to keep it. Now it’s a battle of trying to cancel the insurance. I need to know what to do.

auqnv1	Advice	"  This is a true story. Details have been changed to protect all parties involvedA colleague of mine recently submitted a request to work from home once a week. The circumstances are as follows: A few months ago, her one-year old son was diagnosed with a rare, terminal disease. After months in the hospital, her once perfectly healthy baby now has a breathing tube and feeding tube. He has multiple seizures daily or per week and calling 911 or racing to the hospital has become a norm. Home health aides, nurses and hospice care are in and out of their home daily. Her son will most likely not survive to the age of two.She and her husband have been on FMLA (unpaid leave – protects employment) since the first hospital stint… they did work on and off, in the office, from the hospital and from home.  Currently, she has returned to work in the office full-time. She lives 60 miles from the institution. Her department works on laptops. They do not leave their desks – no forward-facing work.The institution’s HR policy states an employee can work from home if *approved by their direct report/management.* In several departments, throughout the institution, working from home is common under special circumstances (Example: When a mother returns from maternity leave, a department manager may approve she can work from home one day a week, to assist with caring for her newborn baby.)The employee submitted a request in October of 2018 to work from home. She received her answer in February of 2019 (after several inquiries regarding the request’s status). She was not denied permission; however, it was clear her management team was not pleased with the request. She was told she can work from home every third Friday. If it snows, and the roads are bad, she must drive in or choose to stay home and take a personal day. (Please note: During inclement weather, nurses and home health aides commonly call-out, as they too have their own families.)Her management team stated, *“If we allow you to consistently work from home, other staff members may expect the same privilege.”*Then, my colleague contacted HR – hoping something else could done. HR’s response, *“If management is consistent with all employees, there is nothing we can do.""*My colleague is heartbroken, stressed, and feels defeated.I am posting this for two reasons:1. Is there any advice someone can offer for my colleague? She can’t quit, as her family needs health insurance (the medical bills are already astronomical) and finding a new job would be difficult under these circumstances.2. Perhaps, I’m bias or just a rational person with empathy or both! … but I need to understand *WHY?* Why did the management team keep the request for over four months, and then, basically deny it? Why would a leadership team show little to no empathy for their employees? What do they gain? And how does HR not see a breach of protocol and policy? Clearly, these are extenuating circumstances - the woman’s child is dying - and yet, working from home once a week is seen as a “privilege” by her management team? It’s revolting, and as an employee of the same institution, I am both horrified and embarrassed by their actions.

However, she recently got a boyfriend and every night for the past 3 weeks he’s slept in our tiny dorm room. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a great guy and I really like them as a couple, but he has his own room. I don’t understand why they can’t spend some nights at his place, or why they even need to spend every night together. It’s really annoying because I can’t even change without having to change in the bathroom. She’s never asked me if he could spend the night. Anyway, I feel I should say something to her.

bxg07w	Advice	"I'm sixteen years old and my English teacher is also the teacher who is responsible for the school rockband which I am the singer of. He is pretty young (28 years old) and handsome so lots of young girls have a crush on him. He is known for that.Now, I have attended various events outside of school together with the band and we have performed in some places. This specific teacher helped us organize all that. I've never had a strange feeling with him even outside of school because I was always with my bandmates.But today, I was watching the school choir practice for a concert and he was in the row behind me for a good 10 minutes before he came up to me and said my name kind of shyly (as a question), which I already thought was a bit strange and not very teacher-like. So then he told me about this cool thing he does with his friend which is play a few songs acoustically in a cafe, get paid for it and also advertise for themselves so that people hire them to play at weddings or birthdays. And he asked me if I was interested so I asked ""with the band?"" and he told me ""no, just you"".I didnt think much of it so I said yes. Then he continued telling me about how we will *obviously* need my parents permission since I'm a minor and that THE THREE OF US (my teacher, his other male friend and me) could practice during the summer and start performing together in August. He mentioned that we could practice at school but if that doesn't work he said we could do it at his house.And because I'm an insecure dumbass, I didn't want to say that it was a bit strange. I kind of wanted to ask ""is this even legal?"".AND THEN He asked me to give him my email which is obviously totally fine. But then he asked for my Instagram and the thing with that is: Every student at our school has found his instagram and followed it (he posts covers) but he has never followed a student back because wouldn't that be weird?? Well. He then said ""this is the first and last time I'll be following a student on social media but oh well,  let's do it"".Am I overreacting? I just feel like he was giving me the flirty eyes but then again, I dont know anything about men or how people flirt so maybe he was just being nice? The problem is that I felt like I was talking to some guy I just met, not like my TEACHER. I just completely forgot that he was my teacher in that moment and that confused me.My sisters and my friend think he's sketchy but I'm not sure and I really wouldn't want him to get in trouble over my stupid misinterpretation. My sister said he was ""grooming me"" and that I should be very very careful not to get a crush on him just because he's young and good-looking. What do I do?"

In my opinion 3 weeks is way too fast but my friends say that I’m just looking for a reason not to do it because I’m scared, yes I’m shit myself a bit when I think about asking her out but that’s normal I guess, but I actually think that 3 weeks is way too soon.

Anyway, in the middle of all this I'm laughing and smiling and what not and I look across the room and there he is. Staring. It was so awkward, he knew I saw him.

cd9tqr	Advice	"I originally posted this on AITA wondering if it would be wrong to flat out cut her from my life, but there were a few replies on other ways to go about our friendship so I figured I would ask you guys for your opinions.I was at my tennis club waiting for my  mate to get there one day so we could practice a bit, when he texted me  and said he couldn't make it. No big deal, there is normally someone  there I can have a hit with or at least sit and watch for a bit. No such  luck, the only person there was a 12 year old girl all by herself. This is weird because we don't have any junior teams but I figured why no  ask her for a hit. We got a talking a bit and I found out that she's  newish to our city and her parents just dropped her off there and left,  and she was just going to walk home whenever she wanted. This struck me  as unusual, but I did similar things at that age so it didn't ring too many alarm bells tbh.Eventually some other guys showed up and I introduced her as the lost child she  was and they joined us for a bit. After a few sets they wanted to go and  practice for real, and I don't have that much stamina so I was looking  to head off. I asked her if she had any friends she could play with  normally and she told she doesn't at school, she was just planning on  coming to the club and seeing who she could find. This is where I  suppose I made a risky judgment call and gave her my phone number and  said to text me if she ever wanted a hit.Fast forward a few months and I would consider us friends. We go out once a  week for a hit of tennis, she tells me about her life and me about mine.  I made some calls to my junior club and managed to get her signed up as  a fill-in for some teams, and even once got her dinner once because her  parents were off god knows where.This is the main point of contention. Her parents don't know I exist and  tbh, I don't know that they exist with 100% certainty, I've never seen them nor spoken to them. They are very much absent a lot of the time  (not abusive though, I've done all the phone calls and whatnot) and I  can tell it weighs heavily on her. This makes me extremely uncomfortable  as I am well aware of the implications of hanging out with a 12 year  old girl as a 19-20 dude. At the same time though, I'm her only friend  at the moment. I've done my best to help her make new friends her own  age and with similar interests, and at some point I feel like for both  of us it's best we part ways.I just want the best for her, she's extremely intelligent and capable and  I do legitimately care for her, and only being friends with a grown ass-dude is not the best thing for her. I just wonder if cutting her off  now would make me an asshole and do more harm than good. I have asked friends and they give me a  mixture of ""what are you waiting for"" and ""how could you even think  about it"". Maybe I should wait until she makes at least one other friend?"

ayanhi	Advice	Hey guys, so me and my fiance have been together for a few years and we're in our 20s. No major problems the whole time.  However, last night she went to some friends' house after work and invited me over, but I ended up working late. I show up 4 hours or so later and it turns out she had just been in another room making out with someone she met briefly a long time ago when we were still together (who she kind of liked at the time). He initiated it and she kissed him back, they made out for 5 minutes or so, and he was touching her over the pants but she didn't touch him at all back.  She deeply regrets it, and immediately told me about it, unprovoked. She had been extremely drunk at the time, but I still feel alcohol doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't already do, it just makes it easier. She never really had a chance in her teens to go crazy and date people, go on crazy adventures, travel, etc. and I understand it's hard getting into a long term / serious relationship so young. She was 100% honest and transparent about every detail, even things I never had any way of finding out.  What is your guys take? It would already be over with, in my opinion, if it had only been a short kiss. She says she never would have done it normally, but that her head was all fuzzy and it was a random and exciting unexpected event and she just went with it. She also said she wants to say she'd never do anything like that in the future, but is not 100% sure because apparently she's capable of it when she drinks like that.

97gkf8	Advice	This is my first post. Tbh i just joined reddit tonight to get some advice on this situation. It happened today.So basically I am in a LDR with an American girl. I am Irish and I have come to visit her for the entire summer. Today while she was out I was cleaning up around the bedroom as i had left alot of shit layin around and i didnt wanna be a slob. So while im pickin up my clothes i find a pair of boxers layin just under her bed. Like... Just peekin out from under, not stuffed away hidden. I just assumed they were girl boxers she wears on her period or some shit. I genuinely thought nothing of it. She got home and we were hangin out watchin tv and i said hey i have all my clothes in the wash basket (she washes my clothes) and i added, oh i found your girl boxers too. She looked confused.. I was like.. Your boxers.. She asked me to show her. I went and got them... And she just laughed and said is this a joke.. Theyre yours.. At this stage i was getting pissed. I calmly told her do not say that again or im gonna flip out. She told me she had never seen them before in her life. I had been staying there for two weeks. We literally had never been apart for more than 5 or six hours and of those times i was at home. So i have no idea how they ended up on the floor. She then said exactly what i was thinking. Which is that they must be her exs who would leave clothes and other items at her house when they were dating (they broke up 3 years ago) and she said she hadnt dated anyone or slept with anyone after that until she met me. But if thats the case.. And they were somewhere in her walkin closet for years how did they end up on the floor under her bed?I didnt even get mad. I just got real quiet. I think she was frightened. In any case. Even if that explanation is true i had my girls ex bfs boxers in my hand today. Just a bad situation. Felt like shit about it.

bxvw90	Advice	"My wife and I have been married for a little over six months. I have had my dog for 9 years (long before even meeting my wife). He's a big collie/australian shepherd dog. I'll admit he is pretty spoiled. He lived inside and got regular treats. However, he is perfectly house trained and never destroyed anything. I am a dog lover and he is like a child to me. Before we got married, my wife agreed that she would let the dog continue living inside even though she didn't like how he shedded.  I am a dog owner who vacuums regularly to ease this problem so it wasn't terrible in the house, but I understood her issue since she had never had an indoor dog before.  She is not allergic though. She agreed he was too old and spoiled to be thrown outside all of a sudden. She actually liked him before we got married.After about a month of being married, she decided she couldn't take the hair in the house anymore. I conceded without much fight and started putting him outside in our fenced in back yard a lot more. After about 3 months, I conceded more and more until he became a complete outdoor dog. He has not set foot (or paw) inside our house in 3 months. I would bring him into the garage during bad thunderstorms (he's terrified of storms), but even that now is prohibited. I built him a doghouse to try to give him some shelter from the rain, but he only sometimes gets in it.  During the spring, my wife wanted to start growing a small garden (mainly herbs and a couple of flowers). The dog apparently didn't like the smell of one particular flower and kept digging it up (he left all of the others completely alone). She got extremely pissed about this and had me buy and install a small garden fence to keep him out. I bought a cheap one and installed it. The problem is that she planted these plants right next to the house which is where he liked to lay down.  So he is constantly jumping the fence to lay down in the mulch up against the house or on the concrete patio. He does not destroy any of the plants anymore. She's just afraid he's going to sit on her plants and ruin them. The more time goes on, the more rules she puts on me about him. It's come to the point where I'm not allowed to pet him anymore. She doesn't want me touching her after touching him (he is a little stinky now staying outside all the time). Washing my hands isn't enough. If I touch him at all, I can't touch her until I take a shower.She resents the dog also because she thinks I love him more than her. She thinks that I can't love both of them; they are mutually exclusive. She is the extreme jealous type. I can spend the entire day with her giving her my full attention and love, but if I just say ""hello"" to my dog, it ruins the entire day. One time, when we had an argument, she told me to leave her alone so I went and took the dog for a walk around the neighborhood. Now, every time she yells at me she tells me to go ""run to my dog because that's what I do"". Now she's making me choose him or her.  She says if a man truly loves his wife, he would get rid of the dog that's causing so many problems.  I would have no problem getting rid of the dog if he posed real problems. But I don't feel he does.  She's not allergic to him. He's not mean. He doesn't growl at or bite her or anybody. He's the sweetest, happiest dog you'll ever meet.  He doesn't even bother her plants. She is making him into a problem. Now she has told me that she wants me to get rid of the dog and if I don't she's implying that she'll divorce me. She is more important to me than the dog, but I don't feel like I should have to get rid of him to prove that. We have other problems too that she threatens divorce over, but she won't even let me try to fix them until the dog is gone. I'm afraid if I do get rid of the dog, the other stuff will still make her divorce me, then I'll be divorced AND not have my dog.  What can I do?"

eb20jv	Advice	TLDR : i’m a picky eater with ARFID and I genuinely want to be able to enjoy food but everything sounds and look disgusting and when I try new stuff (at least one new item a week) I get a physical reaction (throat closes up and gag reflex) I think something is very wrong with me. I have always been a picky eater and was diagnosed with ARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) about 3/4 years ago I think ? But I never got help for it. I’d say I eat about 15 different foods total, but I really struggle with mixing them or new textures. Recently, I have made a genuine effort to eat healthier because I have pretty much every nutrient deficiency on the market and I think that’s why I’m always tired and miserable. I also want to be able to cook more elaborate stuff because I love cooking. The thing is, most stuff just sound or look disgusting to me. I was tryinh to google dinnee recipes for tonight and I am actually hating myself because everything I red just sounds gross. It’s very hard to explain, but I feel like a child and I am very limited in what I eat and I just hate it. I try my best to try new foods like I actually do. I try at least one or two new food item/cooking techniue a week. But when I eat something, it feels like it’s just not meant to be consumed and my throat basically closes up and my gag reflex won’t let it happen.I just want ro know if anyone has any advice or ideas on how I can enjoy food and stop being a baby.

be2eny	Advice	"TL;DR: Friend of almost 20 years is in prison for child pornography and I only just learned why. How can I remain their friend?*Serious answers only, please. I've changed the names, dates and locations on this message and my account is a throwaway.* Back in the very early 2000s I befriended a great guy, whom we'll call Simon. We met online in the (relatively) early days of the internet as we had a lot of in common. In fact, having the same interests was exactly how we got talking and joking on the same forum for particular types of vehicles. The private messages on the forum progressed to emails and then messaging on ICQ, and calls on Skype.We were just about the same age and both enjoyed the same sorts of car modifications and shared our vehicle mods, while making heaps of jokes about each other's lives and states. Just two regular teenage guys mocking each other for fun. As we moved around the country and changed jobs and met women, we kept in touch. I mean, let's be honest, for many guys, real friends aren't easy to come by in this online age and we had so much in common.Recently he confided in me that he was undergoing serious legal trouble and declined to say what it was about. Knowing his character, I assumed it would all be sorted out quickly, although I was concerned. Simon sent me pictures of his home, his wife and daughter. It looked like an idyllic family. I wished him the best, and told him to stay positive.Months progress and I hadn't heard from him, so I emailed him. Days later, his wife responded that he was presently incarcerated in a federal prison and declined to say why. She would prefer that he talked to me in his own words. This shocked me, and I assumed he must have hit someone with his car or perhaps he defrauded someone. I thought the worst, but I knew Simon's character. She asked if I wanted to email him, to which I naturally said, ""Yes, of course.""Prison email is monitored, and Simon was coy about sharing specific details of his situation, and what he did tell me was intentionally vague. I put that down to the monitoring of our conversations and that his case must be complicated. I tried to be supportive and hoped that whatever it is can be sorted out and that you can go home to be with your daughter and wife soon and just get back to work. He was still the same upbeat man, and our emails continued in a friendly, upbeat manner for some months, via the ""Corrlinks"" correctional email service. All that changed about three hours ago and it's been occupying my mind to the point I began to write this, which is becoming much longer than I thought. Anyway, I was explaining to my wife the latest email I sent to Simon this morning, wishing him the best. I wondered about posting him some photos of my new car, seeing as email attachments weren't possible. She asked where the prison was, to which I explained. She began to google it, learning that it's a federal prison. She became curious and googled his name, which has unique spelling. I hadn't googled it, because I got the impression he'd be out soon and things would all be fine. Well, that turns out to not be the case. We found an article from his part of the country, in his local newspaper, showing that Simon was caught with child pornography on his computer - and a substantial amount. More googling and checking the dates, wording of his emails and his wife's email revealed that it is absolutely the same man as the man in that local news site without a shadow of a doubt. He plead guilty in court and is a convicted pedophile.It's been about three hours now and the wind is still out of me. I must have taken heavy, deep sighing breaths two hundred times. I really, truly don't know what to do. Do I give up on a friend who's laughed with me, yelled at my terrible choices with women, and supported me when I needed it? The easy (or lazy) answer is ""Yes!"". And I hear you. In fact, my first response was to cut all contact because he's tarnished and I don't want to be associated with such people. BUT...I want you to try to imagine you were genuinely in my shoes. No, really. Take a moment. Imagine that one of *your* friends - pick one (such as the last person you shared a coffee with, or a beer with on the weekend just gone). Now, imagine THEY did what my friend did. You've been friends for almost two decades to someone who did what my friend did, by all accounts only in the last two years. Change Simon's name for theirs, and imagine *their* partner sending you the same kind of email I received. So, Peter or Kate or Dave or Jeff or *whoever* your friend's name is, did this terrible, terrible thing. Can you throw away their friendship. Especially when they need it the most. If the answer is yes, then it seems I've lost a friend and they did it to themselves. If the answer is no, then *how do I keep a friendship with such a human being?*His prison emails are still full of humor and jokes. It's the same old Simon. But it's not.There's a lot of made-up nonsense on the internet, written by teenagers with nothing better to do, but I don't have time for such nonsense. I'm early 40s and in a real pickle. I truly have no idea what to do and I'll be reading your answers with interest. Please, save the jokes for another day."

She claims he came onto her quick and straight away she pushed him away and was apparently sick. I'm very sceptical because I've heard being drunk doesn't make you do things you usually wouldn't, so why would she put herself into this situation?

So now they hired some older super Christian bitch lady who literally has zero experience working with children to work with me in the afternoons. She refuses to let me train her because, I assume, I am so much younger. She went behind my back and tattled on me to my manager for asking her to help the other teacher that day which made the most sense and my manager would’ve asked her to do any ways.  And this morning instead of coming in the room to ask me what should be done, she went to the other infant teacher and asked her, she’s almost fifty so I’m sure that’s why. It hurts my feelings because I’m good at my job and take it very seriously. And it’s just REALLY pissing me off. I am a zero-conflict type of person. Confronting her would give me a panic attack. I am just eternally pissed and want to strangle her instead. It’s a struggle. I don’t know what to do.  She does a ton more annoying stuff but these instances are what pissed me off the most.

dhv2e4	Advice	We live in Denver, Colorado but are visiting relatives in Austin, Texas. Me, dad, mom and relatives were waiting outside the movie theater doors to enter. A few meters behind us, I noticed a very tall man with a long blond beard and a cowboy hat on. He looked at us a lot, especially my mom, when she made eye contact with him, I saw that she was red in the face and she looked very uncomfortable.The doors opened and everyone entered the movie theater. There were not many people in the hall, we had basically taken a whole series of chairs for ourselves, the man who looked at mom very much sat on the same row, he continued to stare at us. After a while my mother went to the bathroom, not much after that the man got up and he also left the cinema.After the movie, when we were going out, I saw the man again and he stared a lot. Mom, dad and our relatives walked home because their house was close to the movie theater. I stopped and decided to talk to the man. I first greeted him and then asked what he liked about the movie, to be nice and polite. Then I asked him who he was and why he was watching us a lot, but I meant why he was watching my mom. His name is Anderson and he said he knows my mom, I was curious and asked how, he smiled and asked me to ask her instead, I nodded and went home.I came home, everyone was there and had dinner, I waved to my mom and asked her to walk with me a little, she first asked why, because it was unusual for me to walk with her, but I said it was about something important, so we apologized and took a walk. After a while, I asked her who Anderson is and if she knew him, I saw that she reacted strangely and became suddenly stressed. There I realized it was something big. I asked mom again and asked her to be honest, and that I would not get angry.She was nervous, I could see it. She then began to talk about Anderson. He was her boyfriend many years ago, when they were younger and studying in college. I felt something break inside me after hearing this, but I didn't show it so she could tell me everything. Mom said that after graduating from high school in Syria, she decided to study to become a lawyer in a college in the United States, that it was something she had planned since she was in elementary school. She said that she got accepted in the college here in Austin, Texas but that she did not know where to live, they did not offer her a room so she had to arrange one on her own. Mom said it was during the summer of 1990 when she was looking for somewhere to live, because she would start studying in late August. She had a hard time finding so she got desperate, and she met Anderson at McDonald's they were talking and then mom told him her situation and he offered her a room in his apartment, he would also study at the same college here in Austin.Mom was unsure, she wasn't prepared to live with a man, the idea was to live with a girl or alone. But after thinking about it for a few days, she had to accept because it was her only chance. So she lived with him in his apartment. She informed her parents that she had found a house with a girl, she did not say it was a man because her parents would not allow it. After two weeks living together they started dating, mom said she was not used to live like this because our values ​​and culture prohibit such. But after Anderson flirting with her and picking on her, she admitted that she got intimate and started having sex with him and they got together. Mom explained to me that they lived together as a real couple, they hung out every day, went out to restaurants, went to the movies, etc.She said that they were together for seven years, during mom's 4 years in college and 3 years in law school. So Mom said that in 1997 after she had finished studying, she decided to go back to Syria to work there, get married and form a family. She then ended her relationship with Anderson, she broke up and left the United States to return home. Then three years later at age 28th she married my father and gave birth to me a year later in 2001. Then she became quiet and begged me not to tell anyone about her past. I saw tears in mom's eyes and she said that she is very sorry for not telling me her story and told me not to get a bad picture of her, that she's still the same person. I looked at mom and just nodded, I was completely shocked, I never thought that my mother had been with someone before my father, it felt strange. But it was after all a long time ago, but I do have bad thoughts from hearing her story. It feels like I lost respect for mom, no one knows this story, neither her family nor dad, I'm the only one who knows.We came to the US from Syria in 2013 because of the civil war that broke out in 2011, both mom's and dad's families came also with us. We've been living in Denver, Colorado but we are visiting our relatives in Austin, the same city mom used to live in with her ex-boyfriend, Anderson. After our long conversation ended we returned home, no one said anything about what we talked about. I don't now what to do with this information, how I should be reacting and if I should tell dad about it, but if I do that, it would jeopardize mom's and dad's marriage and relationship.&amp;#x200B;How can I forget about her past relationship with Anderson? How can I see their relationship as something positive and educational? How and what should I do to accept what she did before?Other questions I would like to ask about mom is, was it a mistake to have dated and lived with a stranger in another country, which led to a seven year long relationship, where she lost her innocence / virginity, she lied to her loved ones and that her relationship over there went against the values ​​and the norms in our culture.

9804km	Advice	Throw away account for starters.My life is good. Like really good. Own my own very successful business, a great house. Married over a decade to a woman who is gorgeous inside and out. 2 amazing kids. Great pooch. Lots of hobbies. Lots of friends.But I hate myself.It’s brutal. Everyone sees me as this happy go lucky guy. But inside I’m miserable. It all started a year ago. My wife says she wants a change in our marriage. I had literally been working at being a better me for a solid three years. Lost a bunch of weight, gained an exuberant amount of patience and self confidence, just overall everything seemed amazing. But my wife, who I love so much hits me out of the blue with this “I need a change.” Find out a month or so later about this young guy from her work that has caught her eye. My wife is stunning, and I’m not that special to look at. Handsome enough, but nothing to write home about. We go through counselling, and everything seems to just click better than ever. She says she’ll stop contact with this guy (8 years her junior and very good looking) and everything seems to go back to normal. Better than normal, we start falling in love all over again. Truthfully I had never stopped even for a second loving her, but things were two way again. Than the lies start. Soon enough I find out she is still in contact with this guy. Nothing romantic on his end, but her feelings are getting more serious. I don’t know what to do, but I stay cool and I leave it up to her. She quits her job and promises she is cutting that relationship off. I truthfully believe her. She gave me all her passwords, and constantly left her phone in the open which I checked. It was a weird, scary time. Things have gotten better between us. I don’t hold it over head and she constantly reminds me that she sorry and totally committed. But I’m not the same now. Scared, and internally depressed. I had just started to like myself, and now I’m back to a state of self loathing. No one knows and I hide it well because I just want her and our kids to feel loved and appreciated. I want her to feel like I’m over everything because I’m not perfect and I don’t expect her to be either. But inside I’m a mess. I drink myself silly most nights after she falls asleep and just overall feel insignificant and shitty.

I care for both of them since they are close friends but getting baby this early would make their life so much more difficult as they both go to high school. Where I live, the age of consent is 16 so my female friend might get into some deep problems but I'm not quite sure on that. It also is a taboo where I live to get pregnant at such a young age.

I had strong feelings for him and everybody knew but him. One day, he finally kissed me and we cuddled in bed together all night. I was so excited. The next day he comes over and he tells me that he's gay and that he was just confused the prior night. He then starts dating some guy. I was heartbroken, but I accepted him for who he was. This whole time, my other best friend was this girl sarah. After introducing them two, we quickly became a best friend trio that did everything together, it was awesome. Sarah is also my roomate this year and me, her, and Gus make dinner and have wine all the time. Last night, I was coming home from the bars and heard screaming so I burst her door open to see if she was okay, to find her and gus having sex!

I've been here 3 years, I don't hate it but I don't like it either, but that's not really the point. I really want to switch career paths to something in the psychology field. I currently have an associates degree in communications. Unfortunately, I also have $25,000 in student loan debt from a history degree I didn't complete (through no fault of my own, I had a 4.0 throughout my 2 years there taking 24 credits a semester and was on track to graduate in 3 years).I know this is probably a pointless question that I already know the answer to but I'm naively hoping there is just some way that I've overlooked.Is there any possible way to get from my ""career"" path now to where I want to be without making myself destitute in the process or incurring even more student loans? I already know I will likely never pay off the ones I have now so I don't want even more. I am open to anything, certifications, additional associates degrees, taking classes slowly.

btol50	Advice	Hey, so I just talked to my mother about my internship. The due date to turn in a paper is tomorrow, and my mother is arguing against it. You see, I have this monthly pay from social security due to my autism, which is important to note that it hardly even affects me anymore. From joining this internship, supposedly, that number is supposed to drop hard. And knowing how money goes around in this household, she might have to work another job. She says she uses my money to only pay for the mortgage on the house and phone bills and all other things (which is all things I use, just to clarify). But on the other hand, I need those community service hours if I want to get into a college, especially now that I forgot about the options I had during my Senior year. My school year is almost up, and I'll be a Junior next year, which means colleges are going to look at my grades and overall dedication. I've got some big plans in the future, and frankly I don't mind eating cheap stuff as long as I can start stepping towards those plans. And frankly, this is more than just wages or colleges I'm concerned about. The biggest thing I want...&amp;#x200B;Is to have more freedom. My mom would *never* allow me outside without some sort of supervision. She'd let me out with my friends, but that took a metric ton of talking and compromise. Now, outside all on my own, just walking around with nothing but my phone and maybe a bit of cash? She'd go absolutely *apeshit.* And to her credit, I was an absolute bastard child in my younger years (which may be due to all the childhood trauma but that's something for another day), and I think every other week I'd run out of the house just to grab their attention. But I've grown since then. I've grown but I was treated the same since I was nine years old up until around half a year ago when I actually started doing stuff against my mother's wishes. Up until half a year ago, she'd pick my own clothes for me, made me do whatever sort of chores, this and that, and I never spoke up for any of it, because whenever I did, she'd usually shut it down with something like 'I am your mother' or 'It's for your own good!'. Fucking hell, I just turned 16 and she's still pinning me down to pop pimples for no apparent reason than for satisfaction. Before she'd tell me some lies on like how if she doesn't do it, it'll turn out like those 40 year old fossil blackheads you'd see on youtube at 3 AM in the morning even though you're clearly disgusted by it. Or something about how 'beauty hurts' or some shit like that, but now she isn't even hiding it. How long did she lie about that shit now, 3 years? 3 fucking years of begging my mother to stop, and even when I'm sweating and crying she'd keep going for another 10 minutes, pin my head against a light so bright that it'd burn my eyes just so she could get a clear view of my forehead? And then after those three years, I'm left with a partially numb face and an obsession over my own pimples as well. &amp;#x200B;In fact, I couldn't even hang out with my friends after fucking 4 PM just cause my mother wouldn't immediately be there to pick me up because of a nightly job she had. Hell I remember when I actually went with my friends for the first time, when I departed from my tournament. It was cold and windy. The lights were still leftover from Christmas, and the cars were passing by from my school. It was a beautiful night, one filled with calming lights from the posts and falling snowflakes from above. And as I walked, and looked back at my school, and around me, I realized how free I was at that moment. I could just go anywhere at that moment and explore for myself. I realized how much control my mother had in my life, and why this is all happening to me. Because she thinks she knows what's best for me, for myself. She thinks she's entitled to my own being just because she cared for me and made me. I know she loves me, and I know she's doing what she believes is best for me, but I'm pissed. I want to be my own self damn it, she never taught me how to do anything, I had to learn it all my god damn self. When I asked 'why couldn't I pop my own pimples myself', she just shrugs it off and says 'don't grow any pimples'. When I asked her why she kept on going after I said it hurt, and how I actually shed tears, she just started laughing. &amp;#x200B;*Laughing.* She laughed whenever I complained about something, either that or she got defensive and brought up the 'I am your mother' excuse. She laughed when I cried, she laughed when I burned my feet at the beach, tearing out the pieces of grass in pain. Does she really love me? Does she really love me or does she just use me? No, of course she loves me,she started crying one time and hugged me. She takes my birthday seriously, a time to celebrate. In fact, that might be the problem. She cares too much. Or is she caring but just doesn't know how to care?&amp;#x200B;Fuck. Fucking hell. I'm sorry for typing all this out. This was supposed to be a post for advice, but I went on a rant instead. I'll sum it all up.&amp;#x200B;**tl;dr: My mom says I shouldn't take the internship because it'll make my social security income drop. In addition, from what I know, my family is reliant on my social security and if I were to take it up, my mother might have to work two jobs again. But at the same time, I want to be my own person with my own cash that I can spend on my own things.

9ufjm5	Advice	I (21F Trans) ended up at my bf’s (21M) house after a small weekend vacation with him and his parents. His parents and siblings are all cool with me. They met me before I began transitioning. My bf, his brother, and I were all chilling in their room when his great grandma comes in and begins to tell them not to bring that “fucking faggot” into the house ever again or else she’d kick me out herself. All while pretending I wasn’t in the room with them. Now, before we went on vacation, she had been gendering me female and asked me who I was because she didn’t remember me. So before I could answer, my bf’s mother answered for me “Oh, that’s ————“. I still go by the name I used before I transitioned so I’m guessing she put one and one together.Now the house, from what I’ve gathered before, is under her name so she definitely has the right to kick me out under whatever pretense she likes. I understand that. I didn’t really try to reason with her because I ended up crying like a baby. I also guess I also expected my bf to maybe not necessarily stand up for me but intervene with something small.I was facing away from the door and on the ground as she walked in while I was repairing my bfs brother’s computer. All he did was rub his foot on my back while he sat on his chair without even looking at me. I felt so humiliated, I don’t even know how he could even think that was comforting. I finished repairing the computer and left. My bf walked me home but didn’t really offer anything to say other than “I didn’t know I had someone in the family like that.”I wanted to talk to him about it but it didn’t really feel like my place to talk to him about anything that happened, especially with me crying at the time and barely being able to talk. This all happened yesterday, and today he’s acted like nothing happened. While I was hurt that she said that, I guess my bf’s reaction to that upset me the most? I don’t know how to bring it up to him or if I should even bother him with that. I don’t know if I’m just overthinking everything. We’ve been dating for four years now, since we were 17. We’ve known each other for even longer than that. I guess I just expected him to stand up for me given the amount of time we’ve been together. But that’s still his family after all. Any input?

8p2rz6	Advice	I live next door to neighbors who frequently have the police called over to them. I have seen a police van accompanied with civilian dressed police officers outside their house. The neighbors with their friends responded by taunting them openly. I think nearly all of the family occupying next door have a criminal record. Most likely some of them are gang affiliated.  I actually indirectly know of their friends  from a place I use to volunteer at , generally bad people. They have lived years next to us but we have learnt to stay out of their way. They have caused trouble with us but it was over small stuff. However there are times when they act up. This is especially when I get to spend the day at home. And now that I am on holiday this is becoming so so frustrating. The neighbors sit outside their garden all day/night. This means we can hear them and they can somewhat hear the ongoings of our house. My room faces their garden so I can unfortunately hear them and see them if I peak from the window. They often smoke weed (day and night) so the smell comes through. This is illegal in our country and they are not subtle about it and will even smoke while we are in our garden.   I am assuming no one has reported them as this has been going on for ages. I ve asked one of my family members about it and they do not want to report it in fear they retaliate, which is understandable.They do not like us being in our garden and I am guessing will smoke the weed infront of us out of spite. The neighbors also often comment aloud 'What are you looking at' when we are there. They are super paranoid and think we are snooping on them, which isnt the case. They have also started whistling at me whenever I bump into them outside or when they can hear me near the windows. If I leave my window open they whistle. My toilet also faces their garden, when I begin to do my business they whistle because they can hear. Out of frustration I now put the tv on loudly because I know that bothers them. I also use the toilet with the window open , which again bothers them because I heard them yell before 'thats disgusting close your window' .To mention aswell...They behaved similarly last summer too. It affected my health alot due to my anxiety condition, I had to take time off work and spend time else where to recuperate. This time though, I am not afraid (due to less people now living next door) but rather upset.  I have come close to ringing the police many times. Even if I ring anonymously they will know I did it. How do I approach this? ps. When I lived in a different area I had problems with neighbours before but these people have a real bad rep.

We had a tiff this morning because I asked for a lot of discretionally money for a trip I’m taking solo. I don’t know what stuff costs, and I ended up asking where money is going that I don’t manage (when it was semi-vetoed). I earn more, and sometimes feel like throwing caution to the wind. I still thrift for clothes and feel like that should balance out. Still the money doesn’t matter, if I hurt the feelings of the person who matters most.It spiraled out and he was depressed today.

8yb80r	Advice	Over the last 18 months my life has somewhat imploded. Our dog (only 2 years old) had a series of unforeseen medical problems that have resulted in a lot of stress. Currently he’s being kept alive by a load of medication, a state that I don’t agree with but my mother refuses to put him down as to her ‘a life is a life’. But seeing him in the constant lethargic state instead of the energetic puppy I knew is desperately sad to me and it’s something beyond my control.I had a 6 year relationship that ended 5 months ago as I discovered my boyfriend had started another relationship behind my back, and eventually when confronted he chose her over me. To go from a promise of moving in together and an imminent engagement to having the life I thought I would have being ripped away is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. I’m getting better, but the pain does still rear its head.The most stressful thing however, is my father. He is extremely mentally unwell with what consultants believe is paranoid schizophrenia, however he refuses to accept any treatment. He has been kicked out of the home as he has become aggressive and erratic, and that behaviour has become directed at us. We have been placed on a police victim list (meaning we have a dedicated worker as they feel there is a real threat of harm), and my father has taken to stalking myself and other members of the family and sending threats of physical harm to us or himself. This often happens in the middle of the night and the constant looking over my shoulder and worry for him as a human being means that I’ve fallen into a deep state of anxiety. We’re working with the police to hopefully get him arrested and assessed with the ultimate aim for him to be committed in a mental institution for treatment even if it is against his will. There's just a lot of bureaucracy involved so the process is slow.The culmination of these things have spun me into terrible anxiety and near depression. My sleep habits have become poor and I’ve lost a ton of weight due to the stress. I look terrible and often I feel like I’m present in life but not ‘really there’. Unsurprisingly this has bled over into my work life.I go in and perform my duties, I think it peaks and troughs on whether I’m having a good day or a bad day, but I know my performance has been patchy. The main issue though is that my work places emphasis on joining in with ‘office culture’ and being friendly to everyone, apart from a guy my own age who knows about my problems, I’m not particularly friendly with any of them. I’m nice of course, but when they’re laughing and joking with each other I feel like I’m outside looking in as I can’t bring myself to ‘snap out of my funk’ so to speak. It's like I'm watching these happy interactions but my own mind is fogged and I can't think of what to say even if I wanted to join the conversation. I’ve heard in bits and pieces that my boss isn’t too keen on me for this reason, and I can tell that along with some others she doesn’t particularly care for me at all. I will say that the people I am friendlier with seem quite fond of me, but those who I’m disconnected from seem to have little positive feelings towards me. I know this is my own fault for letting my situation get the best of me and I deeply regret that this is the situation and it does make me uncomfortable knowing that people don't particularly like me.My appraisal is coming up in two weeks and at the bottom there is the obligatory box for ‘is there anything else you’d like to discuss’. I’m debating whether to request a brief conversation regarding my personal circumstances to assuage the feelings around it and give them confidence that I’ll make steps to try harder in future. But I know there seems to be a stigma around divulging this type of information at work, so I’m unsure. Is this something that I should bring up do you think, even if it’s just to acknowledge it? I know my boss and others are aware of bits and pieces, but I don’t think they know how deeply it has affected me or how serious it is. Things are finally starting to look up and I’m feeling happier than I’ve been in a long time but I feel stuck in this awkward rut I've created for myself. I’d very much like to be part of the office culture as we are a small team of about 20 people, but I’m wondering if it’s too late to explain and try again. Especially where these situations have been going on for a long time it might be a case of there’s no point in mentioning it as people are too set in their opinions. I’m not in danger of losing my job, but just to increase my happiness at work I’m wondering if it’s a good idea? Would my boss sympathise and understand me a little better? And what could I even say that would remain appropriate for a work environment even if it is a very casual one?

cxi9c6	Advice	"My daughter turned 2 weeks old yesterday. My grandma has been fighting off pneumonia in the hospital for a little longer than that. Earlier yesterday morning I got the call from my uncle that she is being moved to hospice and they're not sure how much longer she has.I feel so devastated. This woman raised me. My own birth giver was an abusive person who allowed me to be molested at a young age. My grandma fought for custody of me and won and raised me as her own. This woman IS my mother in all sense of the word. I stupidly followed my daughter's father to a different state and haven't seen my grandma since before I got pregnant. She was so excited to be a great grandma and now my daughter won't even get the chance to meet her unless it's by a miracleMy own birth giver, her daughter, won't visit her. (This is also the woman who called my daughter a ""mistake"" and an ""overdue abortion""). My uncle (her only son and I guess the only person who can make those decisions) is guilt tripping me and telling me I need to come now because my grandma is wanting me there.I don't even have enough spare change for the bus to get to my two week post partum appointment. My daughter's father is becoming more possessive over the car and his money and his drinking has increased to the point of being almost abusive(please dont tell me I need to leave him. I know I need to and am working on it.) So I know he won't agree with me taking Victoria and going to see my grandma. He thinks it would be a ""waste of time"" to see a dying woman before she passes, even though my daughter's pediatrician said it would be okay to travel with her. He refused to let me use his car or even buy us a bus ticket. He has been so mean and almost cruel about it all. I don't know. I just need to get this out. I'm so sad. I've been crying on and off since my uncle called me. I don't want my grandma to die. I thought she had way more time than this. I wanted her to meet my daughter and I want to say goodbye to the woman who I consider my own mom. I just feel so awful about it all. I don't know what to do.

9tqn23	Advice	Less than a year ago I landed a great job with the court. I was over the moon when I got hired! It’s great experience, and I love what I do and I am very grateful for the opportunity to do what I love so much. Eight months into my employment a position opened up at the probate court in my town. I jumped on it. Five minute drive to work, more hours, and more opportunities for advancement. I was hired in on the spot and there was another new clerk who was being hired on as well so we were going to figure out how to divide the work when we all got settled. Fast forward four months. I have no idea what I’m supposed to be doing despite repeated attempts to ask what my role will be. I turns out the other new clerk that was hired not only has a matter in our court for her disabled daughter, but she has personal friendships with the other clerks. She is assigned jobs because she can use her unique personal experience and I get all the crap work that nobody wants to do. I am constantly criticized for the smallest mistake but when the other new girl screws up they fix it for her. If they see me on my phone they complain that it’s a distraction and I need to put it away but the other new girl has her ringer on full blast and takes personal calls at her desk. When I ask why it’s okay for her I am told it’s because her daughter is disabled so it’s okay. I feel like a third wheel at work. I honestly don’t know why they offered me the job if they didn’t know what they wanted me to do. And I’m angry that I am not being treated with the respect and professionalism that I treat everyone else with. I’m starting to get depressed. I am always stressed. And sometimes I just get up and go cry in the bathroom at work because I am just so miserable.

After thinking up several scenarios, I did a comparison of distant cousins who actually share DNA with both of us, and it looks like this person HAS to be my uncle’s kid. My senior citizen bachelor uncle with no kids. He has lamented over not having children, so I genuinely believe he has no idea this adult child exists.

However, last night she went to some friends' house after work and invited me over, but I ended up working late. I show up 4 hours or so later and it turns out she had just been in another room making out with someone she met briefly a long time ago when we were still together (who she kind of liked at the time). He initiated it and she kissed him back, they made out for 5 minutes or so, and he was touching her over the pants but she didn't touch him at all back.  She deeply regrets it, and immediately told me about it, unprovoked. She had been extremely drunk at the time, but I still feel alcohol doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't already do, it just makes it easier. She never really had a chance in her teens to go crazy and date people, go on crazy adventures, travel, etc. and I understand it's hard getting into a long term / serious relationship so young. She was 100% honest and transparent about every detail, even things I never had any way of finding out.  What is your guys take? It would already be over with, in my opinion, if it had only been a short kiss. She says she never would have done it normally, but that her head was all fuzzy and it was a random and exciting unexpected event and she just went with it.

bgq5r9	AmItheAsshole	My daughter Ann (17)  has been obsessed with building miniatures ever since she saw Hereditary a few months back. Since then, she has probably spent close to 500 dollars on miniature sets from Amazon, Hobby Lobby, and etsy. All of this money comes from her job at a local movie theatre, so I can't exactly cut her off. I can't explain why, but something about it drives me up the \*\*\*\*ing wall.  Maybe it's because Toni Collette was so creepy? Maybe I just want to spend some quality time with my daughter instead of  watching her waste her life in her bedroom. I hear my sister talk about dropping her daughter off at soccer, or how her son's the lead in the school play, and then think about how my daughter's upstairs building a tiny cottage with tweezers. She hasn't ever really shown interest in any hobbies before, so I thought it would be grateful that she's finally good at something, but mostly I'm just annoyed. Her grades are fine (Bs), her chores are always done, but mostly every second of her spare time is spent putting together miniatures. I try to ask her if she'd like to go for a walk with me, or sign up for cheerleading, but she always says no. My husband thinks its sweet and has started letting her put them around the house and in his office at work.

b7nyiy	AmItheAsshole	"My now husband and I got married 1.5 months ago. We had 6 people on each side of the bridal party. This wedding took 3 full years to plan and prepare for. When I got engaged, most of the bridesmaids were very single, including Anna, the ""star"" of this story. Two of them were in long term relationships. I wanted to just give the two partnered bridesmaids plus ones. Anna seemed offended by this, because my wedding was then years off, and she was actually dating her now husband at the time (though it was casual).I eventually got pushed by my mother to give all of them plus ones. Anna actually continued to date that guy, and married him four months before my wedding at two months pregnant. She brought her new husband as her plus one (who I never met prior) and convinced one of the other bridesmaids to take her friend as hers (when she KNEW we didn't like him). She was hugely pregnant, and didn't refrain from showing it off. We're both fairly young (25) and in my husband's culture, getting pregnant before late 20s/30s, married or not, is basically a teenage pregnancy and drew ATTENTION. She also has a vibrant personality and has a way of eclipsing everyone around her. Her husband is also very tall and incredibly attractive, which drew a lot of attention.All anyone spoke about or of was Anna's pregnancy and her attractive husband.

aryrpz	AmItheAsshole	"My fiance and I are getting married next year and are planning the wedding. She was choosing her bridesmaids and included her brother. I don't have a problem with her brother, I just think it's weird to have a guy in the bride's party. I pointed out that he wouldn't be able to walk in with a girl, he'd have to come in with one of my groomsmen and she got defensive and said ""so what?"" I offered a compromise of including him in the wedding as an usher or having him walk her down the aisle (her parents have chosen not to attend) and she said no, she only wants him in the bridal party and she doesn't want anyone walking her down the aisle. It escalated into a huge fight because she refused to compromise for our wedding. She ended up going to stay with a friend to calm down and we're meeting later to talk about it.

e5zj3l	AmItheAsshole	We give our daughter $2,000/mo as part of a trust stipend and have been since she was 18. She's 21 now and in school (the trust was originally for school related expenses, incl. rent, food, etc). It's meant to make her school life as stress free as we can afford: she doesn't need to work but still can if she wants for extra money. She chooses not to work and instead live off this stipend.The first year went alright. She picked out a room in a complex for $350/mo and budgeted pretty well for someone who just began living on her own. The second year did not, however. She was evicted within the first five months of her 10 month lease and had to drop out of school that year to move back home. She simply didn't budget things well and went into arrears two months back-to-back. We weren't informed of this and only learned of it in the middle of the eviction process.We don't have access to her bank accounts, she's independent, so we don't know how that situation occurred. We tried again this year and now it's December and she's having money issues again. She said she might have to leave school before the second semester begins due to money issues.She's home for the holidays now so we sat down and had an open conversation. We learned she's spending $1,000/mo eating out every day and close to $700/mo on videogames. No wonder she's in trouble because her rent now is $400 and her phone bill $70.My husband and I want to put rules on this money now. We want to take that $2,000 and have direct payment from our bank to her landlord for her rent, from our bank to her phone bill, then dispense $200/wk. The remainder she can request on a case by case basis. Want to eat out? Phone us and we'll order Skip Dishes for you. Any extra per month we'll give her up front. It's confusing to type out but she doesn't lose money, it's just staggered and mandatory payments we handle on her behalf.I don't want to be /r/insaneparents and I think it's reasonable.

d4x0zs	AmItheAsshole	My wife and I divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since I was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy I barely know. She told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that I'm being petty over something that happened years ago. I told her I wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't be there to see it. I was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so I wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.

She lives in a different state, so most communication has been phone, text, and email. However, she traveled to our state this week, unannounced, and wanted to spend time with M, which I was fine with, but I was not okay with A’s plan to pull M out of school for a day. I told both A and M that I was not okay with M skipping a day of school, but yesterday, behind my back, A signed M out of school and the two spent the day together. When they finally got home, I kind of blew up. I grounded M and told A to stay away. But now, A is leaving on Sunday and said that she wants to spend Saturday with M. I said no, as M is grounded for skipping school yesterday. A called me an ass hole, and M said that she hates me, which is the teenage version of calling me an ass hole.

d27ww9	AmItheAsshole	Let me just start off and say I think cheating is deplorable.I have two brothers, John (28) and Matt (25).Around three years ago, our family exploded when it came out that Matt was having an affair with John's fiance. A fiance who was 6 months pregnant. Matt turned out to be the father.John was understandably humiliated and angry. I was fully on his side.  I was disgusted with Matt and the fiance.Here's my issue though. At John's insistence, Matt has pretty much been excommunicated from our family. He isn't allowed at any gatherings where John is. And John purposely makes sure he is at every one. Matt married John's ex-fiance and are raising the 2.5 year old together.To this day, Matt's wife is referred to as a whore and the baby is called a bastard. Only by John but in our family's presence. He hates them with a passion even today.My parents have really struggled with this but have agreed to follow John's rule of no contact with the wife or baby. Even contact with Matt is done in secret.Matt has been kicked out of our family business because John can't be in the same room as him. All photos of Matt have been hidden in the family home. No gifts have been given to Matt's child at all.Am I absolutely crazy to think that three years of this is enough? Matt is clearly remorseful and has apologized many times in tears. He clearly regrets hurting our brother.I can understand that John is absolutely hurt and it must've been the most painful betrayal.But I still love both my brothers. Matt did a shitty thing but how much more does he need to be punished?My poor parents have been broken hearted for the past three years because of this. They have confided in me that they are willing to forgive Matt and move on and regret letting it get this far. We were such a tight knit family before.But I'm really worried that suggesting forgiveness with John will cause a massive fight and he'll make us choose between them. I also worry about his mental health.There also the innocent child in this. He deserves a relationship with his grandparents and his aunt.I have recently been visiting Matt and his family. They are clearly struggling with the isolation. His wife broke down and apologized as I held my nephew for the first time. My heart tore in two.AITA for wanting to bring them into our family again and forgiving them? There is family reunion coming up in a week and I want them to attend.

bl7d35	AmItheAsshole	I always knew my daughter really liked to draw but she always liked to draw mythical creatures like dragons. I never expected anything vulgar from her until today when she was rushing out the door for school I noticed she dropped her sketchbook so I went to bring it to her and to my surprise- there was multiple pages of nude drawings of men AND a women. I was appalled. Don’t get me wrong I understand the concept of this for artists and that it’s normal for artists but my daughter is only 14. She has absolutely no business with these types of drawings. She was out the door before I could say anything. Obviously they cannot allow nude models in school so the only other explanation is that she has been viewing the images on 18+ websites. I did what I had to and went on her laptop (which her father and I paid for, btw) to see the history and as suspected a website full of adult nude models and even google searches for specific poses. I waited until my daughter got home and confronted her, i tried to be calm as I could and explained that she has no business viewing 18+ images and those models can get in big trouble if the police find out and underaged girl is viewing them. I told her I would then be confiscating her sketchbook and laptop until she agrees to draw something more age appropriate. i think that this is fair as she can have her stuff back immediately once she agrees, but she is mad and refusing to give in. If she need to practice drawing humans she can draw them from her head not from an adult websites. AITA?

For me, I prefer to pop an edible or two and relax in front of a paint canvas, my sewing machine, etc.My sister's husband had an emergency that resulted in her needing to quickly find a sitter for her 9 year old. I like my niece and obviously wanted to help out my sister, but warned her that she'd probably be bored at my place, since we don't have a lot of kid-friendly stuff.  At one point after she dropped her off with some books, I got up to take a shower. I'm pretty sure this is when it happened.About an hour or so later, I notice niece hadn't said anything for a while. I went over to the couch to see what was up, and she's just staring at the ceiling with one of her books on her stomach. I ask her if she's okay, and I immediately knew something was up. She said ""I ate some of your candy and it made me feel funny.""She had, in fact, eaten several of the sour gummies I had on my dresser. That I hadn't thought to lock up or anything like that because I'm a 35 year old woman who doesn't need to think about those things.

efxoot	AmItheAsshole	Hi all. I browse here a lot but have yet to post. I made a throwaway for this specifically. So on Christmas Eve, I had the day off from work so I decided to do some shopping for myself for a nice outfit for Christmas dinner. I live in a pretty small town so there’s really only one place to shop. I go there pretty frequently so all the employees know me. I found some clothes I liked and went up to check out. I didn’t recognize the girl up there. She looked young, probably a teenager and was visibly pregnant. We made small talk about the holidays and she was very nice throughout the transaction, except for one thing: she was chomping on gum the whole time she was speaking to me and ringing up my purchases. Not just like a gentle chew or anything, but smacking loudly. Now I’m not especially bothered by the gum smacking but I think it would be borderline offensive for older women. So after I paid I pulled the manager aside and said, very nicely, that I knew the girl was new, and that she was chomping on her gum loudly and that it may bother some people, even if it didn’t bother me. The manager didn’t seem so surprised so maybe this is an everyday occurrence or something. She did say that she had been working there for almost five months but I didn’t recognize her so I thought she was new. I was hesitant to bring it up because last time I was there I complained to the same manager too. When I came in I wasn’t greeted or spoken to for about fifteen minutes of me being in the store. I realize they were busy, but there were two girls working and surely one of them could have paused on the registers and come to ask if I needed help. I called the next day and brought it up and got an apology. But I feel that the gum issue was justified because someone would come along and bring it up who isn’t as nice as me. My husband said that it wasn’t a big deal and she may have gotten in trouble but I really doubt it. I just wanted to prevent a bigger issue for the girl in the future. So AITA?

cthhb7	AmItheAsshole	When my son was born, he had a dark skin complexion. Wife and I are both quite pale in complexion. Now originally I thought, this is common in babies at birth and maybe as he got older maybe something to do with the pigmentation (right term?) would change and his skin colour would look more like ours. That never happened.Now for some context I feel is necessary, early on in our marriage there were some trust and fidelity issues when I caught her pretty much on the brink of an emotional affair with her co worker. We stayed together and reconciled, it wasn't easy but I was glad we did and she was very remorseful about how far she had let things go. The problem is, the other guy had the same complexion that my son does. Now this realisation has got me very paranoid.

eerl33	AmItheAsshole	So I (21F) am in my junior year of college. I’ve been extremely careful on not getting pregnant and have tried all avanues. My IUD moved and I almost died so I had to get it removed, the implant in my arm left a rash and started to burn so I had it removed, so me and my FWB started using the calendar and condom method which is basically when I’m not ovulating we would use the pull out method and when I was we would use a condom and a Plan B just for backup.Well, I’m pregnant. I found out in the beginning of December that I am four weeks along. I knew immediately I didn’t want to keep the baby. I considered going through with an abortion via the pill. I got them but couldn’t do it. I know that it was selfish, but until you’re in those shoes you never know how it truly feels.So I decided adoption. I told my friend that I was planning on delivering the baby and she told me about her brother and her sister in law back in her home state that have been struggling with infertility and have been desperately trying to conceive a baby for years without fail. We FaceTimed a few times and I think they would be perfect parents for my baby. They’re both well educated with well paying jobs and an amazing home they could raise a baby in. It actually made me excited to be able to know that the baby will go to a family that so desperately wants them. I decided they would be a great fit and since they’re so far away, it’s like it never happened kinda thing.I finally brought it up to my mom yesterday that I’m pregnant and everything else. My moms first words were “What about Sylvia? Her and Jon would love a baby”. My older stepsister is 28 and infertile. She’s known this for years and we aren’t that close so I didn’t know if she ever planned on having a baby through other means.I said no. Sylvia lives in the same city as me and I see her during holidays and any other family gatherings. I don’t want to adopt the baby into my own family circle and still have to be in some form of its life. I would basically become the step aunt? I just prefer the idea of having a closed adoption in a far away state with a picture every once in a while. My mom started gushing and called Sylvia immediately despite my protests who seemed really happy. She told my mom they were looking into an egg donor and a surrogate but this baby is so much less expensive and less of a hassle.I told Sylvia that I don’t want to give the baby to her for the reasons I listed above and kind of already “promised” another couple that they could adopt the baby. Now I haven’t went through any legal channels via the other couple so it’s not like I HAVE to do it, but I really want to. Sylvia got upset and asked why I would choose a random couple that I know nothing about versus my own “flesh and blood” (Our parents have only been married for 3 years and we never lived under the same roof as she was 25 then). She and my mom both called me assholes.

We have been lucky and are now pregnant, due in late June. My wife is telling me that she does not think we should go. The baby will only be a month or two old, and she is worried about how she will feel after giving birth. The flight would be from the Northeast US, probably a changeover in California, and then out to Hawaii.My feeling is that people travel with 1-2 month old kids all the time. Also we will have a TON of family around us if we go on the trip who WANT to help watch the kid (so maybe we can relax more than if we stayed home), and I don't feel like she is going to still be hurting a month or two after giving birth. Mostly a guess, but my internet researching backs up the theory, so it's not completely out of the realm of possibility.**I am supporting her feelings and haven't said anything negative yet (just how I am pretty bummed about missing it)**, but it is really making me frustrated the more I dwell on it.

caiqdh	AmItheAsshole	My wife has a younger brother (29) who has been in a relationship with his high school sweetheart (who's also a 29 year old male) for about 12 years. I think of both of them as my family, they're my children's uncles, we spend a bunch of time together and we get along great. I recently had a vasectomy, I'm 44, we have 3 kids and we aren't planning on having any more. After one Sunday lunch with our BILs, we sent the kids away and us adults had some drinks and started talking about my vasectomy. At one point, I said how great it was to finally not have to worry about protection, and how great it felt without it. And I said I almost feel sorry for them not experiencing it. My BIL laughed and said: What are you talking about, we haven't used protection since high school.I was going to reply something, but the kids came running in so I dropped the topic. I later thought about what he said and talked to my wife about it, saying that I don't think it's safe for them to be having sex without condoms, as a couple of gay men, and my wife laughed at me. Apparently, just because they've been together for a long time, it's safe? She told me to drop it and let them live their lives however they want.I thought it was ridiculous of her to have that reaction to her own brother not using protection and realized she wasn't going to tell them anything about it. So I figured I would buy some condoms and give them to my BILs and tell them I was worried about their safety and that they should really rethink not using protection.A couple of days ago, we had another lunch together, we sent the kids away again, and I gave them the condoms. I rehearsed a whole speech about how I wouldn't want anything to happen to them and that they should stay safe. But, rather than seeing my gesture for what it was - a gesture of care - they were offended. They asked if I am suggesting they shouldn't trust each other? They said they had never slept with anyone else their whole lives and if they managed to have an exciting enough sex life not to cheat on each other for 12 years, they'll probably manage the same in the future. And my wife's brother also said that, by the same token, I should be continuing to wear condoms despite having had a vasectomy. After shouting at me for 10 minutes, they just left. My wife has been incredibly mad with me and demanded I apologize to them, but I refuse to apologize for caring about their health and safety. I don't see how what I did was THIS horrible. They could have just declined the condoms. And their arguments are ridiculous. So what if they've been together for 12 years? People have cheated on each other after being together for longer than that.

ec28zx	AmItheAsshole	"So, Situation first, then pre-story.&amp;#x200B;I am going to visit my parents over the Christmas holidays for about 2 weeks. During that time my one room flat is empty. As my BF is currently living in a shared flat he likes to stay at my place, as it's quiet, the shower is nicer in his opinion and my PC runs better atm. I have no trouble letting him stay here, have done before. He will also come visit my family for a few days so he won't be here the full two weeks I guess.Now he asked me today (""Maybe I'll just stay at your place"") if he could stay and I promptly and probably in a somewhat concerned voice said: ""yes, however I would like some thing to be taken care of then"". To this he immediately reacted badly ""... then I'll just stay here"". I told him that by this I meant things like opening the windows twice a day so air can come in and maybe water my plants.He stayed frustrated and then said he thinks it's childish talking about ventilating and commented again with ""I thought you might like me staying there just like last time"". After that I explained yes, I would like it, but I would also like to return to my flat in the state that I left it, not with bad air and potentially less tidy. He asked to end the conversation on that note.&amp;#x200B;Some additional backstory: My flat is like most central-european flats not internally ventilated and we don't have A/Cs. Additionally it's one of those flats where the walls are old and the windows are new, so you have to ventilate it well or the walls and floor (wood) will collect humidity. I signed an extra sheet in my renting-contract that I will open the windows wide at least 3 times a day.I brought this up right as he asked, because the last time I let him stay here (that time I asked him and it was for 5 days) I came home to him being there, asked if he had ever opened the windows (I could smell the air being super stale) to which he openly said: ""No, not once"".&amp;#x200B;Right now it's probably unlikely that he will stay here and I don't have a problem with that. I feel like I have the right to enforce certain ground rules in my flat, especially if I let him stay here because he likes it better than his own room in the shared flat. However he is angry and will probably stay away simply out of frustration rather than it actually being a problem for him to open the windows. (He has not expressed problems with the ventilation, as he often agrees vigorously when I ask to open the windows while he's around). He is currently being distan to me altogether because of this.&amp;#x200B;Am I the asshole?EDIT: A word"	EXPERT	If he can't do a couple easy tasks for staying at your place is he even worth your time anyways?	<EXPERT_PCT_1_AUTHOR>	Info: How did you react the last time?	<EXPERT_PCT_0_AUTHOR>	real
c8bw67	AmItheAsshole	"I work in an office building with a rather well-paying job that took several years of education to get (pay is in the low 6-figures). It's a great job that makes me feel like I'm doing more than just paperwork. Bottom-line is, I really love this job and probably won't be able to find anything else like it.I'm eating lunch with some co-workers, and this girl from a neighboring department joins us. After a while, when other people are breaking up into their own little conversation bubbles, she turns to me and says she likes how I look. I say 'Thanks' and then go back to eating. She touches my shoulder and says ""You alright?"" I nod 'Yeah' and go back to eating and listening to other people talk.On another day, she says, 'Wow you keep in shape. You must work out' (which I do). I say 'Thanks' and go back to lunch. She gets closer and says, 'So how do you do it?' I just keep giving short, direct answers. Point is, I don't have any interest in dating co-workers. There's a saying **Don't shit where you eat**. I've heard of people getting fired when workplace relationships turn sour and things get awkward or hostile. I love this job, and I don't wanna do anything to compromise it.Third time this happens (on another day), she asks me when I get off work (schedule is publicly posted so she could find out if she really wanted to). I say 'Probably when I feel like shooting myself'. That was a baaaaaad joke but she laughed anyways and said I was funny. Then she put her hand on my knee. I gave out this awkward laugh and shifted away. She asked me if everything was alright and I looked at her and said 'Maybe you shouldn't do that again' We just stared at each other for a while before she got up and left.Later I heard she was telling people I couldn't take a compliment and that I made her feel 'uncomfortable'. Some of my co-workers didn't believe it, mostly because they were there, but the others weren't so they just believed what they heard first. I went to her to talk about it but she said I made it clear that I didn't want anything to do with her and to leave her alone otherwise I was 'harassing' her.The moment she said that word, that set off red alarms in my head, and I headed to HR. I gave them my side of the story, and I heard later on that they interviewed co-workers that I said was there at each incident. Afterwards, they said the investigation was closed and that no further action will be taken but they will keep a record of this for future incidents.When the girl heard about this, she was *pissed*. She said I was trying to destroy her career, that I was taking advantage of her (she never explained how), and how hard she worked to get here. She started breaking down and crying, everyone was looking at me. I just sat there, eyes wide, until she and another co-worker left the room together.

ealt06	AmItheAsshole	I recently took some of my older daughter’s (we’ll call her M) old toys out from storage to let my younger daughter (we’ll call her V) play with them. V was pretty excited to have some new toys to play with, and it’s been so long since M has even looked at any of it, so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. But then M came home from school and saw V playing with one particular toy, and she told me that she didn’t want V playing with it because it was special because her mom gave it to her. I had honestly forgotten that her mom had given her this toy, as she was out of the picture for most of M’s life, and I did not realize how special it was to her, but I obviously understood that M didn’t want V ruining it so I got it back and told M to put it in her room. And that’s when M started to get angrier about the situation, saying that I should never have touched her stuff without asking her, and instead of taking the one toy to her room, she packed up the entire box (including some of V’s new toys; M wasn’t even sure what was in the original box) and brought it all up to her room. V cried at first when the toys were gone but quickly got distracted by some of her other toys. I went to check on M, and she just left the box of toys sit in the corner of the room, and she told me not to touch it. I understand that the toys might be sentimental to M, but I thought it would be nice to let V play with them instead of letting them all gather dust. AITA?

ebx8yu	AmItheAsshole	"This is the first time I've been able to articulate this to anyone. It goes back pretty far. So I live in PA. I've been very close friends with this guy, let's call him Gary, for about 7 years now. People tend to compare us to Mac and Dennis from it's Always Sunny. Anyway, after college we decided it was time to move about 40 minutes away to be closer to his band. He kept saying ""we have to. It's my dream."" At that time I didn't have much of a dream. I just wanted to stay near my buddy. There, we lived in an awful crackshack-esque building for a year. Ultimately, however, we ended up living in a townhouse for an additional 2 years. It wasn't all bad, but I've made many sacrafices including getting robbed at the crackshack, bed bugs, and the way his band treated me. The lead singer just hated my guts from day one. We were just opposites. He labled me a bitch, and nothing could change that. Agrobro. So the band breaks up, and Gary is left with 1 friend, me. It's obvious to him that I feel we've wasted our youth with the band. He kept giving me possitive reaffirmations. ""Now it's your turn."" ""Now we'll do what you wanna do. Whats your dream?"" Stuff like that. After all, he held the reigns for 3 years. It made sense I'd choose our next step. So I told him I've always wanted to live in CO. He thought it was a great idea, so we drove the 20 hours. Transplanting was harder than we thought, so we ended up spending a month looking affordable housing, then returned home. (Housing is most expensive during skii season.) So we basically scouted it out for our return. Now I'm not being biased or exaggerating, he showed no indication of doubt. None whatsoever. He was 100% confident that in a few months (when it's warmer) we'll return with a better strategy. 4 days ago he told me that he think he's decided he's not doing back. He couldn't give me a straight reason. He was being cliche and saying things like, ""i just won't be happy"" and ""I already did Colorado."" He knows how hard things were for me while I was supporting his music career. Its very hurtful. I feel like if I continue to be his friend, these things will continue to happen because it's his nature to just fend for himself.

bg0cw3	AmItheAsshole	Just as a preface I work as a cashier for a pretty big grocery store, the job sucks most days because some managers are incompetent and like to either micro manage or do absolutely nothing. The job pays less than minimum wage because we have less than 25 employees but everyone still gets about 27 hours a week because people with seniority get the hours (which is fine). This September will be my second year working there.Now there is a system in place to request days off. Basically you just have to do it at least 2 weeks before the schedule is set but you can do it as far back as 5 months. I had a trip coming up in July that was very important to me. So last November I told every manager I could including the director at the time that I would like to request those days in July off as my vacation I get every year. All of them said it was fine. So I reminded them in December and January that I wanted them again. In February as soon as I could I requested my vacation week in July and reminded them again. I have reminded them at least once a month since. We even got a new director and he said it was fine. Now last week I was talking to a coworker and brought up that I requested these day and he say oh really I was actually planning some thing that week too, I asked him if he requested the days and he said no not yet I'll just wait till the end but they'll give them to me because I have seniority, he then told me that another co worker was going to request that week as well and that she also had seniority. Both these people only have maybe 1 to 3 years on me but seniority is taken very seriously at this job. I later asked the co manager( who makes the schedule) If I could still get those days off and she said she didn't know she would have to see because other people requested it that day. Usually taling a week off isn't a big deal but the problem is that 3 people want to so they may only let 1 maybe 2 go. So I thought if I don't get these vacation days then that's it I'm perfectly ok with losing this job. I drive for uber, postmates, Lyft, doordash, and uber eats, on my time off so I could do that until I find another job or just continue going to school.  So my question is, WIBTA if I just don't show up to work if they schedule me on the days I requested?

ce3499	AmItheAsshole	"Okay, hear me out.  I saw a similar story to mine on this subreddit and I decided to make a throwaway to talk about it.  Last summer we finished building a treehouse in our back yard for my 10 year old son to play it. One day he went up there with his friend and ran to me telling me ""our neighbor doesn't have any clothes on"".  Apparently our neighbor, whose family is friends with my family, was sunbathing without a top. I used to be close friends with her husband, but we've definitely drifted apart after this whole situation.   Anyway, this happened a few more times so I told my kid to stay out of the treehouse until I could talk to her.   I texted her husband (my friend) asking if they could text me before she bathes topless in her backyard so I could make sure my kid was inside or at least out of the treehouse.   Within an hour, she came storming to my house knocking on the front door. As soon as I opened it she was screaming at me to mind my business and to tell my ""perv kid"" to keep his eyes out of their yard.   In my opinion, she completely overreacted. I didn't push it further than this though. I just boarded up the window on the treehouse that faces her yard. It was a different story for my wife on the other hand. They ended up getting into a huge argument and are no longer friends. Eventually her husband started to ignore me as well and we haven't golfed or done anything together to this day.

b7ekye	AmItheAsshole	"Am I (23F) the asshole for telling my husband (27M) that if he could maintain his haircut, he ""would get laid a lot more""? He used to take very good care of himself and he was very attractive when we first met. As we've been married, had kids, and life has happened, he's stopped putting effort into himself. He has depression and bipolar, so he tends to not take care of his appearance very well or put any effort into how he looks. He will go months without a haircut or a shave. I've tried to coax him toward styling his hair or trimming his beard into different styles to help him feel better about himself and to help me feel more attracted to him. He always complains we don't have sex enough (maybe twice a week). It's not for lack of trying on my part. He vents his stress and anger at me rather than finding a good coping mechanism by being cranky and snapping at me over little things. It's miserable to come home to after working all day to support him and our two kids. I've told him this many times and he says he's working on it in therapy and to be patient. I am patient, I haven't left or given him an ultimatum, but it really makes sex with him unappealing to me. I try to be affectionate to help, but he is always ""busy"" with something. I've given up. Yesterday, though, he got his ears pierced, trimmed up his beard into a nice goatee, and today he got a nice haircut. I was attracted to him so much I couldn't stop staring at him at the grocery store. I told him when we got home if he could maintain the way he looked right now, that he ""would get laid a whole lot more"" than he does now. He got mad and said I shouldn't be having sex with him based on how he looks.

I have a boyfriend of about a year and a half. He comes over/sleeps over about three days a week. He’s a shift worker so he gets off around 2 pm and sometimes I am not home at that time. So occasionally I’ll give him my key the day before. One of these days my roommate was home and was alarmed he had a key. I explained the situation to her and she said that if he was going to stay over a lot, she was uncomfortable and that he would need to pitch in for rent. I felt like both of these requests were slightly ridiculous. When we moved in together, I told her my boyfriend comes over often (although she claims I said two days a week). Additionally, he’s in my room 99% of the time. It’s not like he’s hanging out in the living room or taking her food or anything crazy. However, I am not a confrontational person and, in the moment, I agreed he would only comeover two days a week. I want to value her being comfortable and maintain that relationship. That being said, I pay just as much rent as she does and do just as much upkeep around the apartment as she does.

I'm 27 years old and she's 25, and the incident I'll talk about happened on our third date.On Saturday night we went to a gourmet burgers and fries place (think Pulp Fiction John Travolta/Uma Thurman car in the wall joint) for my birthday dinner. It was her choice and I thought it sounded like a grand idea, as corny restaurants are always a blast. A while after our burgers came the waitress paid us the typical ""how is everything"" visit, and stuck around for a short chat after. During the course of our talk I ended up mentioning that it was my birthday, and she told me that it was hers too. It was a nice little coincidence and we all seemed to get a kick out of it.Eventually our waitress excused herself. After we finished eating we ordered a couple of shakes, at which point the waitress and I nicknamed each other ""birthday girl"" and ""birthday boy,"" respectively.Our check came, and to my surprise my date didn't make any indication that she was going to pay. I didn't raise a stink about it of course, and I didn't think it was exactly a huge deal. I thought it was normally for the non-birthday party to pay on someone else's birthday, but again, different people may be used to different things.I checked the bill and saw ""Happy Birthday!"" written at the bottom with a cute smiley face. I put in the cost of the meal with a standard tip, and we got up and put on our coats. At the last second I told my date to hold on a bit, opened the bill back up, and slipped in another $100. I wrote with the provided pen ""You too!"" next to her message. My date noticed this and gave me a sideways look.In the car I asked what she wanted to do next, and she gave me the silent treatment, just kind of sighing and looking out the window. I figured it had something to do with the tip I gave the waitress because that's when she started acting like that. I asked what was wrong and she just responded by settling deeper into the seat. The next few minutes were completely silent and I just started heading towards her house.She abruptly blurted out a bit later that I was wasting my money and she couldn't believe I was so irresponsible. I asked her what was wrong with giving $100 to our waitress for her great service, and she said that I should have spent the money elsewhere, or at least given it to a deserving charity. Again, I reiterated that I felt it wasn't a big deal, and couldn't get a decent answer out of her.I took her home and without a word she just stepped out of my car, walked to her front door, opened the door, and walked without even turning her head back. Last night she texted me saying that I overtipped the waitress and asked how I felt about giving the waitress $100 when I haven't given her (my date) a single gift yet.

btkedl	AmItheAsshole	I might be the asshole and I am prepared to take whatever the judgement.I am married and have a daughter and a step daughter. I love them both dearly. But I am having a small problem when it comes to their birthday parties.The arrangement for the last few years has been that for my step-daughters birthday party, we go halves for it with her mother. Her birthday also happens to fall on a month where my partner and I get large bonuses (we work for the same company and together we get approx 4K extra on this month). Our salaries are not extravagant and this money always goes straight away on a holiday or to pay off student loan or something we need for the house.Over the last few years I have noticed my step daughters parties have really taken a ramp up. A few years ago we paid 70, and her mother paid 70. This year we paid 200 and her mother paid 200. I also feel it’s important to add that her mothers half gets paid for by her parents as she is a trainee nurse and lives at home with them. So personally, she sees no issue with making the parties as expensive as she can.Now half of the problem is that I do feel that 400 on a birthday party for a six year old is just ridiculous- however that was organised the mother and my partner just paid what she told him too.But the other half of the problem, is that my daughters birthday falls a few months before the bonus, straight after Christmas. So we are always feeling very tight for money. This year we had a few of her friends over to our house, spent approx 40 on food and drink and it was lovely. However when it came to my step-daughters birthday this year, my daughter got upset and asked why she couldn’t have such a big party. I explained that because of the situation she has two sets of parents paying for it and that she just has me and daddy.But I am starting to feel resentful about it and don’t want to make my daughter sad next year when 10x as much is spent on her step-sisters party than hers.So WIBTA if I mentioned to my husband that I feel like he should be more firm with his daughters mum on the limit of the cost of the party? I think it should be more in line with what we paid the first time (70ish), because there’s a lot we could do with the spare money and also it will feel more fair towards my daughter.

I told her how mad I was about the spending, and she said it cost $680 since she's a Verizon customer.She has no need for a phone that costs this much, and my own phone -- which I use every day for work -- was only $150. I thought she would spend something similar, and I just can't believe she dropped something like $700 ON A PHONE. She will literally only use it for family photos, Facebook and Amazon. $700 won't break us, but it's two car payments or 3/4 of a mortgage payment and I am super upset she spent that much.We are going on vacation this week, and I'm thinking about saying that she should return the phone and buy something cheaper after we get back.

cqctxj	AmItheAsshole	My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he’s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. Two weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would “try his best”. That afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said “if you’re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.”After that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. I called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would “look into it.” After a couple more days, he hadn’t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that “nobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he’s the best one at the school” (Which I sincerely doubt). I mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is “the nicest guy you’ll ever meet“ and that her children say my son is “extremely disruptive” on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn’t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.AITA?

c7ft94	AmItheAsshole	This is literally the hot topic of the day for my entire family and I’m fed up of being called an asshole so I’m going to ask on here. We are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. My 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. They were pretty close by. My son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. He had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. When we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. My mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blasé attitude towards belongings and she’s lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn’t attached to material things.I interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl ‘why don’t you ask (my son) since it’s his bike?’ She did and my son said no. She looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn’t seem bothered afterwards. My entire family looked at my like I was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me. I got a little defensive and told them that it was our sons toy to lend out as he pleased, and I was a little irritated to hear my mom say to my son ‘honey, sometimes it’s nice to share’ because he looked upset afterwards. l know that, he knows that, but it’s his new toy and he shouldn’t be made to feel bad over not wanting to share with a total stranger.

I'm the admin assistant, so I do a little bit of everything until we find out what I'm good at. The others in the company come from much different experiences and life backgrounds than me. On the PM side, it's mostly women, and they love to talk about all the things they buy, travel, etc. One of them pulled me into a conversation about travel and said we should all bring in passports to compare places we've been. I said ""Oh, I've never had a passport."" She was shocked, asked me why not. I just said ""Oh, I can't really afford to travel."" She looked confused and asked about when I was growing up, where would we go on family vacations. I said we didn't and changed the subject. She kept looking at me weird after that.Then came the purse thing. I've carried the same bag with me for about 6 years. One of the girls laughed at a fraying strap and said it was time for a new one, and suggested this brand I'd never heard of that kind of matched the style. I looked it up and said ""That's a really nice one! But wow, $150 for a purse!"" She looked at me funny and said ""Do you think that's a lot...?""

They were all shocked and kept trying to tell me why I was wrong, and I admit I got a little annoyed when they wouldn't drop it. I said ""With what money?""It got awkward after that, and the next day one of the women pulled me aside and told me that they're sick of the way I always have to be a downer about money, and that I always make it awkward when I talk about what I can't afford. I said ""Well, how do you think it makes me feel to have you guys constantly flaunting all the purses and high end makeup and designer clothes you're wearing."" She said that they were bonding, that's what women do, and that from now on, I should try to be more discrete about the income disparity between us. I said ""Sure, if you guys will be, so will I."" She gave me a look and said that I'm acting kind of like an asshole and punishing them for something that's not their fault.

From even before my wife exams pregnant she’s always been interested in reading stuff and watching videos about pregnancies, birth and raising children. She literally started buying baby clothes before she even got pregnant. Obviously we are both very excited for this baby.However when my wife got pregnant she started talking about how she wanted a home birth and how she has a friend who did it and her friend recommended it. She started watching all these YouTube videos about home birth and said that for normal pregnancies home births had lower rates of maternal morbidity and intervention. It’s something she became very excited about. Honestly I know it’s her body but I just put my foot down. My sister had x normal pregnancy throughout the whole pregnancy and ended up having an emergency c-section. In my opinion ANYTHING could go wrong and I didn’t want to risk my wife’s life or my baby’s life just so my wife could have the experience of home-birth. I want the assurance of the medical interventions at the hospital. I have completely let her decide everything else concerning our baby, I eagerly agreed to do parenting classes and labor and delivery classes. I agreed to have a doula for the birth. I’m taking 6 weeks paternity leave to help her with the baby 100% and anything else concerning delivery she can decide but I just refused to let her have a home birth.

I was angry and hurt, and also began to question every other time he told me he was working late, or going out with the guys. Before this incident, I trusted him without question. He was apologetic, and I asked that he cut off contact with this person. She has a history of pursuing married men, and in fact they broke up when he proposed and she confessed to chatting with a married man.     Last November, I discovered that he had not cut off contact, that they had met several times, and when confronted he insisted that he only agreed to delete her number. He claims that they are just friends, that I'm overreacting, and that I should trust him. He will not stop seeing her.

I'm losing sleep, I have trouble enjoying sex, I have a hard time getting out of bed some days. I don't want to leave my marriage, as we have a child together.

I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.​Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.​Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""Me: ""It's John.""​Ted: ""What?""​Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack.

I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""​His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""​Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.​Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""​(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)​As promised, I ignored him.​7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call.

Come pick me up.""E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.​I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off.

But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here.

d36k6b	AmItheAsshole	This is from years ago but bad feelings still come up.1. My husband had a psychotic break and was detained under the mental health act. Diagnosed with bipolar. No previous incidents.2. I have a young child from a previous relationship who was at summer camp during the breakdown, so fortunately did not witness anything.Who, if anyone, is TA in the things that happened after?a. My husband's parents were around and even went with him when the police took him to hospital (he had been running round our neighborhood naked and screaming). However they had a holiday booked and went a couple of days later. It was just a local trip to see family. They would have lost a couple of hundred pounds. I think they should have stayed to offer support during that stressful time. AITA?b. Children's services said they needed to do an assessment to see if it would be safe for my young child to live with someone who had had a breakdown and that we could not live under the same roof until after the assessment. Fine. His parents said that me and my child should move out of the house my husband and I rented (we both paid the rent) to live with my parents, who lived 2 hours away. That would mean I would have to quit my job and the little one move school.They did not want him to live with them (they have a spare room) because it would disrupt their routine. They said I was selfish for not 'letting him recover in familiar surroundings'. That's stupid because he would need supervision after coming out of hospital. In the end he went with them. AITA for not moving out?c. He ended up staying for a year at his parents house until children's services was satisfied he was stable on his medication that had been prescribed. From day 1 they charged him the standard amount of rent for renting out a room. He still had all his normal bills and rent coming out of his account (luckily illness insurance was covering that). This was their spare bedroom and I'm sure they are in government subsidised housing already. Basically they made a profit from their son who had just come out of a mental hospital. I pointed this out and they banned me for visiting for 'being rude'. AITA for calling them out?d. Just after being discharged from hospital he had a mental health assessment at (their) home. The dad went out shopping and the mum was 'asleep upstairs after a night shift'. Without being too specific, they both work in hospital settings and know full well that if the assessment had not gone well he could have ended up back in hospital. Even worse he was saying stuff like 'I murdered the president, I murdered my mother' obviously not true, but should not have been left alone with a government person without them to note what he  actually said. I said 'why the hell did you leave him alone with them?' they said 'oh we thought they just wanted to see the house'. I said that's asinine. AITA ?

apfejh	AmItheAsshole	Hello, long time follower, first time poster. So my boyfriend knows that I have a lot of body image issues. I am a little overweight, and I struggle with it. I’ve tried a myriad of different diet plans and exercise routines over the years, but nothing seems to stick. My boyfriend and I both really want to have a big family, and I’ve confided in him before that I can’t wait to have a baby, but the thought of being pregnant gives me a lot of anxiety because I don’t want to gain weight.So last night he calls me out of the blue, and says he just wanted to say “I love you so much, and I can’t wait to marry you and have babies with you because you’ll make such a wonderful mother...” and my heart is so full hearing this, and then he goes “...but I can’t have you go and ballooning up each pregnancy. You’ll be 300 pounds by the time we’re done having kids, and I’m not having sex with no big fat slob” and when I pushed back, he doubled down and set me guidelines of how much weight I am allowed to gain each pregnancy, and that after birth, I’ll get one month to “relax”, then two months to get back to my pre-baby weight, and then I’ll get pregnant again, and repeat.  So we fought about it. I said he was being insensitive, and treating me like a sex-and-baby machine and not a human being. He tried to say he was only worried about my health (his dad died when he was a child from diabetes) and I was okay with that argument, but in trying to explain his health concerns, he kept digressing into such gems as: I’m not gonna stay married to you if i don’t get hard looking at youDo you want our kids to be embarrassed by you? Do you want them to say “daddy, can you drop us off as school instead of mommy, because the other kids make fun of the way mommy waddles?I love you, but my love is conditional, and the condition is not gaining more than 30 pounds. When the scale hits 31, I’m signing the divorce papers.If you told me not to weigh 300 lbs, I’d say “sure thing, babe, you’re right” but the fact that you won’t agree to it means that you must actually WANT to weigh 300 lbs, so if that’s your goal, good luck but we’re breaking up if that’s what you wantDo you want our kids to be fat fucks too? You want to give them insulin shots in kindergarten because you and the babies sit on the couch all day feeding each other Ding Dongs? We’ve had a lot of fights in the past around my boyfriend being blunt by nature, and me being overly sensitive by nature, but I really think he was out of line. And the whole conversation came out of nowhere, which really makes me feel like my weight is something that was just eating away at him and he had to get it off his chest. But should I just let it go if he insists he’s only worried about my health? With his family history, it’s understandable that he’d worry about obesity and have a bit of a complex around it, and he is insisting that he’s not asking for too much so I should just agree to it since gaining minimal weight is also what I want, so I shouldn’t fight him and we just be in agreement?

cw8fe0	AmItheAsshole	Basically I woke up in the middle of the night and my tonsil was super inflamed and had white spots all over it. Pain was easily a 9/10 so I popped some ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation and drove to the hospital. I arrived at midnight, they didn't see me until 2 a.m. Doctor comes over at around 3 a.m. and tells me that I have a peritonsillar abscess. For those of you who don't know it's basically a bacterial infection that can be the result of untreated tonsillitis among other things. Normally my tonsils get inflamed when I am not feeling well so I probably had it for a week or so and didn't realize it had progressed so quickly. Back on topic. The doctor comes over with a bunch of nurses and asks if I want to call anyone since they'll need to drain it. Still realizing it was 3 a.m. (now closer to 4) I tell them no, just go ahead. They numb me up after giving me some IV fentanyl, and drain my tonsils. I stay for the day to recover and they send me home the next morning.Later that week I was having dinner at my grandparents and I was talking with my brother. Just normal banter complaining about trivial stuff and I bring up the operation and how I was super tired from not having slept well in the hospital and still had to go to work. My mom overhears and freaks out, tells my dad. Now I have both of them as well as some other people in my family saying I should have told them I was in the hospital and my parents are insinuating that I don't care about them.I didn't tell them for a number of reasons. One, them being at the hospital wouldn't have changed anything. The doctor did the surgery and I had my phone to keep me company. Their presence wouldn't really have helped the situation in any way. Two, I'm over 18 and on my own insurance so I don't feel like I have to tell them anything regarding my medical history. Lastly, even if I did tell them after it wouldn't have mattered because the surgery was over and I don't understand how it would benefit anyone by bringing it up. I know this is very tame compared to most posts on here, but I am not very good with understanding people and emotions and it is something I am working to improve on. So I guess I am asking if IATA because I want to make sure I wasn't callous or cold towards them in any way?Tl;dr Didn't tell parents I was in the hospital, they got upset, am I a heartless douchebag?

chbp4l	AmItheAsshole	My girlfriend Jackie is literally so slow to decide on anything. Restaurants are the worst. We went out for dinner last night and I was already dreading the ordering as soon as we walked in. We get the menus and Jackie doesn’t even look at the menu. She starts talking about her day and then the waitress comes back and asks us if we know what we wanna order yet. Jackie has still barely glanced at the menu and I can feel myself getting more and more pissed off and annoyed.She then gets up and goes the the washroom and the waitress comes back afterwards. She says she’ll come back when Jackie is back but I stop her and say that she told me to order for her. I order something for Jackie and she comes back from the washroom. I told her that she took so long and was being embarrassing so I ordered for her.She didn’t say much and got quiet the rest of the night. Which was fine by me. When we got home she told me that she didn’t “appreciate me speaking on her behalf” but I just told her that I wouldn’t have to if she didn’t take so long. AITA?

av7rbh	AmItheAsshole	My boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. &amp;#x200B;He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

byz6zb	AmItheAsshole	I'm going on a cruise with basically all of my in-laws and two friends. We're splitting a 2 bedroom with the two also childless friends. The parenting adults have family suites.My SILs are starting to ask if they can use our room to breastfeed/pump, which would turn into letting their kids chill out there as well. The 4 non-parent adults want the space to remain adults only, and maintain the expectation that there may at any time be R-rated things going on (sex, drunk assholes, adult games, etc). My husband has no backbone for his family and is nicer than me, so he'll probably let these women chill here.WIBTA if I maintain the expectation and decline to care if a child happens to see adult things if they go into our rooms? Honestly our friends are... passionate enough that it's very common to walk in on them preoccupied even announced, let alone unannounced.I brought this up with a few coworkers and they were appalled. In my family of origin, if a child is told not to enter a place and they do, what they view is on the parents, or them if they're old enough.

b2wgt0	AmItheAsshole	A few notes; I have a full sized truck, live in an apartment building, and have an infant still in a huge reverse car seat. Getting the kiddo in and out of the truck requires the door to be pretty far open and I'm terrified of hitting another car with the door so I park as close to the opposite line as I can without being on it. This leaves my passenger side with a crap ton of room and allows me not to worry. This doesn't leave much room for me to get out or the person next to me to get in so I always try to park in the last spot but it's not always available. I pull in my mirrors when next to another large vehicle to try and help with the spacing but am I still the asshole for knowingly giving the other person less room to get in and out if I'm still technically in my spot?

His mother has always been overbearing and mothers him quite a lot. My boyfriend's birthday is in early December, then there's Christmas, and our anniversary is in early January. Of course, then there's Valentine's Day only a couple of months later. Instead of buying him four sets of presents (which would be impossible because men are already hard to buy for) I thought I could do something that combines all four events and book for us to go to Rome for a few days next summer. My boyfriend and I both work, so this gives us plenty of time to save and I thought it would be the perfect present, instead of just buying socks and aftershave again. So, I buy the tickets for June next year, and put them in an envelope. His birthday was yesterday, and he was over the moon when he saw the tickets. My boyfriend has never travelled out of the country before and does not have a passport because his mother is terrified of flying, so they never did. I told him I would pay for him to get the passport so all he would have to accumulate is spending money. When my bf told his mom about the present, she acted happy and then took me aside while bf was talking to his family. She asked me why I thought it was appropriate to do this without asking her, with her reasons for it being inappropriate being: * He lives at home with his parents so they have the right to know where he is. * He might be 'needed at home' during those days. * She is terrified of flying and I should have cleared it with her that her anxiety would be able to cope with it. This made me super angry, because her anxiety has affected my boyfriend so many times and it's not fair.

You have seven months to make arrangements for if you need some help. You have seven months to grow up and let your son be an adult for once."" and then I left.

aglogu	AmItheAsshole	My ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.A few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.The one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.This was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.

bdw6an	AmItheAsshole	"Some background is in order and I'm using a throwaway. I have history with my BIL that predates him dating and marrying my sister. In college he dated a good friend of mine and I was certain (still am) he was cheating on her so I told her and she dumped him. He lies about it to this day but needless to say we don't get along. When he started dating my sister I tried to warn her about him but she was so ""in love"" she refused to heed my warnings. They've been married for 18 years and I'm certain there's infidelity and abuse but I have no proof and my sister cuts me off when I bring it up. So to the crux of the issue. Two weeks ago I picked my nephew (11) up from baseball. I asked him how things were going and asked him if he had any issues he'd like to talk to me about. He said no so I asked if he'd been offered drugs. He sort of perked up and said no but that his dad said ""I don't care if you do cocaine or smoke pot."" I was livid so I stormed into their house and tried to discuss with my BIL. He said he was too busy to talk and asked if I was freaking out about ""nonsense"" again. I told him this was about what he said to my nephew. He said to stay out of he and his kids business and he wasn't even comfortable with me driving the kid and would talk to my sister about it. I stormed out and thought about what I should do. So the next morning I went directly to the kids principal and told her what I'd heard. She profusely thanked me and said she would address the issue. I was very happy that at least some sort off authority figure knew. Later in the day I got a text from niece saying ""Aunt Shana, what did you tell the principal?"" I told her that was adult stuff. She texted back ""My dad never said we should do drugs!"" I told her ""honey, let the adults handle this ok."" Her response was ""he told us that he doesn't care if we do drugs like smoke pot but he wants us to realize that if we do drugs, we have to get them from drug dealers who can be really awful people! Please take this back!"" I told her again that if that's what he said it's just as bad and she needed to let the adults handle this. I got a text from my sister later that night saying ""please leave my kids out of whatever your issue is today."" I told her ""I'm always here to talk about what is truly going on in your house."" Well fast forward to late last week and I guess my sister and BIL got a visit from our state's version of CPS. CPS called me, I told them the truth that I feel my BIL is abusive and an adulterer and the thing about the drugs. My sister called me later that day apoplectic at what I'd done, so did my parents and other siblings. Everyone is furious with me. I told my sister that I was always here for her if she ever wanted to talk about the abuse I know she receives from my BIL and she told me that she never wants to speak to my ""fat, ugly ass ever again"" and hung up.I am basically ostracized from my niece and nephew so I want an honest opinion, was I the asshole here?"

cubq3j	AmItheAsshole	The setup: I’ve known this guy for a couple years and we’ve worked together occasionally. We’ve had a couple dates before. We split the bill without any discussion or issue. He Snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. I say sure.I forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied “pizza and a movie” and he replied “yeah see you soon!” It was just an innocent phrase but I didn’t eat that day and assumed we’d get food together.I show up and he has the movie. I say “so are we getting food?” He says “I already ate. But I’m sure you have apps on your phone if you want something.” Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.I sit there awkwardly. This guy previously talked about being a men’s rights guy. A normal one, not an incel dickhead. He also mentioned he’s low on cash. But isn’t it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? If he was too broke I’d obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn’t the vibe I got since he bragged about a new game he bought. He returns and turns on the TV and turns off all the lights. Then he goes into the kitchen, which I assume is to get alcohol. I call out casually “what do you got to drink?” He calls back “Do you like tap water?”This is not some red pill bullshit. I know this guy, he’s serious. There’s nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. I call out, “Yeah, sure.”He brings me back a glass of tap water. He winks at me.I’m starving. I haven’t eaten since 8am. I say “Hey, I don’t wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza.” He says in a sympathetic tone, “Oh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn’t clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.”This is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn’t offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. After the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he’s weird with money and I’m uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn’t think my pizza was his responsibility. Then he asks me to have sex with him.I decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.I don’t expect or need people to buy me things, but I think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners.

dal01x	AmItheAsshole	I live in a small town on the coast of NC with my husband and kids. The town is about 300 years old and it has maintained historical buildings and traditions to promote tourism and historical interest. Our house is, IMO, quite beautiful. Google the Hamptons White House, it's almost identical to that house.As it's a historical area there are numerous tours to see the old cemetary, jail, courthouse, various historical homes. Blackbeard once graced our town and his ship is actually sunken off the coast.Our house is near the historical district but our neighborhood is new and our house is not part of the history. A couple days ago I let my kids go out and play in the sprinkler in the front yard while I cleaned and after a while I noticed people leaning on my fence with their phones put so I went out to investigate. They said they were walking the historical trail and my house was so pretty they wanted photos.I pointed out that the historical path is three blocks up and those properties have large plaques denoting their historical value. They said they k ow but my house was just so nice they couldn't resist and they didnt want to pay for the tour. I pointed out my kids were very obviously playing and they were half-dressed in their swim suits and their photos had been taken, and that the house was obviously a private home. I added I wanted the photos deleted as I didnt want my kids photos going off with them when they're in their bathing suits. If we had been out in public it would have been different but this is my home behind a fence. I asked how they would have felt if I followed them home and did what they were doing. They argued with me for a few minutes.They told me they wouldnt delete the photos and if I wanted privacy I should have built a taller fence.

One of my good female friends, who always calls me out on my bs, smacked the side of my arm and said it was gross how men stare at women when they walk by and that women aren’t pieces of meat. I was pretty tipsy by this point and I said that “If she didn’t want people to stare at her like that then why would she wear that outfit? I mean isn’t that the point? If she didn’t want to be stared at then maybe she should wear something else.”My friend got super pissed at me and said that she thought that “I was better than that” and that I was victim blaming. She said that some women wear those clothes to make themselves feel better and not to get attention. I tried to explain that I wasn’t victim blaming at all but why else would she dress like that besides wanting people to look at her? And even if she was dressing like that to feel good about herself, she should still expect people to look. We went back and forth like this for a while before I had to go to the bathroom and it didn’t come up again that night. My friend is still pissed at me (in a more light hearted way though) and she says that I need to “change my perspective”. I really do get some of what she’s saying but I also think that I’m not entirely out of line on this. So AITA for staring and saying that she should wear something different if she doesn’t want to get looked at?

cu4bdr	AmItheAsshole	Throwaway account because I am not sure if my brother uses reddit .A little back story my older half brother who I didn’t know growing up and lives out of state recently went through a very nasty divorce that he actually hid from me for about a year. I have heard multiple sides to the story as to what led to the break up but it all basically goes back to my brother turning very cold hearted towards his wife, eventually cheating on her followed up by lots of mind games. I am extremely close to his ex wife and I love her very deeply. Since she is the mother of my niece and nephew I have made it clear to my brother I am not choosing sides in this divorce because of the fact that she’s their mother. Which he supports.I am getting married in two months and I invited both my brother and his ex wife to my wedding. His ex has made it pretty clear she does not intend to go to the wedding because my brother will be in attendance which I understand. While my brother has recently been pestering me to allow him to take his new girlfriend to the wedding. His new girlfriend is the same girl he cheated with which makes me uncomfortable as well as my other sisters. Since I invited his ex wife I feel as if it is rude  to let him bring the girl who he cheated with to the wedding.  I have expressed this to him and originally he understood. But he’s been asking me repeatedly now. Today he gave me an ultimatum that if she can’t go he will not go. I expressed to him that if that’s how he felt about it I would be sad by his decision but would understand but I wasn’t changing my mind. As soon as he saw I wasn’t backing off he took it back and than confessed she is 6months pregnant. This came as a shocker, I congratulated him but said that didn’t change my mind and the conversation was over. One of my sisters says I’m an asshole for not letting her go considering now she will be the mother to our niece or nephew while my other sister says she shouldn’t go to the wedding.It’s important to note my sisters and I have no issue with meeting her in general, we just want it to be in a neutral situation  not at the wedding. I feel like it’s ridiculous to meet her for the first time at my wedding because of how busy I will be and for whatever reason my brother says we can not meet her prior due to scheduling. I honestly just don’t want wedding day drama.Am I the asshole for not letting my brother take his pregnant girlfriend to my wedding?

eg6w2b	AmItheAsshole	I LOVE reading the plots of big blockbuster movies before I see them (specifically the MCU films).  I just want to know the story as soon as humanly possible and then see it come to life on the big screen. I NEVER, EVER spoil the movie for anyone (unless privately asked to), but I did used to tell people that I had read it. I admit, I liked the mortified reactions of people and it always lead to —playfully—heated discussions. My wife couldn’t stand that I did this and asked me to stop so we could “experience the movie together.” Me already knowing the story going on ruined the movie for her. I didn’t understand that reasoning and it honestly bothered me a little. I never spoiled a movie for anyone and it never affected anyone else but her. I got over pretty quickly and I dropped the subject, but never said I would stop. I ended up reading the plot to Avengers Endgame, but I kept my mouth shut. I didn’t tell a single soul that I had read it. The wife and I went and saw it and loved it. She laughed, she cried, she had the best time and said she genuinely had a great “experience.”On the ride home, she asked if I read the plot beforehand. I really didn’t want to lie, so I said yes I did. She got upset and said that I had retro-actively ruined the movie for her, the same movie she had claimed to love 30 minutes ago. AITA here? I truly don’t see how I harmed her. I know she asked me to stop, but does that mean I have to, even if it doesn’t hurt anyone and I didn’t spoil the movie or make a big show about it? Can she dictate what I can and can’t do if it doesn’t affect her? Should I have lied?Keep in mind, this is not a serious source of contention between us. Just a disagreement on ideals.

bjdrt9	AmItheAsshole	"I live on an Island in the Pacific. My husband is really into freediving and spearfishing and got me into it as well. His best friend and dive partner (BF) has a boat we take out regularly. Since his friend got the boat, I've always gone topless on it. It's not like I'm laying out in a g-string topless, it more when we get out of the water we all take off our wetsuits and put on board shorts. My husband and his best friend aren't bothered by me going topless at all. I once asked his friend if he had an issue with it and he responded ""if I don't have to wear a shirt why should you?"" Cue a recent dive trip. My husband's BF brought a friend who is Mormon. Mormon didn't have his own gun so I let him borrow mine. He could barely get past thirty feet. Had no clue what he was doing. He was a total kook.We dive at one spot for a while and decide to go check someplace else. I get out of the water first, change into board shorts and start helping my husband and his BF get their guns and gear back on the boat. The Mormon guy doesn't come back on the boat right away. I go to store some stuff and my husband comes up and says ""BF asked nicely if you could put a top on, Mormon is uncomfortable."" I asked if he was serious and he said yes, I needed to put a top on. I put a shirt on (I didn't even bring a bikini top), but I was not happy. I went to the bow of the ship, pulled up a book on my phone and skipped the next dive. My husband could tell that I was upset, but I was polite to everyone the rest of the day and no one else noticed I was pissed.  Later that night my husband, BF and I went to dinner. BF casually mentioned me having to put a shirt on. I told him and my husband that they discriminated against me because I'm a woman, to make a Mormon guy, who apparently thinks tits needs to be hidden, more comfortable. (Note: I know it's not actionable illegal discrimination. Also, there is no law against female toplessness where I live). That it wasn't cool.They are both very liberal guys. Both denied it was discrimination. I argued that it's even though it's not in the same world as what some people face, and as far as discrimination goes is relatively harmless, it was still sexist and discriminatory. They continued to deny it was discrimination in any way shape or form. I said that we were all wearing the exact same outfit, but I had to change mine, solely because I'm a woman. That makes it discrimination on the basis of sex. I told my husband that if Mormon goes again I don't want to go. Husband and BF think I'm being an asshole about it and I should just put a shirt on since it doesn't hurt me. I think husband and BF are being assholes by forcing me to change my behavior to make some other sexist asshole more comfortable.   Who is the asshole here?"

ck3a2y	AmItheAsshole	"So there's this guy that has been getting closer to my gf for a little over a year now to the point where he would literally do anything for her like drive her anywhere or just come over to keep her company while she studies since I prefer to study on my own (grad school is tough). To be fair, we have a strong level of trust towards one another and I in particular almost never get jealous or insecure about her guy friends since I know she wouldn't ever cheat. However, everyone knows that this guy is madly in love with her and the amount of effort he puts into trying to be all cute and good to her makes me uncomfortable, which is very new for me. I have continuously voiced how i felt about the amount of times he comes over to keep her company while studying (lives over an hour away) and she usually replies with ""its a tough semester and since you can't i just really need someone to keep my company"". I am unable to go to Europe with her and she's been wanting to go all her life, and with the summer off she asked if she could ask him and I was at first 100% no, asking her to ask a family friend i knew would want to go and she doesnt get along too well with her so she asked me to reconsider. To be perfectly honest I was very taken aback by the fact that she would even ask this knowing how uncomfortable he makes me feel and idk i guess i was also hurt at the fact that she's not taking my concerns seriously, so as of now this turned into a bit of an argument.

bcrt4w	AmItheAsshole	Keeping it short. I live with 3 people, 1 guy 2 girls (I’m a girl too.) The guy and I are good friends and we help each other with small favors from time to time. We’re all in university. Over spring break I told him I didn’t know where to go yet because I didn’t have a car. He said he’s going home to see family so I could use his car to drive to spring break stuff with friends. I thought that was super nice as his car is very nice as well (Mercedes SUV). So he goes home and I get my best friends together for a spring break road trip. We end up driving to Las Vegas from Maryland which was a huge drive but super fun. When I get back my roommate asks how the trip was and I tell him and he FREAKS OUT. He said he assumed we were just gonna drive to the beach or something, like just a few hours away, not almost to the west coast. I told him he didn’t say anything about distance when he lent the car to me, and it’s unfair to get mad at me when he didn’t bother to say anything. We’ve been fighting since but my other roommates think I should apologize. I don’t think I did anything wrong however but open to other judgment.

ap1wkc	AmItheAsshole	"There was this night we had studied together at his place and I stayed the night. It was rather uncomfortable from the get-go because he was saying he wasn't feeling well, but he didn't have a fever and didn't think it was serious. Anyway he was very agitated in bed.   I had finally fallen asleep, when I woke up and found the lights on, and my BF kneeling in front of a puddle of vomit on his carpet. I ask what's going on and he says like ""sorry, do you think you can help me clean? Keep falling down"" He was speaking weird like speaking was annoying him. I told him he couldn't make me clean after his own mess and he was cryptic and I think now he said something like he thought he was allowed to ask but he wasn't making demands.   Anyway he's just staying there doing nothing and I start telling him the smell is horrible. He tells me to take the blankets and go sleep on the couch. I tell him he should just ckean it up he says like ""sorry can't clean"". I leave the room to go for the couch and I just see him lie down on the carpet next to the puddle and I ask what he's doing. He says like ""can't get up. Need sleep"".   Next morning I find him asleep there on the ground. The smell is horrible. I wake him up and tell him he must take care of it now. He says he will but he is barely moving and is also not getting ready. (He has to be at work in an hour). I had to leave for school. At the lunch pause I had given it enough thoughts that that experience had been disgusting and he was trying to get me to clean it up as he wasn't touching it. So I texted him to tell him I didn't want to date someone with that flaw of character and I was breaking up with him. He responded that he understood and thanking me for the good times.   Since then our friends have been texting me nonstop that I'm the worst partner in the world if I will not help someone who has a stomach flu.   I've asked my brother and my dad to go fetch my thing I left at his place but he refused to let them in. My friends say I'm terrible for that too because I didn't tell him they would come, and he couldn't have boxed my stuff and it's normal he wouldn't want to invite them in his place so they can just grab my things themselves. He says he would have given them my tablet but he couldn't because they'd force themselves in if he did.

cgxlli	AmItheAsshole	I’m posting this from my wife’s account and both perspectives are included. I, the husband, am asking if I’m the asshole. This is a topic we’ve been debating for the past almost two years now. It’d be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. My perspective (husband):My wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. After eating something delicious, I can’t quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I’m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. Over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn’t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. Once they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife’s contractions started to pick up. Am I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?Wife’s perspective:My husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he’d complain I’d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. So as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn’t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. I did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. I’d like to also mention it wasn’t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. He is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?

Having to clarify that made me uncomfortable, so I simply skipped that part and remained awkwardly silent and after stating my neighborhood. I was not the only one who did so. But later my friend who went with me asked me why, and I replied ""I'm just not comfortable and it didn't strike me as necessary"" she made a bit of a fuss about how it's ""no big deal"" and how saying ""she/her"" takes about a second.

d78nmj	AmItheAsshole	My younger sister has been nagging me to take care of her child while she and her husband go out on date nights for a while now. I don't like children and I've always refused her but after being worn down by costant begging I gave in. Now I'm in this shitty situation.To cut a long story short her son arrives and *immediately* starts causing shit. Running around the place, demanding to eat all my snacks, opening my things to look around for toys, and demanding attention constantly. I tell him to watch TV and just let me relax but he seems determined not to listen to a word I said. Finally I get him to calm down and sit after bribing him with ice cream I was saving for the weekend he shuts up and finally settles down. Or so I think.I go back to my room to browse reddit and try to relax but after a while I hear my cat let out a giant yowl. I immediately run to investigate and find the little shit standing there with my cat backed into a corner, back raised and hissing. He immediately backs away when he sees me but I just know he's done some shit and after I question him and he breaks out crying and saying he just wanted to play a game with the cat. When I go to take him back to the lounge to sit down I see not only has he been harassing my cat, he's smeared ice cream all over my new **white** couch and on the carpet below. I should add in here he is a 7 year old not 3, there is no reason for him to make such a mess other than a basic lack of respect. At this point I am really angry, especially after seeing my poor baby in a state because of him, but trying to keep it cool. I tell him he's to clean the mess he made but then he starts to throw an almighty tantrum and start screaming and crying at the idea of having to face a consequence for the mess he has created. I've had it by now and I tell him he's going to sit in a room until he can calm down and behave and not terrorize my cat and cause giant messes in my house. I take him to the guest room and shut the door and say he can come out only when he starts acting properly. Spoiler alert, he cries the entire time which is honestly ridiculous and he's still there and sobbing when his lovely mother and her darling hubby arrive to pick him up.They **FREAK** the fuck out at me and it ends up with them storming out. Now my mother and brother are blowing up my phone with a biased story straight out of my dear sisters mouth about how I shouted at and scared her son for no reason and locked him in a room. I know that (quite luckily) I'm not my nephews mother, and my sister seems to think that means I have no right to punish him.

My wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. That is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. So I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  FF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. Next step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   But NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. So I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. She says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it.

bshoay	AmItheAsshole	I’m writing this from my friend’s basement since I was kicked out of my house for this one a few days ago. My wife and I are in our mid-40’s and no kids and solid jobs in finance here in the US. My wife is from a foreign country, we met and got married in our mid-20’s. However, most of her family is from her home country in Asia including her parents who she flies out to USA once or twice a year and stays for an extended period of time before they go back home. Her parents are in their 80’s.6 months ago my wife’s mother was diagnosed with a type of colon cancer and in her country there is not the advanced type of care required for this. My wife wanted her parents to come live with us permanently and seek treatment in the US and I agreed because it’s obviously the right thing to do for her family. Her mother’s prognosis was fairly grim and it was found that the disease was spreading; and we were given the options of either aggressive chemotherapy or the latter which is to make her as comfortable as she can in her final months. My wife and family opted for the chemo which I was onboard with even though they have no insurance and each treatment was a huge hit to our savings. After 4-5 months of treatment and piling medical bills in excess of $400,000, the treatments are still ongoing. I plan on calling the hospital and try to negotiate that down to maybe half the amount since I read on reddit on another thread that this might be possible, but as it stands currently if I paid all of this it would wipe out all of our savings, plus about half of my 401k after withdrawal penalties are calculated. I’ve been supportive and willing to take on the financial burden although I’ve thought to myself that it is time to give up. I’ve never said this to my wife or her family and have been outwardly supportive, but inside I’ve been struggling and worried about the future.A few days ago I was at a bar with my friend and discussing my true feelings about the entire situation. The bar was a little loud so I did have to speak up a little bit in order to hold the conversation. I told my friend that I’ve been feeling inundated with these bills ever since the the midpoint of the treatments, and again, although I have put on a smile and want the best for my Wife’s family, internally I wanted the financial bleeding to stop and just wanted my mother in law to die comfortably in hospice care. Unfortunately, my wife’s best friend was sitting behind us at the bar unbeknownst to me and heard all of this. She called my wife right away.My wife and I had a huge argument when I got home and I guess my argument the entire time was that my actions of supporting the medical treatments should have been enough and, quoting a show I recently watched, that “thoughts are not treason”. None of this went over well and hence why I’m out of the house.So reddit, AITA???

c8mz7a	AmItheAsshole	I’m a university student, second year. Met my girlfriend in the first year, never had big arguments, only silly little things, though she has been known to over react to situations, anyway I digress. It was half term and I was home from uni, my friends ask if I want to go and see a film, so we do. A few days later me and my gf are FaceTiming, she asks me if I want to go and see the same film when We get back to university. She seemed very excited about the film and it was nice to see, I like seeing her happy. I say, sure we can go and see it and that was the end of that. Fast forward to when we are all back to university. It comes out at a party from one of my home friends (who also goes to my uni) that we went and saw the film at home. She gets absolutely furious claiming that I had lied to her, saying “if your willing to lie about something so small as a movie, what else could you lie about”. I get the cold shoulder for a day or two. I try to speak with her a few times in those days but she doesn’t want to see me. At this point my friends thought this was ridiculous that someone could get so annoyed over something so small. I just liked seeing her so excited about something and didn’t want to spoil that. I’m a very non confrontational person. I ended up apologising even though I didn’t really feel like I should.

ayobbg	AmItheAsshole	Throwaway because I'm just a lurker with no intention of becoming a regular poster; just wanted some third-party opinions on this particular issue. A little backstory to set context:About two years ago I started dating the woman I'm currently with. After casually dating for a couple months she ended up getting pregnant. We moved in together shortly after to save money in preparation for the baby. I already owned my home so we decided to move her and her dog into my house with my two dogs. Here's where the problem begins. She is a nurse working the night-shift. She felt guilty about crating her dog at night to train him properly and basically let him use the restroom wherever/whenever he wanted in her apartment. When she moved in I told her that I would be happy to train her dog as I did with my boys but that we had to start immediately as I did not want him ruining the house and I was acutely aware that we would have zero time/energy to devote to dog training once the baby was born. She agreed but immediately undermined any efforts I made to train him - she would let him out of the crate during his crate time, get upset at me for reprimanding him (spray bottle squirt, a stern NO, and/or a light tap on the nose), and eventually told me that she would just take care of training him. Fast forward to present day. Her dog is not trained at all. He growls at me, has bitten me on two occasions, consistently pees/poops under our bed, peed on our son's playpen a month ago and finally tonight shat in his room at the foot of his crib, waking him up and driving me to post this at 2 AM. I am genuinely worried about our son's health and safety at this point. Her dog is only 10 pounds so his bites didn't do much damage to me but he could absolutely hurt a 7 month old child. On top of that, he's peeing/pooping in areas that our son plays and sleeps. I have told her for the last 6 months or so, on a fairly regular basis, that we need to find a new home for him as I'm now completely unable to train him even if she would let me and I still wanted to - between taking care of the baby, my two dogs, the chaos of her night-shift schedule, and me hunting for a new job/getting my Master's &amp; CPA I literally just don't have the ability to. When he woke the baby up tonight it was my final straw. I texted her that I would be bringing him to a no-kill shelter this weekend as she had not put any effort into finding him a new home on her own. She wrote back a few angry things and has now stopped talking to me. I absolutely love dogs and animals in general but I'm down to 5 hours of sleep on a good night. I didn't want it to come to this and attempted to get in front of the issue with her by training before the baby came but, as I said, she interceded. At this stage I'm worried that it's driving a wedge between she and I during a time that's already pretty stressful. AITA? &amp;#x200B;	EXPERT	Is the dog out of control?	<EXPERT_PCT_1_AUTHOR>	She's a nurse and refuses to admit that a dog crapping in the baby's space is a health hazard?	<EXPERT_PCT_0_AUTHOR>	real
bqu4jq	AmItheAsshole	So I realize I’m probably the asshole here. Looking for unbiased responses. I work in marketing and in my department there are 3-4 women who either have ridiculously wealthy families or have married very wealthy men (our jobs are not that high paying themselves). They talk a lot about expensive things like clothes, shoes, vacations etc. It can get annoying because they very obviously look down on some of our lifestyles. Last Friday one girl came in with a HUGE diamond ring. It was honestly kinda tacky in my opinion but I didn’t say anything. Someone asked her how much it was and she said it was 45k!!! I was speechless honestly, but she married this private equity guy who could afford it I guess. Later in the day I was chatting with some other coworkers and I said that I feel like wearing a 45k ring while people in this world are dying of poverty means you’re objectively a bad, morally empty person. I didn’t say it to her directly, but several people were nearby. The people I was talking to all agreed and said it was excessive and not classy at all. Last night I got a text from my boss saying that word has been spreading that I’m “bullying” this girl and we need to have a chat sometime this week. I’m not sure how casual talk like that can count as bullying but I can see where I maybe went overboard. Now I’m not sure if I should defend myself or just admit fault and apologize when the meeting comes. AITA?

eculal	AmItheAsshole	So I’m 27 my wife is 26 and our son is 4. Now let me just preface this by saying I was told by my parents at a very young age and I’ve always felt that I’d do the same for my kids. Our son loves Christmas and always goes crazy with excitement. So up until now I’ve gone along with my wife on it. Out Well a couple nights ago it was just our son and I home at night, my wife was out with her friends. We were on the couch together and he saw a santa commercial and he was like ohh Santa, Santa soon and I saw it as an opportunity to tell him the truth about the holiday. He then started getting upset about it and I tried calming him down telling him that he will still get everything that he wants. I didn’t see the problem with it because I was being honest with him and I don’t wanna deceive him. A couple hours later my wife comes home and of course he runs over to her and tells her about it. She was furious with me about it, but I told her that I felt it’s justified because I’m being honest with our son. AITA?

cri9nw	AmItheAsshole	I have a pretty decent paying job, he lost his job at McDonald’s back in early May. We have a mortgage to pay, bills, groceries, and all that normal stuff. I’ve also paid his credit card bill, traffic ticket, and put money into his overdrawn checking account. I’ve been the only one financially supporting us since he lost his job and it’s been really really stressful, especially since I detest my job and am miserable at it but I can’t afford to find a new one and take the pay cut right now.Money was becoming increasingly tight as time went on. He applied for unemployment a few weeks ago finally, but still hasn’t gotten any money from them. And he just got a job offer from the one place he applied to and starts in September.The main issue/fight:This guy is addicted to his energy drinks, he’ll have 4-6 per day and buys them two at a time from the gas station. He would just take my card from my wallet and my car without asking and go buy some and/or snacks. It got to the point where that was too much and I asked him (multiple times) to stop. I couldn’t afford it. Couldn’t even afford the gas he was using. I had to start hiding my wallet from him.Now he will be starting a new job soon, he’ll still get the backpay from those few weeks of unemployment whenever it goes through, and I was forced to work a buttload of overtime at my shitty job this past couple weeks and will be getting a pretty hefty paycheck next Friday.I’ve been really extra depressed lately, mostly due to the financial stress and hating my job, so I bought a PC game ($30) on my CREDIT CARD to give me something to keep my mind off things. Then I MENTIONED to him that I wanted to buy a cheap new PC because right now I just have a shitty old laptop. I’ve been setting aside $20-40 per paycheck for a few months to save up to eventually assist him in buying my engagement ring. I have $300 from that already, and I’d need $130 more out of my checking account to purchase all the computer parts. And again, I haven’t bought it yet, I was asking what he thought about it.His response was salty as fuck and he bitched me out for wanting to spend MY money on ME (now that I can finally afford to) but not wanting to give him $15 every single day for energy drinks anymore.. when all he’s been doing is staying at home and sleeping all day. And he said “just don’t expect me to ever spend another cent on you... except for the bills and your engagement ring whenever that happens.” I countered with “don’t even bother” and left for work.AITA?

e9scp3	AmItheAsshole	I picked up my brother and a group of his friends from the airport this past weekend. I went out of my way an hour each way to do so. I was happy to do it but it was still a hassle.I arrived at the crowded airport and went to the terminal. A couple minutes after they said they’d be there. They weren’t there. I waited a few minutes and then called my brother, who didn’t pick up. I called again just as a guy working for the airport waved at me to move on since I wasn’t allowed to park there. I warned my brother I’d have to leave, do a circle, and come back. He said “okay, do a few circles, we’ll be a minute.”I circled several times, which sucked, until they got there and all piled in the car. I saw they had a big bag full of fresh bagels, so the time they were in the airport was them stopping for food. I was excited because I was hungry. They passed them all out and I didn’t get one. I said in sort of a joking way, “you didn’t get me one? Awww” and a girl laughed like that was ridiculous and said “no.”I drove them back and mentioned the whole thing to my parents. My dad was mad at me for even mentioning it and being upset, saying that I didn’t have to get up at 3 am like they did and maybe they were stressed out and had more important things on their mind than getting “spoiled” me a bagel. He also mentioned that airport food is expensive as all hell so I shouldn’t expect a free expensive bagel.AITA for being upset about this? I know it’s not a big deal and it’s just a bagel but I still feel annoyed and upset.

cv4d0z	AmItheAsshole	We've got twins, Sara and Syed.  They're 14 and entering High School this year.  For clothes shopping, I decided I'd just give them some money and let them buy whatever they want with minimal oversight.  I told them both I'd give them $300 now, and another $300 for Winter.  My idea is they're old enough to budget and make these kinds of decisions for themselves.  They can spend the money online, or at the mall, whatever they want.  &amp;#x200B;So they both said they wanted to go to the mall and I went with them.  I wanted to just let them loose, but my 2 14 year olds walking around with $600 didn't sit well with me.  We had a few conversations about the most efficient way to do this.  Figure out what you NEED, and what you WANT.  Find out the stores you want to shop at, get an idea about their prices, then when we get to the mall do a walkthru at all of these stores and find out what kind of deals they have and what items you want.  Then go back, try shit on, and buy what you like.  &amp;#x200B;Syed took my advice well.  He went into a few stores, and found the ones that had the best deals that he wanted.  He bought 3 pairs of pants for $100, 5 shirts for $100, then a pair of Vans on clearance for $30.  He had money left over so he bought a video game.  &amp;#x200B;Sara kinda just casually shopped through the stores and bought what she liked.  All of the prices were reasonable so I didn't say much.  She actually ended up with about 2x the amount of clothes (plus accessories) Syed did.  But Sara started complaining that it wasn't enough money to get everything she needed.  I told her then she can return some stuff and buy what she needed somewhere else?  She said no, what she already bought is stuff she needs so that wouldn't help.  I said oh well, thems the brakes.  You gotta budget better and prioritize.  She'll get more money in a couple of months.  She was unhappy.&amp;#x200B;When we got home Sara cried to my Wife   She complained that its unfair her and Syed get the same amount because girls have more needs when it comes to clothes than boys.  She points out that she had to spend $50 just on underwear, while Syed paid $0.  I actually demanded they both spend $30 to buy socks and underwear that I paid for personally, separate from the $300.  Why does a 14 year old girl need to spend $80 on underwear?  Obviously she already has underwear, and I'm giving her more money in a few months.  I would just buy her more underwear if she really needed it anyway.  &amp;#x200B;Both Wife and Sara insist that Syed can just pretty much wear the same shit every day and no one would care.  But as a girl, she needs at least 2 weeks worth of unique outfits plus matching accessories.  Its not about spending the same amount on both kids, its about spending enough to put them on the same social level.  I'm not sure if thats true.

brqv6u	AmItheAsshole	I just wanted some perspective because some people in my life think I'm being unfair.Leah and I have been best friends since high school. We never dated or hooked up. She has a 12yo daughter Ashley. Leah and her husband got divorced when Ash was 2months old. Leah was actually married to one of our mutual friends. He was a great guy. She cheated on him and Ashley turned out to be the affair partners daughter. So he left her. And she got almost nothing in the divorce. So back then, I let her live in a place I owned. She still lives there. I don't condone the cheating or sympathise with her, but I did what I did for her daughter. My daughter and Ashley go to the same school and they are very close. So, whenever I take my daughter out somewhere, Ash comes too. We have them over at weekends and I'm really fond of her.Now my wife doesn't like the interaction. She thinks Leah is mooching off of us, because I don't charge her any rent. Leah is a waitress and she doesn't make much. She can never afford the place. I own my family business and I can say that we are affluent. I think it's a good gesture. Also, she's my friend. I can do that for her. But recently, at a family dinner, Ashley just told me that she wished I was her dad. This pissed off my wife. And I'm unable to deal with the issues at home. I feel like my marriage is falling apart and I can't afford that. I love my wife. So I stopped visiting her and contacting her. My sister and my mother found out about this and they think I'm being selfish and immature and I have a responsibility towards Ashley. I told them that I no longer intend to contact her and my wife wants them out of the property. They think I'm going overboard and submitting to the wishes of my controlling wife. AITA here?

b2xmyy	AmItheAsshole	My ex was everything I wanted in a partner except for ambitious.  That’s what proved to be our downfall.  He was a “kitchen assistant” at his uncle’s restaurant.  Basically washing dishes, bussing tables, and general cleaning.  I tried talking to him about looking for other work, something he could make a future in, but he was happy there.  So I broke things off.  I thought it best to be straight forward with him about it.  He didn’t yell or cry or anything really until I had finished.  Then he coldly told me that he would eventually take over for his uncle when he retires and had been being trained on how to run the business for years, was that ambitious enough for me?   I tried to say yes!  It was literally all I wanted was to know that he had his sights set higher than washing dishes for the rest of his life, but my ex kicked me out of his apt and wouldn’t have anything to do with me afterwards.

c1wmya	AmItheAsshole	Sorry, English isn’t my first language.I’m gay, my boyfriend is bisexual.I’m admittedly insecure and occasionally have jealousy issues. My boyfriend is insanely attractive and, while I’m not “ugly” by any standards, I’m nothing compared to him.It bothers me that he can virtually have anyone of either gender. I’m afraid that he will leave me for someone else.It’s always bothered me that he is also attracted to girls. I don’t really get it. Why is he attracted to other people (of the other gender) when he is dating me (who is a guy) ?I’ve never really gotten the whole “bisexual” thing. Maybe I’m shallow.We were watching a movie with another friend (his friend, who is a lesbian) when his friend made a remark (to him). She pointed out that one of the girls in the movie was “hot”. My boyfriend kinda shrugged and said that “she’s cute”.I don’t know why, but that really bothered me. I didnt want to make a scene, so I waited until his friend left. We had already talked about him and his attraction to women. I’m not saying that he can’t be attracted to women, just that I personally don’t “get” it, and I don’t want to know about it either.He apologized, said he forgot and that he was just responding to his friend. That’s understandable, but then he said that he “can’t just stop his attraction for women”. Which started a whole argument. I told him that he shouldn’t be attracted to other people when he’s in a relationship, he said otherwise.He said that its okay to find other people attractive, just as long as you don’t act on it. I said that he only thought that because he was bisexual, and that all bisexual people think like that. He said that it wasn’t true, and I told him that he should just pick a side at this point. He is a guy, dating a guy, so he should just he gay. There’s no need to be attracted to women unless he has the intent to cheat on me.I guess that made him upset, because he told me that he wasn’t going to talk about this with me and he left. I really couldn’t tell if he was mad or not but he just left. His sister called me a few hours ago and told me that I was being a jerk. This isn’t the first time this has happened.

I learned so much about cooking from his mom and basically learned all the family recipes and know them by heart. My ex-boyfriends parents came from India, so 90% of the recipes I know are basically Indian recipes that have been in his family for generations.&amp;#x200B;Anyway, when college ended he took a job in California and things just fizzled out between us.

bsj8bm	AmItheAsshole	"About a year ago, I left my wife and needed to move out. We married young and I work retail, so my price range was limited.  Thankfully, two of my acquaintances, one leaving the military and the other dropping out of college were also looking for a new place to live, so we decided to be room mates. We weren't the best of friends, but we had been involved in the same circle of friends for a long time, so we're not strangers either.  We both decided on a set budget of 500 a month from each of us, so we figured we could afford something around 1500 a month.  In our area, that was a pretty hard to find option, especially for something with 3 bedrooms.  Luckily, my grandpa retired and decided to move to Florida and said I could straight up have his house. The only thing I would need to pay was the tax on it and utilities. All in all, it only costs about 480 a month. I told my friends I had found us a place, and the rent would be 500 a month, I figured the extra 20 to adjust for electric or water being maybe used more.  So, the first of the month rolls around, we move in, and they hand me 500 dollars *each.*  So for the last year or so I've just been acting as a landlord in addition to working my normal job. The extra 500 dollars I'm getting a month has changed my life, honestly. I've gotten a new computer, work done on my car that was sorely needed, and have been able to just do things that I haven't ever been able to afford.

b6i3zy	AmItheAsshole	"So, my boyfriend, or ex boyfriend, or whatever he is at this point, met in Spain, when I lived alternatively with my son. I'll just call him bf from now on. It was hot love at first, but at some point we had an on and off relationship, mainly due to the fact that he doesn't like kids, and I had one. He loves to travel so there were many times we didn't see each other, regardless of when we were together romantically or not. In one of our off times he went to Egypt, and was planning to stay away for a long time, to reevaluate his life. In that time, my son got taken off me by the Spanish child protection services. I could only get him back if I had a better living situation. When I told bf, he basically rushed over to support me. After less than 2 months of him being back, he forgot to pull out during my fertile days and I got pregnant.Bf told me to get rid of it, but I really didn't feel good about that. I am basically pro choice but I was torn as for me, personally, it feels wrong. Bf was right about a lot of things, of course, it being maybe the worst time for us to have a baby. At some point he said ""it's your body,"" I think in an attempt to convince me to have an abortion. It did quite the opposite. I thought, yes, it is my body and if having an abortion doesn't feel right for me, then I have the right to keep it. I already had a kid, and I knew that once I had my living situation sorted out, I could definitely take care of this baby. Bf was not happy. We still loved each other a lot but he says he cannot forgive me for the decision I've made. At one point he said he resented me for it. I told him it would've been a small decision on his end, to just have used a condom, or not to have had slept with me at all. It was a big decision on my end. The only thing I think I might've done wrong is not making it more clear beforehand that I would not want to have an abortion. Then maybe he would've been more careful. Fast forward a while and I have my son back, I'm living in the Netherlands with my dad for the moment, and I've given birth to a beautiful daughter. Bf was at the birth and in the first weeks he was doing amazingly. He fell in love with his daughter and even changed her nappy sometimes, something he said he wouldn't do. I had no expectations, because I knew it was my decision and didn't want to force him to be there or anything. So needless to say, I was positively surprised.After a while, he went to England, which he was already planning to do. When he left we were actually still doing well together, and he loves his daughter a lot, despite it being a really big deal for him. But now we're off again and he says he doesn't trust me, he's afraid I'll do something to ruin his life, and he still can't forgive me for keeping the baby. Which leads me to ask the question: Am I the asshole for keeping the baby? If you need any additional information, just ask.

c3ikeg	AmItheAsshole	"Alright, I am sure being spiteful can be considered being an asshole. However let me give you the backstory here as I think it's justified.My sister (30F) is getting married in October. I (21F) am her maid of honor. I'm also a lesbian. I dress a bit more masculine than a lot of girls, but I like to be pretty and dress in cute clothes sometimes too.I had my hair very short for a long time, but I recently grew it out a little below my shoulders. I wasn't planning on cutting my hair, but mt sister made sure to tell me not to cut it short before the wedding. Okay, cool? I wasn't planning on it so its weird she would bring it up out of nowhere.Then we went bridesmaids dress shopping. Again, I was ALREADY planning on wearing a dress. My sister told me I am NOT to wear a tux, that we are all wearing dresses. I never even brought up wanting to wear a tux EVER in my life. I don't like dresses but I do wear them for formal events.And now today: my uncle was talking with me. He was asking how I'm supposed to get ripped if I don't eat meat. I brought up that I'll be seeing him in 4 months again (for the wedding) and I'll show him that you can be muscular and not eat meat. My sister busted in ""No."" What do you mean no?""You're not going to be buff for my wedding.""Okay no one can get incredibly defined and massive in 4 months.. I just want to have muscle.""No.""With all this said and done, I want to cut my hair off. I won't get jacked enough in 4 months to bother her, and I wont wear a tux because we already have the dresses (and again, I don't like tuxs). Reddit, WIBTA if I purposefully cut my hair off before my sister's wedding? (My stepmom overheard me upset speaking with my girlfriend and tried calming me down: ""bridezilla"" is a true occurrence, my sister is a perfectionist, she may just have a specific picture in mind for her wedding.

dhrhuw	AmItheAsshole	Healthy eating is super important to me. I have small children at home, and a large part of my mental space is occupied by thinking about how I can ensure that my family has a generally healthy diet. I'm not completely obsessed. The kids eat cake and ice cream at parties. We take them out to ice cream now and then. I give them a few pieces of chocolate in their lunches. We do a special breakfast once a week where the kids can vote on pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc. But I see healthy eating as one of the most important values that I can instill in my family.The kids usually choose crepes for their special breakfast. These are the richest and least healthy option. I make pancakes and waffles with wheat and oat flour, but crepes I do by our traditional family recipe--butter, sugar, white flour… It's a special treat, and I want them to enjoy it. The only filling we use is pure maple syrup, and the one thing I ask is that we don't use a ton of it. Crepe batter is super rich, maple syrup has lots of sugar, and it is very expensive. I tell them a little goes a long way. Plus, it's healthier to use just a little!We roll our crepes like a burrito, and just like putting ingredients in a burrito, I ask everyone to apply a single line of syrup down the center along the roll rather than pouring haphazardly all over the surface. Not only does it help us use less, but it’s reasonable given the burrito roll method. (When you cut it into small sections, each bite will have the same amount of syrup in the center.) The kids get the rationale, and I make sure that I lead by example.My wife can't get behind the single line of syrup thing though. She likes sweet things and uses lots of syrup on her crepes. She pours in a spiral over the whole surface, using about 3x what anyone else does. For a long time, when she helped the kids fill their crepes, she refused to pour a single line, instead slathering syrup all over. I think it was a sort of protest, as she sees me as being too nitpicky. After a lot of complaining on my part, she did change, but it was a real headache.I want her to jump on board with the syrup thing so that we can send a consistent message to the kids. I have suggested this to her on various occasions and explained my reasoning carefully. I don't think it's unreasonable or irrational to think that we should have a family policy around this, and I have trouble understanding why this should represent a significant problem for her.She thinks I'm being unreasonable and irrational in asking this of her--that it's purely a matter of preference and that I shouldn't be pressuring her in any direction. I want us to be a team on this. This is the only breakfast for which I feel the need to have such family standards--I don't say anything specific about pancakes, waffles, etc. (you need to spread syrup all over the surface of those, although I do still want people to be modest about syrup use).AITA?

My son is playing baseball competitively this year and we spend a lot of time on the weekends training before he starts high school. He’s really into it and I like helping him get better.My stepdaughter will come into the yard while we’re practicing and insist on participating. I asked her once to let us be, and my wife crucified me for it. I also let her participate once but didn’t slow down my throws, hits, and running at all because I’m trying to make my son better, not cater to my stepdaughter. That also upset my wife and she said it was dangerous and rude to my stepdaughter. My wife expects me to either slow down and let her play, or carve out equal time to spend playing catch with my daughter separately. I don’t have the time to do that so I’d have to cut back on training my son, to his detriment.My wife accused me of favoritism and that I’m intentionally excluding my stepdaughter. She claims this is different from the fact that she spends less time with my son than with my stepdaughter because she claims that’s because of age difference, but still expects me to spend equal time with the kids.

cv9lxs	AmItheAsshole	"So let me preface this, I don't agree with what happened as I believe recreational use of marijuana should be legal. I've been living at my current complex for about a year, it's a very small complex where everyone is cramped up together. So smells travel quickly.We have a group down the hall that always constantly stink up the hallways, and subsequently my apartment, with the skunk smell of weed. I've initially left messages asking them to try to filter it better or at least do it somewhere else. We don't have windows we can open, so there's no way them or I can let it out.After still dealing with it for a month, I spoke to management and all they did was say ""no smoking on premises"" in an email.Smells persisted.Now I have family come by alot, and I do my best to give good impressions....but with the constant smell they don't want to visit anymore since they think the complex is full of druggies.So I did the unthinkable, I filed a complaint with police on kids smoking weed. They stopped by, and essentially did a sweep of the complex. Note, this IS NOT what I requested. I just wanted them to tell the kids to do it elsewhere or just stop smoking in the complex.They busted two different tennants, one was in the process of lighting some up and apparently had a personal bag big enough to be considered distributable.The second Tennant was actively dealing from what I overheard, he was busted with a few bricks but did not actively smoke.AITA for essentially ruining these people's lives all because of a bad smell?

d6d42m	AmItheAsshole	Me and Mandy have been best friends since basically kindergarten, and almost since then she's been fascinated with Turkey, Croatia, and the Balkans/Mediterranean region in general. I started dating a guy from a Balkan country and was making plans to go visit him and his family, and while doing so I found this AMAZING package deal that lets you travel the Balkans, Spain, Greece, Turkey and Morocco. Seriously, it was like a once in a lifetime deal and though it's pretty expensive, it's WAY cheaper than it would be to find places to stay and travel to those places on your own.I KNEW Mandy couldn't afford it, and I KNEW it would hurt her deeply that she wasn't getting a chance to go. This trip is literally what she dreams of doing, and with me in particular, but she's been in a lot of financial trouble lately. So I told her I was planning a trip, but not any of the details. I also told another very close friend about the trip, and she looked up the same deal and decided she wanted to go as well. I said I'd love to have the company, so she bought her tickets and she's coming along too. I realized that if Mandy heard about this or found out about this before I got a chance to tell her she'd be super hurt, so I told her about the trip. She was SOOOOOOO upset. She asked about why I didn't invite her, and I told her it was because I knew she couldn't afford it and I thought it would just be salt in the wound. (I also privately think she would have made some very questionable decisions in order to fund the trip, or would have gone and then not had enough for money, or her bills, or things like that at home.) That just made it worse, and she cried, and cried about how we always said we'd go and experience those places together, and that I don't even have any interest in the region, which is pretty much true since I want to travel around Asia. I told her we could still go that in the future, and we could even do this trip in the future, but she was too hurt to want to hear that. My boyfriend thinks I am being kind of a dick, and says for his best friend, he'd have offered to pay for part to help if he could, and I guess I \*could\* but not super comfortably and idk when she'd pay me back.

c17hpk	AmItheAsshole	  My boyfriend Cam and I have been dating since early this year. It’s been great for the most part, but for the past couple of months we’ve been having arguments about his friend Lauren. Lauren and I don’t really get along. She’s like a sister to Cam so I tried to befriend her when we started dating, but she was always aloof to me. She’s very friendly with other people, but whenever I tried to talk to her, she would just answer with a few words then talk to someone else or leave. She would also make me feel out of place whenever we hung out with Cam’s other friends by bringing up things from their college days so everyone would be talking or laughing about something that I don’t know. I told Cam how I felt but he said that I must be misreading the situation because Lauren is not that kind of person. He said that I should give it more time, that maybe Lauren doesn’t know me that well yet that’s why she doesn’t talk to me a lot. But I know that she has befriended people who were introduced to her after I was, like Arlo, Cam’s friend from his new job which he started in March. The three of them play online games for hours while she hasn’t spent 3 minutes talking to me. More than once I asked Cam to talk to Lauren about why she doesn’t like me, but he refused. He said that unless Lauren was ignoring me or talking shit about me, she technically isn’t doing anything wrong by not being besties with me, and it would just make things awkward between the three of us. One time I told him that would talk to Lauren myself, and he said that I was making a mountain out of a molehill.Last Friday was Cam’s birthday so I threw a small dinner party at his favorite restaurant for him and invited our friends, excluding Lauren. I figured that I’m the one throwing the party so I should be able to invite who I want to, and I don’t want to invite and pay for someone who has shown time and time again that she doesn’t like my company and is not interested in being friends with me. Cam was really happy about the surprise at first, but when he learned that Lauren wasn’t going to be there, he pulled me aside and said I was an asshole for leaving Lauren out. He said I should’ve thought about how Lauren would feel if she learns that I invited everyone except her. I was shocked that he would say that when he knew how Lauren has treated me, so I told him that I just gave Lauren a taste of her own medicine and maybe now she’ll know how I feel when she leaves me out of conversations.

ac6erp	AmItheAsshole	"Throwaway account. First Reddit post. Obligitory ""be gentle"" and all that jazz.I have a group of friends that I've been associating with for around 5 years now. We get together on a semi-weekly basis to play tabletop RPGs and, until recently, I had no reason to suspect that I had any problem with the group.There's no question that I'm the political outlier in the group. I'm conservative, while the majority of the group is liberal or centrist (or just apolitical entirely). I never thought anything of it, because I love every single one of them regardless of how much we disagree. I'm always open to discussion, and in fact, I encourage discussion on topics we disagree about, because I like to test the validity of my beliefs. If I can't defend something logically, it's a red flag to me that I need to rethink it.Recently, two of my better friends in the group invited me to dinner to discuss some concerns that they'd been hearing about me. To summarize the conversation, some of the members of the group now think that my beliefs are so much at odds with theirs that conflict is inevitable, and certain assumptions have been made about my character that have absolutely no merit to them.For example, it came up that my limited support for our current president implies that I'm anti-immigration, which is a concern to the young lady whose parents are immigrants. That's just false. I'm currently researching the immigrant link in my own family tree. I've also been told that I'm suspected to be homophobic, and anti-LGBT rights, but I'm pretty openly bisexual, and I've supported advances in gay rights in the past. These are not difficult revelations to stumble across if you just spend a few minutes seriously getting to know me.I'm bewildered by this current situation. I've now found out that they scheduled sessions for a game that we'd prevously played together without telling me. I'm being ostracized because of my politics and by incorrect assumptions that stem from them. And more importantly, the two that finally brought this to my attention should know me better than that, and should have easily dispelled the assumptions as nonsense. Am I the asshole for thinking that this is all childish and petty?TL;DR: I'm a political outcast in my group of friends, and I am now being ostracized because of false assumptions and potential conflict."

db65cq	AmItheAsshole	I recently broke up with my long-term partner, for a variety of reasons that were entirely my fault; he did not want to break up, particularly, but I felt that it was the only way to properly deal with what was going on with me personally.  We are still friendly, to a point, and have had lunch or drinks a couple of times since the breakup, but don’t really see that much of each other. He has a daughter, who is in her early teens and who had gotten fairly attached to me during the time that we were together.  I enjoyed spending time with her as well - she’s a good kid, and we had a friendly relationship, and I suppose I was maybe a confidant of sorts - I’m a fair bit younger than her father, so I think she confided in me when she didn’t feel that she could in him. After we broke up, my ex asked if I would be open to continuing to spend time with his daughter from time to time, as she was apparently upset at the prospect of me not being around anymore. I told him that I wasn’t really comfortable with that, as I thought it would put us all in an awkward position.  He got quite angry, and accused me of punishing her, and him as well, for my own problems, and said that it wasn’t fair to her for me to cut off contact altogether. I see his point, but I feel like it would be a weird dynamic if I were to continue spending time with her, for me, for him, and not least of all for her.  I obviously don’t want to hurt her in any way, but there are other parties at play in this as well. So, am I the asshole for not wanting to maintain a relationship with his daughter, or am I justified in not wanting to do so?

d4seih	AmItheAsshole	My boyfriend and I have been together for 11 years. We are both 29 years old. High school sweethearts.Since I’m anonymous here, that’s the only reason why I am writing real numbers, because I really want to know if I’m being a butthead here.Before, when he was making $60,000 a year he said it definitely wasn’t enough money for him to propose. With student loans, and everything, I understood.Recently he got a huge raise, and his salary went from $60,000 to $91,000. In the past, my family was really sick. Family, as in most people I live with, needed to be taken care of. I don’t live with my boyfriend. I live with my family. I stopped working when things at home got really crazy with the hopes of starting up again. I also have a history of panic disorder getting in the way of me working. As of recent, my family still needs to be taken care of, but I’m in the best mental place I’ve ever been in my life, and I’ve made great strides in my career.This happened around the same time as my boyfriends raise. It seemed like everything was coming together, and me and him could really start our lives together. It seemed great. And, since I constantly speak to him about our future, and how I would want to take care of the both of us, I thought his head was in the same space. But, today he said he wasn’t even thinking of proposing at all, because even with his salary he has a lot to pay for. He lives with his parents and doesn’t pay bills there. The only bills he pays for are for his Jeep, and his student loans. I know those are big expenses, but I don’t think it should stop someone who necessarily wants to propose, and I don’t think they are big enough expenses to stop someone from starting a life with someone else.Am I being the butthead for being upset that he’s not thinking of proposing now, or for being upset at him for not thinking he financially could?

e52boc	AmItheAsshole	I am 38F. I have been married for 2 years to my husband, 57M. We have 1 baby together (2M) and he has 4 kids (11M, 19F, 20M, and 23M) from his previous wife, who passed away 7 years ago shortly after they divorced.To help me out with my baby son, I hired a nanny (55F) who also used to take care of my stepchildren when they were younger. She lives in with us through the week and sometimes the weekend. She is splendid, very nurturing. However sometimes she can be a bit too overly familiar.My youngest stepchild is 11 years old. He is a very smart, well-behaved child who attends boarding school, and has done so for the past 3 years. Sunday (yesterday) was his birthday, and on Friday I asked the nanny if she could drive down to his school and take him home for the weekend. She agreed, and he came home, we threw a party for him.Before he left, I noticed that he had a toy from McDonalds in his book bag. I asked when he went to McDonalds, as there are none near his school. He told me that the nanny took him to McDonalds on Friday after she picked him up, and that she even drove him to her family’s house (about midway between our home and the school) for a quick visit with her family and kids.I asked him why he did not tell me, and he said “I didn’t think I needed to tell you.” I let it go with him but afterwards, spoke privately with the nanny about how it’s inappropriate for her to take my stepson to places without letting me know. Plus, I told her that if he was hungry, they should have just eaten at the school instead of going to somewhere as unhealthy as McDonalds.   I don’t think I was harsh with her at all. It just a gentle reminder more than anything, but then she teared up and said she “feels sorry for him”. I said he’s perfectly happy at school, he’s a very privileged kid and that there’s no reason to feel bad for him. Now there’s a bit of tension between us.

She called me after the most recent incident, I told her I wasn’t in a good place mentally to be her emotional support system. She’s incredibly upset with me and our group of friends think I’m being cruel. Here’s the backstory, she’s been dating her boyfriend for 10+ years. They have 2 kids together. He cheats on her every few months. I can list at least 15 different women/incidents that he has cheated with in just the 4 years I’ve known her. That’s not an exaggeration and those are only the times she has definitive proof of. She won’t leave , she’s never going to leave. I try to be understanding but I’ve also told her I don’t understand why she stays, her response is always a different variation of “Men will be men” and that she loves him. I’ve always been there for her, usually she catches him late at night. Going through his phone while he sleeps. She’ll call me hysterically crying, I’ve always dropped what I’m doing and either talk to her on the phone for hours or go get her and talk in person. This drama typically goes on for 1-2 weeks of me basically being her on-call therapist. I feel as if I put in more effort to help her recover emotionally than he does.I’ve offered every bit of advice and resource I can possibly think of. At this point I’m exhausted. She is a sweet person and a good friend to me and I understand the hurt of being cheated on and I know leaving isn’t easy but I honestly just don’t want to hear about it anymore.

I'll admit that Jordan lacks a lot of experience because he gets anxious about social situations.  He's lost a lot of his friends because he will only be engaged in a convo when he wants to gripe about his work, family life, how girls don't like him, or himself.  I really feel that I'm one of the few friends he has left, as some of our mutual friends told me that they were tired of him being so negative all the time.

I had a pretty emotional break up a couple months ago, and I confided in him about it because he said he felt something felt off with me.  I didn't go into too much detail about it; I just said that I was heartbroken that I liked the guy a lot but it wasn't meant to be.  He left my message on read and never responded.  I came to realize this is what he does often.  It seems that he will blow me off if I confided him in anything that I was going through.  If he does respond, it'll be with empty responses like ""oh"" or ""I'm sorry"".  I guess I always chalked it up to the fact he doesn't have much life experience.&amp;#x200B;I also do cam girl stuff occasionally as a source of side income.  He knows about this because I sometimes will post teaser pics on a gonewild-offshoot sub.   I was upfront about it with him when he asked if it was me.  Now, I really couldn't care less that he's seen me nude, or even if he followed my private blog (he doesn't).  I don't post too often, but he will always text me within *minutes* after I do to compliment the way I look.  Again, the compliment itself doesn't bother me, nor the fact that it's coming from him.

As a result, she held up the security line for a long time. I finally had it and told her she should have been aware of the rules about liquids before getting in line and should have prepared for security screening before getting in line. I suggested that she step aside and let other travelers through and my suggestion was met with a few cheers. She seemed really embarrassed but didn’t apologize at all. After I passed the screen I mentioned to the TSA agent he should manage the queue better. When a traveler was holding up the line he needed to step in, and he failed. He apologized and I moved on.

My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.A lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn’t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn’t unknowingly been hurting my children. And then my girlfriend realizes that I’ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I’ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.I understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first.

Our thought was that we didn't really want anyone there that we didn't know since it's more of a ""close friends and family"" reception. Realistically, the only people who get a +1 are friends because they may not know anyone in my family and I wouldn't want them to feel uncomfortable.   &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;My mom asked about 4 months ago if she could bring her best friend as a +1. I do not like my mom's best friend. She causes drama everywhere she goes, and she especially doesn't like my dad. I said she couldn't. My mom does not have a significant other that she could bring in her place.  &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;My dad has, on his own volition, covered a significant amount of the wedding costs because he is employed well-enough to do so, and my mom has not contributed any money to the cost of the wedding. This is okay with us because we initially weren't going to rely on anyone else for wedding costs. Also, since my mom makes less money than I do, it wasn't a thought in my mind to expect her or ask her to cover the cost of anything in our wedding. The reason I bring this up is because my mom's best friend will somehow twist my dad's generous act of covering the some of the costs into a negative thing. The two of them would sit there and talk negatively about my dad and his fiancee during the reception. Throw in alcohol, and the two of them would draw lots of attention to themselves and put my dad in an embarrassing spot (especially in front of my fiancee's family who has not met anyone in my family yet since they live halfway across the country).

danj6t	AmItheAsshole	"I (M 14) have a thing with my ribs where the bottom part of my right rib cage sticks out from my chest. It doesn't really affect my health, but the doctor said the my bones were hardening because of puberty or something and it would be best to fix it now. After about a year and a half of waiting on the insurance company to help, my mom got the rib brace. I normally wear it when I'm at home because it's this big ring that goes around my torso and it'd be weird to have that on at school. Anyway, my mom got angry at me this afternoon for not wearing it when I go to sleep. I told her that I didn't wear it to bed because it becomes really uncomfortable and sometimes painful after wearing it for a while, and I was constantly losing sleep when I was wearing it. She said something like ""I'm so glad that I wasted $2000 on a rib brace so that you wouldn't use it"", and I got really mad, because I *was* using it and she was trying to force me to wear it to bed knowing that it would hurt and that I would lose sleep. After that, she locked my phone using a parental control app (makes it only able to send messages and call). This is a text conversation we had right after she locked my phone (typed because I cant get on reddit on my phone right now):        Mom: So sad for you    Me: ok    Mom: Hope you have some good books to read    Me: i do :)    Mom: Lots and lots of books    Me: i do :)Mom: Good.

cdf1z4	AmItheAsshole	(OR, refuse to even check out if my kidney is a suit.)So, I am 22(M) and have a nephew 8(M) who is genuinely a good kid and close to me.Around last year, nephew started to have some complications with his health and after having it checked out. Basically in laymen terms, both his kidneys have failed and he is in need of a transplant (Due to some complications dialysis wasn't feasable). Due to this complication both his parents and mine have checked out their suitability and none of them were a match. This has left just me in their close family. But, I want neither to check or donate my organ and I have reasons, let me explain:-I don't want to donate because frankly I am selfish and scared. I had always dreamt of being in army and have been in the defense academy for 3 years with last semester left. And if I donated any organs it will lead me to disqualify based on medical and will seriously hamper my whole life ( I don't have any useful degree that would help me in civilian life).I don't want to get myself checked out for suitability because if I am a match, I know that I won't be able to live with myself knowing that I could have helped out my nephew.

bi4tak	AmItheAsshole	Okay, so at my son's school they have a system where kids get points for good behavior and negative marks for behavior that needs work. There is an app where parents can view this as well as communicate with teachers. My son's grade (1st) was having an end of the year good behavior field trip to a skating rink. The kids that could go had to have so many good behavior points. My son was diagnosed with ADHD and we are working on ways to help him control his energy and to behave better. That said, he was about 5 points shy of being able to go on the field trip. Because of that I did not send in a signed permission slip or money. The day of the field trip comes around and k send my son to school expecting him to have to go to another class room for the day. After school I pick him up and ask how his day was and he proceeds to tell me that they took him with them on the field trip. He said he was told to sit at a table on the side of the skating rink and to do a work packet while watching the other kids. He was upset because he was made to sit and watch everyone else having fun. That is understandable because these kids are 7 years old. Yes he understands consequences for bad behavior but what adult thinks this is a good consequence? So since it was after school, I messaged his teacher asking about it. I have not gotten a reply. I tried calling the principal and was unable to reach her. So I would like to know WIBTA for calling the school board or whoever I need to call and reporting the school? I'm not talking about just reporting because they did a messed up, hurtful punishment but also because I was not made aware my son would be driven from the school for that day.

ady61s	AmItheAsshole	I need some help, Reddit. I’ll try to be as unbiased as possible and present both sides as fairly as I can.Presently, I [M27] am the sole provider for my family’s finances. I work tech support from 7am-4pm on weekdays, and I’m on call with a second job every weekend (Sat 9am-4pm and Sun 9am-9pm). My wife [F28] is a stay-at-home mom for our daughter [7], and she regularly keeps the house tidy, does laundry, often makes dinner, etc. She also hasn’t needed a job since we got married, as my salary has always covered us well enough. We have a modest house, a single used-car payment, and have decent finances compared to other low/middle class families.But lately, our finances have been getting worse than we’d prefer. We have several thousands of dollars in credit card debt (all from necessities, gas, groceries, etc), and only enough savings to last us a month (with roughly the same amount in our checking account). Long story short, we’re spending slightly more than I’m making, and it’s causing some strain.We’ve already made some of the simpler lifestyle adjustments (no unnecessary spending, less fast food, etc), but we’re still hurting financially. My proposed solution to this problem is for my wife to find a part-time job in town to work while our daughter is at school. As an act of fairness, I’d step up and help with housework appropriately. It’s not a perfect situation, and we’d definitely need some adjustment, but adding a part-time salary would relieve our entire financial situation in a few short months, and we’d build savings after that with her added income.The problem with my proposal is that my wife doesn’t want a job.Her proposal instead is for me to find a better/higher paying job. That way, things can stay as they are, but I’d be making more money. Right now, I’ve had the same position at my company for three and a half years, and it’s a great company, but I’ve tried to “climb the ladder” many times over the years with no success. As a response to this, our financial situation, and my wife’s desire, I’ve been considering switching jobs lately. My wife is hoping for me to get a position in management to increase my salary (though I don’t have the skills for management just yet, so that’s not really an option).The issue with her proposal is that I’m already near the salary ceiling for my position/skills. We crunched the numbers, and if I switch companies/jobs, I won’t be making any more money (or much more) at all.  Another consideration is that I’m pretty established in my current company (I was employee 14 in what’s now a growing 75 person startup), and if I move to another company, I’d be starting from square one in terms of tenure/reputation/impact. My wife and I have been having discussions about this on and off for a few months now, and she’s applied for three positions in that time, but because she doesn’t actually want a job, our conversations about it have become unfortunately intense.I want her to get a part-time job to help with the finances, she wants me to get a different/better job to help the finances, and our conversations often devolve into fights where one of us eventually leaves the room. Her resistance to help with the finances is weighing down on me, my pressure for her to work is weighing down on her, and our fights are weighing down on us both. We’re exhausted talking about it, but she’s called me an asshole once or twice in fights about this, so I need to know, AITA for pressuring her to get a part-time job?

cpwu59	AmItheAsshole	"My mum was gone for four days visiting her boyfriend. She comes back, asks me over for dinner, saying she has 4 ears of corn. I tell her I already have plans with my dad, her ex-husband, for dinner. She says ok, she'll make the corn another time then and save it.I say, ""Well, you can still eat the corn"", not wanting on her to not...eat...corn if she really wanted just because I couldn't make it. She says, ""yeah, well, I know,"" in kind of a meek tone, and I go, ""I mean unless you're going to eat 4 ears of corn,"" meaning it to be a light hearted joke. I can see how that could be taken the wrong way if someone was already in a bad mood or just read my tone wrong, but she then goes, ""Yeah, you know, I'll figure it out. I'll talk to you later,"" in a clipped tone and hangs up on me.She's very loving, but up until I was around 17 (I'm 20) we had an estranged relationship as she used to be abusive. She has since gotten the help she needed and has been a kind, generous mother for the past 2\~ years. I think she felt as though I was giving her permission to eat the corn, saying that ""she's an adult that can make her own decisions"". My meaning was just that I didn't want her to not do something on my account.She apologised for it later that night through text and again today, but is still adamant that I was disrespecting her, that she demands respect as my mother, that her her boyfriend shows her how she's supposed to be treated, implied that I'm acting like my father, that I'm being ""manipulative and abusive"" by having ""no problem telling her bad shit about my father but expect her to not call him and tell him to get his shit together"" (that's putting the onus for *her* behavior and emotional maturity on *me,* implying it's *my* fault she can't stop being verbally abusive to my dad - am i wrong?). She said it brought her back to how I treated her when I was 9-12 (so, you know, a literal child), that spending time around my father makes me treat her poorly.I had initially thought she was upset because she felt like I was bailing on her for having dinner with my dad instead, who she hates, but in an argument with her today she said that it was my ""malicious tone of voice"". Now I realise this isn't necessarily neutral of me to say, but I had absolutely 0 ulterior thoughts in my head when I said she could eat the corn -- I feel like it's hard to inject false *""malice""* into a tone of voice. She said, ""It was malicious and you know it."" That got me, and I snapped at her and said, ""Do *not* manipulate me and my words like that""....Am I the asshole? Is this all warranted? I literally just told her she can eat corn without me if she wants because I didn't want her to wait on my account?  I feel like she's projecting a bunch of other shit onto me. I realise I'm not being totally neutral here but I've told her side, if I'm being unreasonable I hope someone will be able to call me on it."

d36k6b	AmItheAsshole	This is from years ago but bad feelings still come up.1. My husband had a psychotic break and was detained under the mental health act. Diagnosed with bipolar. No previous incidents.2. I have a young child from a previous relationship who was at summer camp during the breakdown, so fortunately did not witness anything.Who, if anyone, is TA in the things that happened after?a. My husband's parents were around and even went with him when the police took him to hospital (he had been running round our neighborhood naked and screaming). However they had a holiday booked and went a couple of days later. It was just a local trip to see family. They would have lost a couple of hundred pounds. I think they should have stayed to offer support during that stressful time. AITA?b. Children's services said they needed to do an assessment to see if it would be safe for my young child to live with someone who had had a breakdown and that we could not live under the same roof until after the assessment. Fine. His parents said that me and my child should move out of the house my husband and I rented (we both paid the rent) to live with my parents, who lived 2 hours away. That would mean I would have to quit my job and the little one move school.They did not want him to live with them (they have a spare room) because it would disrupt their routine. They said I was selfish for not 'letting him recover in familiar surroundings'. That's stupid because he would need supervision after coming out of hospital. In the end he went with them. AITA for not moving out?c. He ended up staying for a year at his parents house until children's services was satisfied he was stable on his medication that had been prescribed. From day 1 they charged him the standard amount of rent for renting out a room. He still had all his normal bills and rent coming out of his account (luckily illness insurance was covering that). This was their spare bedroom and I'm sure they are in government subsidised housing already. Basically they made a profit from their son who had just come out of a mental hospital. I pointed this out and they banned me for visiting for 'being rude'. AITA for calling them out?d. Just after being discharged from hospital he had a mental health assessment at (their) home. The dad went out shopping and the mum was 'asleep upstairs after a night shift'. Without being too specific, they both work in hospital settings and know full well that if the assessment had not gone well he could have ended up back in hospital. Even worse he was saying stuff like 'I murdered the president, I murdered my mother' obviously not true, but should not have been left alone with a government person without them to note what he  actually said. I said 'why the hell did you leave him alone with them?' they said 'oh we thought they just wanted to see the house'. I said that's asinine. AITA ?

d0rwl9	AmItheAsshole	My friend and I both have a moderately dark/edgy sense of humor, and often joke around when we're hanging out. We have a handful of youtubers we both like who make similarly edgy jokes as well, and we often reference stuff we found funny from their videos, mostly just because it makes us laugh.My friend shares an apartment with a good friend of his and said friend's girlfriend of several years. I've never gotten into it with either of them before, we're not particularly close but have generally had a decently friendly relationship. The other week we were hanging out at his place, and naturally, some edgy jokes came up, nothing out of the ordinary for us.Generally whenever I'm hanging out at his place, both his roommates are out of the house, so we normally don't have to worry about bothering them, but his friend's GF happened to be in the house for part of the time I was over. We tried to keep things a bit quieter so as not to bother her, but apparently she overheard a few jokes we said from the other room, and got pretty upset, though we didn't find out about this until later.None of the jokes we make are intentionally mean-spirited, everything's all generally good natured. I do understand why she might have felt uncomfortable by some of the jokes, not everyone shares our sense of humor, and tried to apologize for anything that she overheard that might have upset her, but she didn't want to hear it. I'm apparently now barred from going to their apartment ever again, and not welcome at any group activities in that friend group anymore.

When we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. My mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blasé attitude towards belongings and she’s lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn’t attached to material things.I interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl ‘why don’t you ask (my son) since it’s his bike?’ She did and my son said no.

cgi8po	AmItheAsshole	" AltMy daughter (15) lives between me and my ex. I think my ex is a bit too progressive and maybe lax in her parenting, but usually I'm outvoted between her and my daughter. Besides, we think showing one set of rules between both households is better for my daughter. The whole ""united front"" thing, and punishments and values are mostly the same no matter who she's living with. I support my ex in most parenting decisions she makes, and I expect her to support me as much as possible.System's breaking down because she won't.This week I found what only can be described as porn on her phone, and after reviewing the internet history I've discovered plenty on her laptop.

d27ww9	AmItheAsshole	Let me just start off and say I think cheating is deplorable.I have two brothers, John (28) and Matt (25).Around three years ago, our family exploded when it came out that Matt was having an affair with John's fiance. A fiance who was 6 months pregnant. Matt turned out to be the father.John was understandably humiliated and angry. I was fully on his side.  I was disgusted with Matt and the fiance.Here's my issue though. At John's insistence, Matt has pretty much been excommunicated from our family. He isn't allowed at any gatherings where John is. And John purposely makes sure he is at every one. Matt married John's ex-fiance and are raising the 2.5 year old together.To this day, Matt's wife is referred to as a whore and the baby is called a bastard. Only by John but in our family's presence. He hates them with a passion even today.My parents have really struggled with this but have agreed to follow John's rule of no contact with the wife or baby. Even contact with Matt is done in secret.Matt has been kicked out of our family business because John can't be in the same room as him. All photos of Matt have been hidden in the family home. No gifts have been given to Matt's child at all.Am I absolutely crazy to think that three years of this is enough? Matt is clearly remorseful and has apologized many times in tears. He clearly regrets hurting our brother.I can understand that John is absolutely hurt and it must've been the most painful betrayal.But I still love both my brothers. Matt did a shitty thing but how much more does he need to be punished?My poor parents have been broken hearted for the past three years because of this. They have confided in me that they are willing to forgive Matt and move on and regret letting it get this far. We were such a tight knit family before.But I'm really worried that suggesting forgiveness with John will cause a massive fight and he'll make us choose between them.

dgloq7	AmItheAsshole	"So I'm 22M and a single child.I haven't been in the house for a couple of years due to college but do come during whatever free days I manage. Anyway, so Mother(a stay-at-home mum) has always been a stickler for cleanliness and etiquette and I had a bit of a stern upbringing with regards to rules in the house et cetera.  Of course, college changed all that and I've been mostly doing whatever I want, with regards to personal hygiene. That involves taking a bath in the afternoon rather than right after brushing my teeth in the morning (that was the routine growing up).I returned 3 days back and it has been mayhem in the house every morning. We keep on having arguments as to how I'm never listening to her and she refuses to let me have any food unless I take a bath: For breakfast the deadline is 10 am and for lunch it's 2:30 pm. I had been cooperating until yesterday when I lost it and said ""No. I don't care about these stupid rules anymore that you unnecessarily imposed on me for almost 2 decades"" and then she goes ""Well it's MY house and you're gonna do what I say!"".I've been denied breakfast and lunch for two days now because I didn't take a bath until 3 in the afternoon and it's frankly getting on my nerves. I just order Chinese takeaway instead. This makes the issue worse and she goes into maudlin-mode sniffling, ""You'd have cheap-a** takeaway rather than just taking a bath"" Honestly, it does sound frivolous on paper, but it really raises the roof of the house every morning(figuratively).So Reddit, AITA for not taking a bath early in the morning?"

bxl1m5	AmItheAsshole	Hi all. My sister Eleanor and her husband Paul were staying over at our place for my much younger brother's wedding over the weekend.Eleanor and me have daughters who are both 15. My daughter is called Sarah and hers is Becky. They are both very pretty but are polar opposites in terms of personality. Becky is very confident, outgoing, has loads of friends and is a huge party girl. She's also very capable academically and according to Eleanor is top or near the top of most of her classes. Sarah is the opposite. She is a kind and gentle person but is sensitive and at times awkward, with major issues with her confidence. She has a few very close friends rather than being part of a large group. Her academic performance is decent but not exceptional like Becky, but we are nevertheless proud of her because we know she works hard at school. Becky bullies Sarah and has done for a long time. She is spoiled by her parents who think that it's ''just harmless kid stuff''. Just this weekend she told Sarah that she was too ugly to go the wedding and that she would have to stay out of the photos. She also tried to push her out of big family photo at the reception. My wife Diane had to find Sarah after she ran outside crying. This bullying has gone on for years and nobody has made an attempt to stop it. Sunday morning in the garden we heard someone scream inside the house. We ran into the kitchen to find Becky feeling around the kitchens trying to find her glasses. She has very bad eyesight, bad enough that according Eleanor she needs to feel around for her glasses on her bedside table since everything is a blur for her. She has worn glasses in a high prescription since she was a baby. Becky was crying her eyes out until Diane found her glasses in one of the food cupboards. Once she had got them back on she started saying that Sarah took her glasses. I called Sarah downstairs and she admitted that she did take the glasses. We were all disappointed but Eleanor and Paul proceeded to tear into her about how cruel and nasty she was and how frightened and upset Becky was because of her. Sarah tried to explain that Becky had been taunting her about the photos and had been saying that she would be cropped out, but Becky's parents had no sympathy and said that maybe a ''bully'' like Sarah deserves that. I went ballistic and said that Becky had been bullying Sarah for years and they have laughed it off. Paul tried to say that Becky's ''girly teasing'' wasn't bullying and that what Sarah did was. I can see why Eleanor wants Sarah punished, but at the same time her daughter was the instigator and I don't agree with her wanting to punish our daughter after hers inflicted years of psychological abuse on her. We don't want to punishing Sarah. Obviously it was wrong to take the glasses, but it was a response to years of torment.AITA?

While my daughter is married and graduated college, she is not... mentally healthy. That's just the truth.She was a deeply disturbed child. Always unhappy, always on the edge of freaking out. I tried to help, but she never wanted to hear it. She displayed some distressing traits, but not regularly enough to get it reported. She could never focus on anything and still can't. I am shocked that none of the places she's lived in her adult life have ever burned down, because she frequently started fires as a child out of negligence.She has always rushed for substances to cope with anything unpleasant in life. As a teenager, I had a suspicion that she was abusing cough syrup, but was never able to prove it. She has always drank too much. I'm sorry, but when you're regularly drinking entire bottles of wine and daily need a shot of liquor to ""fall asleep"", you have a problem. But she was ""doing well in school"" and then ""had a good job"" so I wasn't able to comment. I know now that she's likely just a functional alcoholic. She's always flirted with Xanax, but was never given a regular prescription.She always wanted children. After getting married, she actually did stop with the drugs and alcohol and got pregnant three years in. She lost the baby fairly late stage (18w). I hate to say it, but that's for the best. She and her equally...not well husband held a funeral for the child, which I of course attended. They were devastated, and for health reasons had a full year wait to try again. The year has passed and they're having the same difficulties and more. Her husband, my son in law, is a frequent flyer in the psych ward for depression issues. She's gone back to previous drinking and now takes Xanax on a daily basis. Her old medical issues that forced her on the pill are back. She is in therapy that clearly doesn't work and is always in hysterics about it. I'm sorry, but objectively, this is for the best. I'd rather go to a funeral a month for the same dead child than subject a living one to a life with these two as parents, with the high chance of inheriting it themselves.She wants to still be called a mother, which people oblige her in. I told her honestly that she needs to get herself and her partner in order before she should even think of getting pregnant and that a woman popping pills every day and washing it down with alcohol is in no way a fit parent.

ah7qv4	AmItheAsshole	"My girlfriend, D, and I have been together for three months. I'm caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I've known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. &amp;#x200B; J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things ""easier"" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date ""all the good Asian girls."" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.&amp;#x200B;I finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a ""what's up"" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). &amp;#x200B;Now, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being ""murdered with sex,"" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said ""Hey"" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.&amp;#x200B;At this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.&amp;#x200B;I walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent ""what's up"" nod and say, ""Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,"" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was."

We have very open relationships, they are good students, have jobs, talk to me if they are going to a party where people are drinking etc and never ever drive under the influence. I have a full time job and sometimes we don’t connect until nighttime. So. I love having them on location services for a couple of reasons. First of all, i don’t want to be a helicopter parent who says “where are you” all the time. A quick check lets me know my son is at work or my daughter is at a friend’s house and then I don’t bother them. No calls or texts, all is well. I also think about how fast we move around and if something bad happened I’d be able to find them ASAP. One of my kids was in a car accident and I was able to get there immediately without having to ask for directions. Another kid went off to college and it gives me so much pleasure to see him in another city without getting in his face and asking what he’s doing. It makes me feel connected without bothering him. That said, a lot of people are saying this is a huge invasion of privacy for a young adult.

She told me that she wanted choco chip. I drove for an hour to find a place at that time. But they didn't have any choco chip at that time. I didn't want to disappoint her, so I got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. When I got back, I told her that I didn't find choco chip. Idk what happened but she started crying and yelling  at me. She threw away the ice cream, called me a fucking imbecile and told me I didn't love her. She also told me that she didn't want to sleep next to me. I slept in another room. Now today, she comes to me, cries, apologizes and tells me that she was really stressed out. But I did not sleep with her at night. I've decided that I don't want to do anything now. This is not the first time this has happened. I'm not a fantastic cook. She insists that I make something for her, but when I make it she always tells me that it's horrible. She later apologizes and tells me that it was wonderful ( all this started after the pregnancy ).

aqlo6a	AmItheAsshole	I apologize if this is incoherent, I’m still pretty upset. So some context. I [21F] had been dating a guy [20M] for almost a year. He was very sweet, and I liked spending time with him. He lived an hour and a half a way and would drive up all the time and stay at my house. My pet had a vet appointment near him (long story but no exotic vet in my area) and he came up for a day, we drove down the next, and drove back the day after so my pet could heal from surgery. My nana died the day we drove down and I wasn’t in the best mood. The day after this was my birthday. So at this point we had spent the last four days together. For my birthday we got lunch and went to dinner with my family. Then i wanted to go to a bar with my best friend. He got very upset that I didn’t want to spend my birthday with him (even though I did, and several days prior) and stormed out of my house. I angrily texted him at like 3am a little drunk that I was mad at him for making my birthday about him. He ignored me for four days until he called me last night and broke up with me (the day before Valentine’s day.) I understand that he drove a lot for me, and I thanked him a ton and offered gas money, but I feel like this is a weird thing to be dumped over? Am I the Asshole? should i have just not celebrated my birthday with my friend?

d95cgz	AmItheAsshole	" Me \[33F\] and my bf \[32M\] have been together 2 years. When we met he was living with his parents\*, and I was new to the area with a 1-bed apartment. I work an office job, regular 9-6 + occasional weekends for deadlines. He’s a freelance arts teacher, part-time hours, and they can be at a different school every day. His salary's not 100% stable, but on average I make about 3x his wage. The rent on my place eats about a third of my salary.He's such a sweet, creative guy and I fell for him from the first date - we're inseparable and he's been staying at my place 5 nights a week basically from the day we hooked up. 2 mornings a week he teaches at schools near his parents' place, and so those days he sleeps back with his folks otherwise he'd have to get up like an hour earlier if he stayed over with me. It sucks 'cos I want to go to sleep next to him every night, but nobody wants to get up at 5am, so I don't feel emotionally abandoned or anything by this.But: in these 2 years he hasn't contributed a cent of rent. He contributes ""in kind"" a bit - cooks maybe a couple of meals a week (I can't cook, we dine out for the rest), does the washing up (though not very well, grr). Meanwhile, he pays rent to his parents for those 2 nights a week, whereas he's in my apartment 5 nights a week. So, the other day we had That Conversation: I said that I want us to live together officially, I want us to be a household, and that means him making reliable contributions. I don't need his money to make rent, but, I guess... I want his commitment, his investment? Idk if that makes sense. If we split the rent 50/50 that would be 1/2 of his salary going to rent, 1/6th of my salary going to rent.I thought this was entirely reasonable - romantic, even, we were finally going to have Our Home, not just My Home!Well. Nope. I got a lot of pushback. ""I'm so poor compared to you, it's not fair that you're asking for 50/50 when you make so much and I make so little""; ""I'd still have to send money to my parents\*, they're my parents, I can't just cut their income stream without warning""; ""If I have to pay rent I'll have no savings or security!""; ""If I do this, you'll pay for us whenever we go out to eat right? I won't be able to afford to go to restaurants or movies with you otherwise""; ""You'd be lonely if I didn't come over, I’m doing you a favor""I was astonished. I was crying by the end of the conversation. I don't feel like I'm asking for something unreasonable. I'm not asking him to start contributing to my saving-to-buy-a-house fund that I hope he'll live in with me one day, I'm just asking for an equal split of the month-by-month, fundamental price of keeping a roof over both our heads.

cz4z9j	AmItheAsshole	My dad has two small companies, one is selling/laying tiles and the other one is room rental.I started working in the first one about a year ago when I got out of school. He had a woman doing all the management for the second one but after a huge argument she left and I had to replace her (FYI, I don't have any training in that field at all). So for the past 6 months I am in charge of everything. Sales, marketing, customer service and managing the rooms. I'm his only office worker (he is responsible for the construction sites) and having to manage two companies at a time has been very stressful in the last few months. As you can imagine, when you have so many things to keep an eye on you tend to make some mistakes. And when I make them, even if they're little, I get absolutely destroyed with words. I'm not saying he's an asshole for yelling at me because let's face it, almost every boss is strict, that's how the world works and I'm not expecting to have a nice and understanding boss in my next job. Still, being called an idiot is not fun, especially when you're doing your best to keep your fathers company afloat.Now here's the thing, as a father he is actually great, he was always there for me, even after losing custody over 10 years ago when my parents divorced. You could say maybe he is doing all the yelling and inducing stress to help me become a man, and I respect that. But I can only endure it this much, I'm fresh out of school after all.He never tells me this personally but what I've heard is that he always talks about how he couldn't keep going without me, that he had to close the company if I were to quit suddenly. That's why I've already told him that I will probably quit soon and that he should start looking for someone to replace me, but so far he has not made an effort to look for new employees.I can't keep up this level of stress much longer, It's making me physically and emotionally weak. Selling tiles is something I could imagine doing, but I absolutely hate the other job.

He has some issues with the dancing but is mainly okay with it and tends to be there when I perform anyways. Saturday while my boyfriend was there he did something humiliating that almost could have cost me my job. Part of my job is engaging with the audience and hyping them up. That Saturday night a guy who is a regular at the club and I got to talk in between my performances. Nothing sexual because I was doing my job. I was at the bar section after my performance and was about to ""order"" a drink which I get for free anyway. The guy offered to buy me one and I accepted it because the money would go towards the club anyway.My boyfriend however was not happy with this and he made a big deal out if it in front of everyone because he was very drunk on top of that. It was embarrassing and humiliating and after I couldn't even do my last performance because of how upset I was. The bouncers almost kicked him out but I talked to him instead.

c2cmv9	AmItheAsshole	To start this off, I love my sister. I support her 100%. When she told me she is trans I got behind it immediately. I referred to her with the correct pronouns privately and used her chosen name for a full year before she came out. I fought for her when members of our family rejected her and I would and have immediately cut anyone off if they are in any way hateful towards her. When she came out she was embraced by many but rejected were loudly by enough people for it to be absolutely devastating. As a result we became very close and spend much more time together than we did before. Now, for the shitty part. Ever since she came out she’s been getting progressively more annoying. She FAKES stupidity, like will actually put on a 2000’s style Paris Hilton ditzy act. She’s taken up cattiness that she never ever had in her before and just recently I caught her pretending not to know how to put windshield wiper fluid in her car. Like, she actually created this whole scene where she was confused and needed help doing a task I know she can do because she taught me to do it when I got my license!A cousin eventually said something to her which resulted in a lot of tears and her calling that cousin transphobic (i know he’s not but he did come on really strong telling her that she was being fucking annoying) so I know that I have to tread very carefully.Now I’m wondering if this is just kind of like her going through the same self discovery I went through as a teenager and it will pass?

czaetj	AmItheAsshole	So I recently saw a post that described an issue similar to the one my girlfriend and I are having right now, so I figured I'd share.For context, I'm a guy who tries my best to keep it pretty clean. Thankfully I'm not naturally very hairy, and regularly shave my arms, legs, chest, and armpits (partly due to personal preference, and partly the result of habits I developed when I swam in college).I also just cannot stand body hair on women. Sorry if that statement makes me an asshole, but I just can't get over it. Yes I understand women can do what they want with their bodies, and I respect their decision if they choose not to shave. But no amount of posturing is going to sway me on this one (and I think most guys would admit to feeling the same if you put a gun to their head). So I feel that if I keep myself clean shaven, I'd have more of a leg to stand on if I were to ask a woman to do the same. Anywho my girlfriend and I have recently arrived at that stage where we are living together and are comfortable being disgusting around each other (shitting while the other's brushing their teeth, etc.). She's also stopped shaving her armpits as frequently, which has really gotten on my nerves. I politely told her that this is an issue for me, and asked if she would shave more often. She replied by saying that it's 2019, and that women shouldn't be stigmatized for having body hair. Yea I suppose she's right, but it still bothers me, so I am refusing to shave my ass/around my asshole until she relents, which has in turn really gotten on her nerves. She thinks I'm an asshole, but I'm merely trying to get her to see things from my perspective.

dh582h	AmItheAsshole	"So I've (29F) lived in this apartment for the best part of a decade now. I don't own it but I've been saving up because I'm on good terms with my landlord who has agreed to sell it to me for a good price in the next few years since he's starting to get a little bit too old to deal with upkeep.During this time I've had roommates rotating in and out to help afford rent. The latest roommates are a couple, Dan (24M) and Jess (25F).A few months ago they announced that Jess was pregnant and due in a couple of months!!! I was really surprised because, I feel mean saying this, she wasn't showing very visibly through her body shape. I congratulated them but when I asked what their plans were for their future family home they said they were hoping that I would move out. I said that goes against my plans that I've had for years and that I was planning on staying here. They insisted that I would ""have"" to move out as they're a new family now and need space. I told them that was great and I respect that need but if they wanted space they would need to find a new place as I was here first.Shit got pretty cold from there. We haven't really talked much, until now. They had the baby and it's now about a month old. I knew I'd have to bunker down a bit so I took all of my things from the common area (TV, consoles, kitchenware, etc) and with some work I got a pretty nice compact setup in my room with some DIY soundproofing and a makeshift kitchenette so I can ignore the baby's crying. They used my stuff previously and were not happy at all and had to beg on facebook until someone got them new dishes, making sure to shit talk me in all the posts which I thought was pretty rude but whatever.Because I found out so late about the pregnancy, we're still on the lease for a good 6 months. They want me to break the lease so they can focus on their family. I told them that as I said before this wasn't going to happen. Either they break the lease or they put up with me living my life the way I want to, which includes having people over, listening to music, smoking weed (legal state), drinking, etc. They said they can't afford to break the lease. I said that's unfortunate but neither can I. They said it would be easier for me because I'm not a parent and that I would just need to scrimp a little bit so I can afford to pay two rents. I said maybe but I'm not going to hamstring my lifestyle because they chose to inconvenience everyone around them with their kid. I was admittedly kind of the AH for saying this but I was being harassed.So my living situation has been kind of a cold war ever since. It's really miserable for everyone right now and while I don't expect them to drop out of the lease I'm kind of hoping they do because them and their banshee kid are really giving me a headache. But I've invested too much into getting this place to leave so even if they stick it out I plan on signing the lease again and maybe seeing if the landlord will be able to not renew them."

b7oc7h	AmItheAsshole	Hello,This is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/This last month has been kind of wild for me so I haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. This spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. At the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact.

He basically said he had a great time talking to me, and was hoping that we could meet up some time to talk again in the future. This made me really uncomfortable because I never gave him my phone number. He must have gotten it from my profile with the dealership.

Chloe's bio mom is in and out of the picture, but has only seen her a handful of times this year, and last year was the same. Chloe's mom is now with another man and has two other children (aged 1 and 2). She does not pay child support.Since we've been engaged, I've been nudging my fiance to get a paternity test for Chloe. He and Chloe's mom broke up because she was cheating on him, and he acknowledges there's a possibility Chloe isn't biologically his. I just want proof she's his before we get married. I'm not sure what I would do if she wasn't his, but I feel like I should be allowed to know the full situation since I'm paying for half her upbringing.AITA?

cu2eyk	AmItheAsshole	"I met my boyfriend (2+ years) through his best friend, \*Andy, who was also a close friend of mine.  Andy is dating \*Becky.  Once when I was with my boyfriend, Andy called and I -- completely unintentionally -- overheard Andy say that he had cheated on Becky with his ex.  My boyfriend and I exchanged a glance about this.  Andy talks about his ex a lot and admits he has feelings for her.  I've been cheated on several times, and hearing that a close friend did this to someone I knew and liked admittedly upset and disappointed me.Becky is much younger than Andy and I.  In addition to the cheating, I feel that Andy is kind of a dick to her: for example, after just a couple of weeks of dating and her spending several nights, he started demanding that she pay rent and split groceries that he would buy.  She capitulated, even though Becky still has her own place, and they still do their grocery shopping separately, etc.  So, sometime in February, Becky and I start chatting on Facebook and I end the conversation with a lot of supportive generalities: ""You are so smart and beautiful.  Andy can be a dick sometimes.  You shouldn't feel insecure or think that anyone has the right to push you around.""  That kind of thing.  She thanks me effusively for being so encouraging and nice, and that's it. Months pass, and I learn that Becky has accused Andy of cheating on her, alleging that she found out because I had drunk dialed her in the beginning of May.  My boyfriend and Andy are furious at me.  However, Becky's story is conclusively not true: 1- I was out of the country, backpacking with my parents, both teetotalers, at the alleged time of the call, so I was definitely not out drinking or making weird international calls; 2- I have never had Becky's phone number; and 3- My boyfriend, at my insistence, looked at my phone records on the Verizon site during this time and was able to see that I didn't call Becky (he knows her number).   I honestly wish I'd told her about the cheating, but it seems like she's been suspicious of Andy and used me as the fall person. Andy has blocked me completely, he's poisoning our friend group, and my boyfriend -- who now believes my version of events -- refuses to give Andy my side.  He says he won't ""choose between his best friend and his girlfriend.""  I'm not asking him to choose.  I am asking him to tell Andy the truth.  AITA?"

I told her what I thought and it turned into a (drunken) argument. Since I've been sober I still feel the same. The gift was a menu from The Coon Chicken Inn. It shows a monkey showing his teeth with the name of the restaurant on it. If you dont know, the Coon Chicken Inn was a restaurant in the 1920s that lasted to about the 1950s. The owner was, obviously, a white man, named Maxon Lester Graham. Now, I am a white woman, my friend is a white woman, and my other half is a white man. I, personally, find a lot of things that are, at least, virally viewed as racist, silly. Things like white people having dreadlocks. This, however is one thing I cannot get behind.

He recently asked me if it would be okay if he took the kids to New York for a few weeks. I am completely happy for them to go, but my daughter is OBSESSED with New York and she really wants to go. Since she found out her big brothers are going, she’s super excited. I am considering asking their dad if he would take her along too, because the boys would look after their little sister. The only thing is I wouldn’t be able to afford it so I’d have to ask him to do it out of goodwill. He is always treating the boys to expensive things and my daughter is always left out- it would be nice if he ever included her in stuff but she doesn’t even see a Christmas card from him.

aex00x	AmItheAsshole	My girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year and living together for about two months. Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. We can’t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we’re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we’re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she’ll get up while I’m sleeping etc etc. I know she can’t help it, and she’s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it’s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. I always have to pause a movie we’re watching or something she’ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don’t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. Am I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this?

bq5k6s	AmItheAsshole	Apologies in advance if this thread is a bit of a downer. This is a question I've been struggling with since I found out the extent of my condition, and it's honestly only gotten more stressful as time has gone on. By the way, please don't let my condition influence your judgement of me, I'm only including it here for context.I'm a 29 years old woman and was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. So let me take this opportunity to remind everyone to get a mole map done at some point, it most likely would have saved my life. Anyway my condition has only gotten worse and my chances of survival are 10% at best according to those treating me. I've basically been told that I should prepare everything now for when I (most likely) pass away.This leads me to a difficult situation regarding my sister. We've never really gotten along well, mostly living separate lives, and we completely stopped talking to each other several years ago. My sister was responsible for breaking up my first marriage after she told his parents something about me that they didn't approve of. His parents threatened to excommunicate him if he didn't divorce me, and he did. I haven't spoken to her since.I've never forgiven her for this. And I never will forgive her. Ever.However, my mother, father, and brother - while understanding my resentment - all want me to forgive my sister. They say that what she did was despicable and I'm completely right to despise her, but that if I don't forgive her before I pass she'll never get closure. Supposedly (all of this I've heard through my parents), she has been racked with guilt ever since she found out about my condition. She wants to apologise and seek forgiveness but I haven't given her the chance.As I said, I cannot and will never forgive her. This post is not about whether I should forgive her.This post is whether I should pretend to forgive her so that she can have closure. This is what my mother wants me to do. As it stands now, I have no intention of giving her closure and feel she doesn't deserve it. My family thinks I'm being vindictive (they haven't said this harshly due to my situation, but they really want me to forgive her).Everyone in my family is extremely attached to this situation and I need some unbiased opinions here.

czzshy	AmItheAsshole	"I (f) own a piercing and tattoo studio and take pride in doing things properly. For those of you who don't know, piercing guns are generally very very bad. Although most people say ""I had mine done with a gun and they are fine"", it's still a poor way of piercing as a gun forces the jewellery through the lobe causing trauma to the skin, meaning that, if you decide not to have the piercing anymore, the holes are less likely to heal and the scars will be more thick and visible. Also, you cannot properly sterilise a piercing gun, and they break/get stuck often. It's also easier to pierce with needles as you can be 100% sure of where the hole is going to go. Because of this, I always pierce with needles and make sure my staff do too. My sister is 18 and has a 5 month old baby girl. I love my sister and my niece to death but my sister was insisting on piercing her daughter's ears, and assumed I would do it. In my studio, we don't pierce babies because of the chances of the piercings being uneven when they grow up, and simply because as the owner I don't think it's fair to pierce someone who cannot give their consent to the procedure. There's also the added issues of babies not knowing it's bad to play with new piercings, the risk of them falling asleep on the piercing and hurting it, and I've also heard of parents not cleaning the piercings properly because they're ""worried about hurting the baby"". I told my sister, when she asked when she could bring my niece in, that I would not do it. She said that if I don't, she'll go to Claire's and get them done there. I thought she was just trying to goad me into doing it to be honest, so I rolled my eyes and that was it (we've had chats before about why piercing at Claire's is bad). The next day she messaged saying she was in the mall and she was serious, and I have ten minutes to say I'll do it.I ignored her, so she called me, we had a small fight in which she insisted I do it, or Claire's does, so I eventually agreed. She brought my niece into my studio, and I pierced her ears. It was actually quite a smooth process but my niece obviously cried. My sister actually paid me, which surprised me, and then she left, happy she got what she wanted. I feel awful, and unprofessional. This was a couple of weeks ago and the piercings are healing well.

d3cizk	AmItheAsshole	"My mom and I are planning on living together. Here is some backstory.  I am 19 years old. We're having to move out because my step dad recently passed away from cancer. And this is his house, and how he left the will we won't be able to live here anyways. So we need an apartment. She wants me to put bills in my name (ex. Lease, Utilities) My moms credit is fucked up because she took all of the bills from my dad when they divorced to ""keep the peace"" while also taking the minimum amount of child support possible. My mom has alienated me from my dad, and made him sound like the bad guy a lot through my life. She even has to mention every time about my $8,000 hospital bill from when she put me in the mental institution. (Lots of childhood trauma I went through)  I just start training on my job this Monday and I need money to pay for a TB test and a money order for the application. I gave my mom all of my money ($70, I do landscaping to get money for now) for the cable bill that was overdue, and it was shut off. I also gave some money for the electric bill. And trying to give her to spare me $40 for all of this was like pulling teeth. She's borrowed money from her boss, coworkers, friends, family and it's easily like $800+ right there. She doesn't have to worry about the mortgage. Only cable, electric and a car payment. So I expected her to be able to help me out for this job I need if I want to support us. I've given my mom over $2000 easily from a college grant last year (I'll talk about that later. I couldn't go to college for a lot of reasons that were out of my reach) When she handed it to me, she asked me to run to the store and get her cigarettes, and drinks and toilet paper. So I told her no. She tried to take it back but I demanded that I need it for my job. She then threatened and said for me to live with my dad. She did this before to hurt me because I used to not talk to him. (again, alienation so I thought he was the bad guy)  If I live with my dad I have a promised place to live, and not worry about bills being in my name, and overall my credit can start to be built. My dad just wants me to pay off the other half of the car he gave me, my insurance, and some money for bills so we both can live comfortably.

dc2rg6	AmItheAsshole	Got married last weekend and had a lovely day, but had some commotion early on the wedding day. For flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces, Amber and Katie. They're both eight and it was a tough decision. Unfortunately for my perfect day I felt shallow and since Amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) I picked her. Her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did. During the wedding prep Katie and her dad (my brother) kept telling me that Amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the job. The girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know. I didn't pay too much mind to it since I was too caught up in myself.On the wedding morning I got to witness the bullying myself and it was pretty cruel. Amber (and keep in mind this is an eight year old child) told Katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly. I could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and I made Amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to Katie. Amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past days I haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother. My husband and I are going away on our honeymoon on thursday, and i was anxious to get in touch with my brother before we leave. He finally called me and was extremely angry at me for taking the job away from his daughter. He said Amber has been crying the past two days and felt really humiliated, and was really looking forward to the job. As someone who was bullied myself growing up, it felt like the right thing to do after Amber's behaviour towards Katie. I can't imagine how upsetting those comments would be, and at that point Katie, who had never been anything other than well behaved deserved it more than Amber.

All this time I thought it was fine. Well the latest is everyone setting up weekends they'll host some kind of Game of Thrones watch party. A bunch of us were at dinner figuring out who would take which weekend. I spoke up to say that we would happily put in money for anyone's weekend to cover cost of drinks or snacks.The next day I got a message from one of the other women in the group asking me why we didn't host one. I said that I don't even watch the show, so it would be weird, and that everyone else seemed to have it covered. She asked me why I don't watch the show and kept saying ""You are the ONLY human being alive not into GOT. I promise.""She said she's always thought it was weird that I didn't join in that stuff.

She doesn't like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it's prolonged his crush because she hasn't been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. &amp;#x200B; J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things ""easier"" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn't told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date ""all the good Asian girls."" I can't decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it's hard because you can't really choose who you're attracted to.&amp;#x200B;I finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn't acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I'm trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a ""what's up"" nod. Okay, fine. He's about her height when she has heels on - it's obvious this guy really is not her type so I'm not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she'll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). &amp;#x200B;Now, I don't think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D's roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she's being ""murdered with sex,"" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D's and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people's music or tv most of the time. She said ""Hey"" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won't go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.&amp;#x200B;At this point we're both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that's something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I'm being mean. I tell her I'm sorry, she's right, and leave to go to the shared men's room down the hall.&amp;#x200B;I walk past the common area and see J. He's just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent ""what's up"" nod and say, ""Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,"" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here's where I wonder if I'm the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there's some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was."

c154m5	AmItheAsshole	My daughter is 16 and ever since she was younger I would always give her responsabilities around the house, one of them being washing her own underwear. About two months ago while going into her room I noticed a pile of underwear near her bed, all of them were dirty. I washed them and when she got home I asked her about it and she told me she was too busy at school and had forgotten but it wouldn't happen again. Then, two weeks later I went to her room again and found yet another pile that was poorly hidden under the desk. This time I didn't wash them and when she got back home I asked her once again the reason and she said she had forgotten. I made her wash them and she seemed like she had learned the lesson. After that I keep an eye on her and sure enough, a week later I found another pile. This time I told her that if I found any more of it I would throw them in the trash and she apologized. When I did find yet another pile a few weeks later I threw it in the trash and did the same thing last week to another one. Yesterday, she finally realized that most of her underwear was gone and she threw a fit. I told her that if she wanted she could buy new underwear out of her allowance but I wouldn't spend money on it. She decided to take the issue to my husband who was aware of the problem but not the fact that I was throwing them in the trash. He told her that he wouldn't get in the middle of it and said the same thing to me but added that if I wanted his help then I should have kept him in the loop.

bqrzmu	AmItheAsshole	"So I feel pretty crummy even typing this out to complete strangers but here goes. My husband and I have been married for 4 years and we have a 1.5 year old together. He works and I agreed to stay at home since the birth of our son. I was earning only about 1/8 of what he was anyways, so we decided the most sensible arrangement since getting married was that I'd become a homemaker and SAHM when we had a baby. &amp;#x200B;I've been a stay at home spouse/mom for about 3 years now and it was fine before the baby. But now there are a lot of things I want to change but don't know how to, especially when it comes to finances which I feel like I have no power over. My husband earns good money but he's very frugal about nonessential spending because he wants to be financially independent (no job, earnings from investments) at an early age. Granted he was like this when I met him but I had also had my own salary at the time to do what I wanted. I'm looser with my money because I like eating out, going out with friends, going shopping, etc. All the normal things people in their 20s buy and do. &amp;#x200B;Well now that I stay at home we have mini fights every time I want to buy anything over $150 (which is the limit he set that needs a ""conversation""). This means if I go out to get clothing, makeup, brunch, little treats, etc. and the amount exceeds $150, I would need to call him beforehand and talk about what I'm buying. It feels extremely restrictive and quite frankly humiliating. He spends so little on himself that it seems like to him that I'm the one spending all the money on myself every month. &amp;#x200B;I've been talking to my sister who's also a SAHM and she says her and her husband have an agreement where she's ""paid"" for childcare/homekeeping. Essentially she gets ""paid"" a few thousand every month to spend on whatever she wants because in their relationship he's also the stingy/frugal one and she wants to have more pocket money for fun things. Right now she says she gets about $3,500 a month because that's how much it would cost them to hire an outside nanny where they live. It's a bit cheaper where we live so I wouldn't be asking as much, but would I be the asshole to suggest a similar arrangement with my husband so I don't need to go groveling for money every time I want to buy myself something nonessential?"

cecpqk	AmItheAsshole	My brother has always had a beer stein that he was given a long time ago. This particular beer stein was taken as evidence during the Munich beer hall putsch and found its way into my brother's possession close to a century later. Needless to say I have always been disturbed by my brother's possession of what is nothing short of Nazi memorabilia.As my kids have been staying at his house recently I told him to get rid of it since I don't want my kids around Nazi items. My brother has refused and tried to excuse his behaviour by saying it's not a big deal. I whole heartedly reject this as the beer stein is a symbol of Nazism.I was house sitting for him this week and took the opportunity to get rid of the beer stein. Since then I've been villanised by our siblings and parents who refused to acknowledge how inappropriate it was to have such an item.

bzr0h7	AmItheAsshole	"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. We have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. I wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but I do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when I can. BF doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. For reference, I am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. He is a 5'7 170lb guy. On Sunday I went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. If you're familiar, it's 13er James Peak in CO. It was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). I had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. Suffice to say, I was pretty hungry by dinner time. I made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. When it came time to eat, because of my big day, I grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. We're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. BF got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. He told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. I told him that I'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. He told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. I said that I agreed, but again, I'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. He told me I should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. We've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). So far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. I think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general. AITA? Is this just really dumb?"

It's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. We decided we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. Our plan is to have our ceremony on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast, bloody Marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this, who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). After that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day.

About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. Now, I'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. Now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures).

ce9koh	AmItheAsshole	Ok I know I’m probably TA, but honestly I feel like I’m justified. I’ve just returned to work since having my Bub. I’m a coeliac and obviously can only eat gluten free. I make a special lunch everyday for work. 4 days in a row my first week back at work and my food was ‘going missing’ when I’d go to get it from the fridge. I sent out an email to all staff in the office about it. The next day the same thing again so I went to my boss. He sent out an email reminding people to only eat their food. The next day it happened again. FYI I have my name on it. I asked my boss if we could put cameras in the lunch room, he said no. I asked if he would comp my lunch expenses as I had to buy from the local cafe and shits expensive yo! He again said no. I sent out another email and spoke to as many people as I could (about 15 out of the 20 in my office). The next day I was feeling more positive. I left a note on my food again stating it was mine and to not touch it. Lunch time comes around again and my food is gone. I was pissed so I threw out everything that was in the fridge. No one technically knows it was me, as I haven’t admitted to doing it, just like the jerk off stealing my lunches hasn’t come forward. The boss sent out another email threatening written notice for anyone who touches anyone else’s food. My lunch hasn’t been touched since.

byrxkv	AmItheAsshole	I (40s/M) have one son (14/M) and a step daughter (6/F). My son is playing baseball competitively this year and we spend a lot of time on the weekends training before he starts high school. He’s really into it and I like helping him get better.My stepdaughter will come into the yard while we’re practicing and insist on participating. I asked her once to let us be, and my wife crucified me for it. I also let her participate once but didn’t slow down my throws, hits, and running at all because I’m trying to make my son better, not cater to my stepdaughter.

blich3	AmItheAsshole	So years and years of backstory here. Ex wife has BPD and life with her has been a continuous struggle. We are in the middle of a divorce because while she’s lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. For financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and “yeah yeahed” me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. Then getting mad at me when I said I had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. I’ve had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. On a lark I called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in NM. He said I’m hired. I talked to my partner and he’d gladly buy my half of the business.

cj19fa	AmItheAsshole	Hi, all! I’m (26F) struggling with a gym issue. I joined a gym 2 months ago and after a gym staff member became friendly with me. He has been inviting me to come to the gym near closing so we can work out together after closing to be workout buddies. I declined because I don’t want to work out alone at night with someone I don’t know and I like to workout alone. Each time, I’ve been more and more uncomfortable because he watches me workout until it looks like I’m free to talk. I politely asked him to leave me alone during workouts so he started stopping me at the door on my way out.  2 days ago, he asked me if I would be interested in joining him for lunch so we could get to know each other better. I told him I’m married but could get lunch as a friend. His face turned red and he accused me of lying because I wasn’t wearing a ring. I explained to him that my husband and I don’t wear one because we think the money is spent better elsewhere and I never mentioned I am married because it was never relevant to the conversation. He started to go on this rant about how he just knew I was the perfect woman for him and if I gave him a chance I’d also realize that. I repeated that I am happily married to X (his name is clearly Asian). He claimed as a white man he could make me happier than my Asian husband.That’s when I lost it. I am Asian and received plenty of “me love you long time” shit from all types of men all my life. Not only that, I am angry this man insulted my husband and our race. I called him a racist creep and I’d never even consider dating someone like him and I was sure his d*ck must be withered from all the steroids he’s been on to build his swollen body puffs. He walked away after that, and some other members told me I’d crossed a line. Only one person told me he could understand my anger. I’ve also been banned from the gym for being inappropriate and body-shaming (which also makes me think I may have taken it too far by what I said and I am horrified I have body-shamed someone).My husband is fully supportive of me putting in a complaint. A friend of ours told me it was harmless and the guy probably just thought I was attractive but didn’t handle rejection well and my words were hurtful to my friend (“someone like you”) because they could be confused for refusing to date a white man due race. Well, this also upset me because I don’t think our friend understands and took an unrelated situation and applied it to himself (he is a white man married to an Asian woman). He asked me to post this for judgement.AITA for insulting the gym staff member?

bi3tz2	AmItheAsshole	My husband values material things highly, and gets upset if something he owns gets damaged in any way. And I’m not talking large, expensive items. If the spine of a paperback book is opened all the way and cracked, it’s ruined. He once returned and reordered a DVD from Amazon 4 times because there were minor cracks on the case. This past Christmas, my parents gifted us a new Apple TV. The remote is glass. We have two boys, a very rambunctious almost 3 year old and a 1 year old. In January, the 3 year old picked the remote up off the couch and dropped it, causing it to crack. I was immediately worried because my husband had been having a terrible week. Let me preface the next few sentences by saying that my husband has never been physically abusive in any way toward me or our children. My husband’s fuse is short. He is angered easily, and he is not a calm angry person. He screams and shouts and says cruel things. Every little thing the 3 year old did that week was setting him off, and I was starting to see the 3 year old being afraid of him. So I told my husband the baby did it. The baby was in a phase of grabbing and throwing anything he could get his hands on, so it was totally plausible. I had assumed that my husband would realize that a tiny defenseless baby would not have done it out of malice, and that he would be much easier on the baby than on the 3 year old. I was wrong. I should have just told him I accidentally dropped it. He would have been furious with me, but that would have been the end of it. From that day on, my husband has shown an obvious and strong favoritism toward our 3 year old. He’s even said on occasion things like, “3 year old is my favorite.” And, “I don’t like baby.” It has honestly broken my heart. The baby feels everything bigger than his brother, and babies are perceptive. Even my mom has commented that she thinks the baby can sense that his father dislikes him. Now to the event I am asking about. Last night, I was cooking dinner, and my husband was supposed to be getting the baby down to sleep. He was getting a cup of milk ready for baby when I noticed baby was crawling around with the Apple TV remote in his hand. I mentioned it to my husband so he could go grab the remote from baby. My husband responded with something along the lines of, “What does it matter? He’s already ruined it.” I responded with, “funny story. It’s actually 3 year old who broke it.” My husband lost it. He called me a liar and said that he couldn’t trust me. He blamed me for his dislike of baby, saying, “you’ll have to live with the fact that YOU are the reason I don’t like baby!” He then told me that I owed him an apology for lying. I absolutely refused. I told him that I would not apologize for trying to protect my child (the 3 year old). Now he won’t even talk to me or be in the same room with me.

bg0yvp	AmItheAsshole	Hello,&amp;#x200B;I wanted to ask: AITA for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?&amp;#x200B;Last month I took part in a retreat. The location's internet didn't work, so we all just had our mobile data. There was a deaf participant from Russia, and he couldn't access the mobile network with his phone. So he asked me if I could give him access through hotspot so he can communicate with his family.I have limited mobile data, I get 500mb per month and from there on, I pay 5 bucks for each 100mb (it's pretty expensive here). I only use mobile data for WhatsApp and maybe sometimes to check my schedule. So I agreed to give him hotspot under the condition that he only uses it for WhatsApp. No videos, no excessive photo transmissions because it's limited. He agreed.&amp;#x200B;But when I got lasts month bill I was kinda shocked: he apparently used over 6GB additionally. I was able to track it down to him because this huge amount of data was consumed during these two retreat days. But before confronting him via Facebook, I asked a friend who was his roommate, if he noticed anything. He told me that this Russian guy did sign language videochat the whole night through with his parents. I asked my friend if he had the impression that it were an emergency, but he said that their chat seemed very lighthearted and included lots of laughing.&amp;#x200B;So I don't know what to do.

And forgive me English is not really my first language.Anyway my girlfriend was cleaning the house today. She started early in the morning and I wasn’t awake when she started. Today is my day off so I would really like to relax, I slept in today until 11am. I expected to wake up peacefully but not really I heard the vacuum very loudly but I just decided to ignore it. I put some headphones on and that was it. My girlfriend is coming in and out of the room to clean and I notice she is looking annoyed. Well she walks in one last time and is all angy with me, and she starts complaining that she’s busting her has cleaning the whole house and that I don’t have the decency to lift a finger to help her. Well I got really mad at that and I told her this is my day off and I simply want to enjoy it but instead I wake up to the vacuum running and now my girlfriend nagging me. I told her she could’ve ASKED me if she want help but it’s not my response lability. She got even more pissed and then left the house and now my mood is absolutely ruined. I just wanted a nice day off.

ea4hnu	AmItheAsshole	"My (20) girlfriend (21) has a very severe phobia of cold things. We live in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.It's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is ""ridiculous"", and she needs to ""get some therapy"" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know how she intends to get through life like this.She was extremely upset and told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she tried to get some help. Just to add, she is okay going outside in the cold air, but as usual won't touch anything cold."

akn3i0	AmItheAsshole	My older sister is going through a messy divorce and she's pregnant. I am graduating college in April and my friends and I are planning to travel from May - August to Europe, East Asia and SEA. We've been making plans for months and discussed the itinerary many times. My sister wants me to cancel the vacation and come stay with her to help with her infant. She's giving birth in April. I told her that I don't want to miss out on this opportunity to travel. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I do not think I will get the chance to travel for an extended period of time with my friends ever again. Unless we're all retired 60 year olds. She called me selfish. But she had the chance to travel after university with her friends too. I think she's being unfair in trying to deny me this opportunity that she had.Both our parents are coming over to help her during the first few months. The father of the child is also committed to helping financially. She argued that both our parents are elderly and would not be of much help. But I don't feel like that's my problem to solve. I've been looking at some affordable domestic workers/hired help to do the household chores so that she can focus on the baby but she shot that suggestion down because she doesn't want to pay extra for outside help. She would rather make me miserable for free. I arranged the baby shower that she complained was too small. I know she's family. It's duty. I don't want my future nephew to suffer. Etc.

dmlcx3	AmItheAsshole	Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we’ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it’s become a great tradition in our social circle. Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn’t push the issue. However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don’t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don’t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don’t believe it’s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?

dv9ogm	AmItheAsshole	My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal.Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids.It's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome. She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?

d0k9el	AmItheAsshole	My wife and I are both 25 and my wife is 8 months pregnant. From even before my wife exams pregnant she’s always been interested in reading stuff and watching videos about pregnancies, birth and raising children. She literally started buying baby clothes before she even got pregnant. Obviously we are both very excited for this baby.However when my wife got pregnant she started talking about how she wanted a home birth and how she has a friend who did it and her friend recommended it. She started watching all these YouTube videos about home birth and said that for normal pregnancies home births had lower rates of maternal morbidity and intervention. It’s something she became very excited about. Honestly I know it’s her body but I just put my foot down. My sister had x normal pregnancy throughout the whole pregnancy and ended up having an emergency c-section. In my opinion ANYTHING could go wrong and I didn’t want to risk my wife’s life or my baby’s life just so my wife could have the experience of home-birth.

I have completely let her decide everything else concerning our baby, I eagerly agreed to do parenting classes and labor and delivery classes. I agreed to have a doula for the birth. I’m taking 6 weeks paternity leave to help her with the baby 100% and anything else concerning delivery she can decide but I just refused to let her have a home birth.

cskg9j	AmItheAsshole	"My husband and I have a 4 year old daughter. We both work, so during the days we have a nanny come in. We still wanted to prioritize family time though.I have been feeling really drained recently, missing the hobbies I did before we had our daughter. Back then; I'd do kickboxing right after work on Mondays and Wednesdays, and yoga right after work on Tuesdays and Thursdays.And I realized I could still swing it, potentially.My time away from home, work and commute combined, is 8:00 am - 4:30 pm. My husband is away from 8:00 am - 7:00 pm because he works longer hours and had a longer commute.If I started going back to working out, I'd still be able to make it home before 6 or 7 every day, and still be able to spend time as a whole family. To be honest, when I have been getting home at 4:30 every day, and taking over from our nanny, all I've wanted to do was zone out. So I mentioned to my husband that I was gonna offer our nanny more hours during the week, so I could get to the gym. He went ""ok"" but didn't seem to be thinking about details, and he didn't ask any more questions.So, for the last few weeks, I've been having our nanny stay till 6:30 every weekday, she's happy to have the extra hours and I'm enjoying getting back to my workouts. Plus I use Friday evening to do some grocery shopping alone because it's a lot easier than doing it with a kid in tow. I was casually taking to my husband about our monthly budget, which I manage because I'm better with cash, and how I was offsetting the cost of having our nanny stay an extra 10 hours a week. I had stopped going out for lunch as often, and I'd replaced some of our usual purchases (soap, TP, detergent, shampoo, etc) with bulk purchases online.And my husband was like ""What, 10 hours? You said you were just going out to the gym sometime"". So I explained my schedule, and he wasn't happy with it. He said he didn't want to be the type of parents who push their kid off on a nanny all the time. Work is one thing, but going out for hours everyday after work was another.I told him about how it made me much more refreshed and happy, the time I all home. So while I'm decreasing the time I'm home a little, I'm really increasing quality time with my family. Because I feel energized rather than drained. I didn't realize how much I missed working out regularly until I got back to it.My husband thinks I'm being selfish; he doesn't like that I want so much time to recharge from family time. He thinks it should be fulfilling, not draining. And I'm honestly happy it is for him. But I'm an introvert, I like being able to spend some time just focusing on my workout and letting go of stress. And I really don't want to give it up, now that I've been doing it for a few weeks.AITA for wanting this much ""me time""?"

ciw8o4	AmItheAsshole	I work at a summer camp where you drop your children off in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon after your work. The camp is funded from the state so the parents have to pay only about 30 USD per week while we take care of their children. It is an IT camp, children from 6-15 are taught how to work with 3D printers, build and code lego robots, make youtube videos, use computers, etc. It was required that the children have some sort of relationship to these kind of things or at least take interest in them. On wednesday we had a new kid show up because he was sick the first two days of the camp. His mother told me how he's only 6 but he's clever as a 9 year old at least. Also she told me how great he is with technology and how awesome his lego building skills are. I believed her and was very happy that we have such a kid. So I take him to the classroom and show him his computer. That's when he tells me that he doesn't know how to read and has never been on a computer, smarthphone or a tablet - basically everything this camp is about. Well, I gave him some lego robots which he could build. He came to me every 2 minutes saying that it's too hard and he can't do that. So basically there was nothing for him to do for the whole week. Later when I talked to the owner of the camp he told me that the mother signed him up for two weeks and he allowed it after she told him her lies. I was really pissed at the kid's mother for abusing the price of the camp and using it as a really cheap daycare. Me and the girl who works there with me persuaded the owner to kick the kid from the camp for the next week because there was nothing for him to do and his mother was lying about his skills.  Now my friend and my girlfriend think that I'm an asshole for this but In my opinion work with children is really exhausting and I can't give all my attention to this kid. So AITA?   tldr; Mother lied about her kid being a second coming of Albert Einstein to get him to IT summer camp. We found out he can't even read and has never used a PC.

I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.​Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.​Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""Me: ""It's John.""​Ted: ""What?""​Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.""​This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""​His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""​Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.​Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""​(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)​As promised, I ignored him.​7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.​I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.​Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""​I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here.

She tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. Recently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. She currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. Problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.On the other hand, I'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. Naturally, my parents think I should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. They say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but I'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.I shut down the idea immediately.

d4grrh	AmItheAsshole	live with my best friend and his girlfriend in a 2 bedroom apartment.Everything has always been smooth and our arrangement works out fine for the most part, everyone split rent evenly. We have 2 bathrooms so one they use in their room and I took over the other one.Last night it was my turn to do laundry and I needed to switch everything over but my boy’s gf still had clothes in the dryer. She was at work and forgot so she texted me if I can just dump her clothes on top of the dryer and she will take care of it later.I had no problem with this but when I started taking her clothes out I saw these button pad things in there. I was kinda weirded out because they looked like diapers so when she got home I asked her what those are for.She told me they are washable pads. Like for her period. I wasn’t mean or tried to be rude but I asked her if she’s seriously washing used bloody pads in our communal laundry. She said yes. I was honest and told her that’s a little gross and that I thought pads were meant to be disposable for a reason. She got upset and said there’s no reason why she shouldn’t wash them with the rest of her clothes and if I expected her to go to a laundromat. I told her no of course not but maybe to hand wash them next time in her bathroom.She told her bf about it and he said I crossed a line and to apologize. Just to keep the peace I did but she’s been giving me attitude since. I don’t think it was unreasonable to ask her to just clean them in her bathroom because they are essentially covered in blood.

d1btlg	AmItheAsshole	I’m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit.

Some examples: He doesn't open doors for me or let me walk through doors first, usually he walks through doors first to the point of letting it almost close on my face, if he sees me carry something heavy or struggle to reach something high he doesn't offer to help, he usually walks ahead of me even if I have to struggle to keep up, if he's driving he'll get in the car first and close the door and get comfy/settled before even unlocking my door so I'm just standing outside the car for a while, when I get home from work he just nods and mumbles ""hey"" rather than give me a hug or even a smile, things like that. I don't think he means to be a jerk and if he were just a friend I wouldn't think too much of it, but it just comes off as rude to me since I'm his girlfriend and I feel like he should treat me more courteously than a buddy. Sometimes it's embarrassing, like last week we were leaving a restaurant and as usual he walked out the door first and it almost closed on my face because I was looking at my phone. Another couple entering the restaurant gave him a dirty look, went ""geez"" and held the door open for me themselves. I felt so humiliated.When I tell him these things bother me and ask him if he could do things like hold the door for me, help me carry things, not walk in front of me, unlock my car door before getting comfy, etc., he accuses me of wanting to be treated like I'm ""better"" than him or put on a pedestal just because I'm a woman. I mean, he's right that I wouldn't expect those things to happen between two male friends, so I guess it is ""just because I'm a woman"" technically.He says it's important for him to treat his partner like his equal, and wants a partner who wants that, too. He pretty much dismisses my complaint because I am from a more traditional culture so he pretty much says any gender-norm-based things that I'm accustomed to, don't apply in the US. AITA for expecting gender-based courtesy from my SO?"

bxumsi	AmItheAsshole	Wife and I got married as widowers. My late wife and daughter passed away in an accident. My daughter was only 1 when she passed away. My current wife had 3 yo twins when we got married. The girls are 15 now.So, yesterday when wife and I were watching a movie, she told me that the girls were planning a surprise for me on their birthday. And when I asked her what it was, she told me that they wanted me to adopt them. I was really happy, because it meant that I had done a good job, but unfortunately I cannot adopt them. I'm actually glad that my wife told me that. A surprise would have caught me off guard. The thing is, my wife and I had discussed about this when they were young. I made it clear that I didn't want to adopt anyone or have more children. Call it coping up with my daughter's death or whatever, but I've never felt comfortable thinking about it. My wife is now asking me to say yes. I've been there for them and I'll always be there for them. I love them but I don't think I'll be comfortable adopting them. WIBTA here?

c4fqqn	AmItheAsshole	I guess it should be are “we” the assholes, but idk if that’s an accepted acronym here. Apologies that the line up is a bit complicated but I’ll try to lay it out as best I can. My family is going on a group vacation this summer. We are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. My husband and I are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. It will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (Kids’ ages range from 3 to 9). In addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.We initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who I think they’ve been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. My sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and I don’t get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. So as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any PDA in front of the kids. We were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. My sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. At this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. I’m conflicted though. She’s my sister and I obviously love her. But I also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation. Are we wrong?

efo54d	AmItheAsshole	I have two daughters with my husband ages 9 and 5, as well as a 12 year old stepdaughter from his previous marriage.After we opened our presents this Christmas morning, we did several family Christmas photos together. We did the first few photos with everybody including my stepdaughter, and the rest of them with just me, my husband, and our children.Later, I found my stepdaughter crying in her room. I asked her what was going on, and she told me that she was upset that I had left her out of few of the photos, and that she thinks it's because I hate her. She also said that her half-siblings got better and more presents than she did. I asked her if her mom got her any presents, and she said no. After I told her that it's because they're younger and not because I'm favoring them over her, she completely lost it and said that she doesn't want to be a part of this family anymore.I honestly don't know what to do, and am wondering if I have truly done something wrong here.

She asked if she could not in the middle of us.We said ""should have seat selected then, no"".She explained that this is her connecting flight via codeshare and she could only seat select on the main legs of her flight with the airline operating them, but not this ticket.

We were disappointed someone was put in the middle but I wanted the window, mate wanted the aisle.Instead of accepting this, she started typing something on her phone and flagged down a flight attendant and passed them the phone.

They doubled down and said one of us has to move so I said ""fine, bitch can have the window"".

One of the things that we don’t always see eye to eye on is food- I love to cook and experiment with food, and he is very much a meat and potatoes kinda guy. I recently ate a steak that was well done that tasted REALLY good. I know there’s going to be a lot of people turning their noses up and saying ‘impossible’ but honestly, it was delicious and I wanted to try and recreate it at home. I asked my boyfriend if he would be interested if I purchased some steaks and I specified it was an experiment to give the well done steak a try at home. He said he was on board. On the day of I prepped and was ready to go. At the last minute he decided he wanted it rare. I was super disappointed and irritated because I wouldn’t have ordinarily bought the steaks midweek, it was specially to give this a try- and I was excited because I thought he could try it and I had a feeling he’d enjoy it.I said I was NOT preparing him a rare steak. I said if he wanted to cook his own steak rare that was fine but I had been excited to prepare this for him. I ended up cooking my own steak and he ended up making his own.

apfejh	AmItheAsshole	Hello, long time follower, first time poster. So my boyfriend knows that I have a lot of body image issues. I am a little overweight, and I struggle with it. I’ve tried a myriad of different diet plans and exercise routines over the years, but nothing seems to stick. My boyfriend and I both really want to have a big family, and I’ve confided in him before that I can’t wait to have a baby, but the thought of being pregnant gives me a lot of anxiety because I don’t want to gain weight.So last night he calls me out of the blue, and says he just wanted to say “I love you so much, and I can’t wait to marry you and have babies with you because you’ll make such a wonderful mother...” and my heart is so full hearing this, and then he goes “...but I can’t have you go and ballooning up each pregnancy. You’ll be 300 pounds by the time we’re done having kids, and I’m not having sex with no big fat slob” and when I pushed back, he doubled down and set me guidelines of how much weight I am allowed to gain each pregnancy, and that after birth, I’ll get one month to “relax”, then two months to get back to my pre-baby weight, and then I’ll get pregnant again, and repeat.  So we fought about it. I said he was being insensitive, and treating me like a sex-and-baby machine and not a human being. He tried to say he was only worried about my health (his dad died when he was a child from diabetes) and I was okay with that argument, but in trying to explain his health concerns, he kept digressing into such gems as: I’m not gonna stay married to you if i don’t get hard looking at youDo you want our kids to be embarrassed by you? Do you want them to say “daddy, can you drop us off as school instead of mommy, because the other kids make fun of the way mommy waddles?I love you, but my love is conditional, and the condition is not gaining more than 30 pounds. When the scale hits 31, I’m signing the divorce papers.If you told me not to weigh 300 lbs, I’d say “sure thing, babe, you’re right” but the fact that you won’t agree to it means that you must actually WANT to weigh 300 lbs, so if that’s your goal, good luck but we’re breaking up if that’s what you wantDo you want our kids to be fat fucks too? You want to give them insulin shots in kindergarten because you and the babies sit on the couch all day feeding each other Ding Dongs? We’ve had a lot of fights in the past around my boyfriend being blunt by nature, and me being overly sensitive by nature, but I really think he was out of line. And the whole conversation came out of nowhere, which really makes me feel like my weight is something that was just eating away at him and he had to get it off his chest. But should I just let it go if he insists he’s only worried about my health? With his family history, it’s understandable that he’d worry about obesity and have a bit of a complex around it, and he is insisting that he’s not asking for too much so I should just agree to it since gaining minimal weight is also what I want, so I shouldn’t fight him and we just be in agreement?

bmywa5	AmItheAsshole	"Yeah, I know this sounds awful.My (32M) wife's (35F) daughter (16F) recently announced she is pregnant. She claims she doesn't know who the father is. I suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. I mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? It can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.Anyway, moving on. She is adamant on keeping the baby. Abortion is out of the question apparently. Wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. They're both ecstatic.The problem I have with this is:1. My wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. She's still in school and fully intends to go to college. My wife and I will 100% end up looking after it.2. I am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. My wife works part time and makes very little money. I don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.3. I wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. She's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. I feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.I raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing.

We will support her.""I agree it's her decision, but why do I have to support her?As it stands now, I'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child.

d9m02m	AmItheAsshole	About two months ago, my husband and I got “married” in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it’s their only daughter’s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn’t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he “proposed” (something I didn’t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren’t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn’t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I’ll call her Carol) and I aren’t close. She’s fine enough in low doses, but...We’re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must’ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a “gift grab” (our wedding website stated that someone’s presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband’s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I’ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes.

d7cdr4	AmItheAsshole	This situation has been ongoing the last year and is causing a lot of damage in my family. Little backstory. My parents divorced when I was 15, mom never remarried and my older brother and I are very close to her. My father remarried maybe 6 years later to a woman who had 3 kids already. There was never a discussion on my fathers end about what him getting remarried entailed, and what my brother and I thought about having step siblings as well as a step mother. If he would have, we would have told him we’re happy but not looking for additional family. Glad you’re getting married and happy for you. Fast forward and I’m now 36, my brother 38, we don’t consider this woman our step mother or step siblings. We like this woman, glad she’s making my father happy  and all, but don’t consider her or her kids “family.”  We’ve had our problems with her, but always tried to make this right and let my father do his thing. Now to the problem. My son is about to turn 1, and my father keeps pushing grandma title on me. I’ve told him 3 separate times now that we would prefer to save grandma for my mom and my wife’s mother, not step parents. My brother has told my father the same thing. She has her own kids and when they have kids, she will be a grandma, but since she isn’t my mom, these aren’t her grandkids.  So am I the asshole for not wanting this woman to be called grandma?

So I said ""fine whatever."" And then as she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. And I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" She says ""the gift bags."" I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified""What the fuck is this?"" she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares?

aq5jde	AmItheAsshole	During a long road trip I stopped off with my 4yo daughter for dinner at a family run rest stop type café/restaurant we’ve been to many times before. My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  She’d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.A bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she’d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she’d been pretty funny.When he brought the food over though he didn’t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her “do you know you are really beautiful?” She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn’t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said “the man is talking to you” he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you.

b4qz08	AmItheAsshole	"I truly want an honest opinion so I'm going to include all details I can w/in char limit, even ones that aren't flattering to me. I've been dating my GF for about a month. honestly I feel much stronger about her than she does me, but I'm hoping she comes around. She is on our university gymnastics team and is an incredible athlete. I went to her meet this afternoon and was freaking shocked to see how much of her floor routine had ""sexual"" elements. She did her routine to ""p'on da replay"" and as an example she crawled on all fours, she shook her ass, she did this thing where she went up and down her body with her finger (including her breasts) and then acted like her finger was sizzling. And during all this, her teammates cheered. I was blown away that this sort of sexuality was not only allowed but encouraged. After the meet I told her I didn't think she should do that sort of stuff. She told me that it was normal for gymnastics and that her routine had been worked out for years with coaches and choreographers. I told her it was normal for strippers who danced for dollar bills. She told me I didn't get it. I told her that I didn't understand what was to get, I was her boyfriend and it was my job to look out for her. She told me ""you are literally and asshole and way overstepping your bounds!"" I told her that I didn't want to fight and she said it was too late. So instead of her going on a romantic date I had planned, she decided to hang out with her teammates. I am so upset because I was counting on seeing her tonight. Based on what she said, am I the asshole for thinking her routine should be less sexy and telling her so?"

chu4ac	AmItheAsshole	Last weekend, my wife texted saying she was planning on buying a new phone. I had no problem with that as her old phone was starting to shit the bed, but when I got home from work the following conversation happened:Me: What kind of phone did you get?Her: I don't know, the iphone something. Not the newest one.Me: How much did it cost?Her: It's only $20 per month?Me: How much did the phone cost?Her: 6-something.I was stunned that she would spend over $600 without taking to me about it first as I would never even spend more than $100 without discussing it with her. The new phone got delivered, and it's an iPhone XR with a retail price of $750. I told her how mad I was about the spending, and she said it cost $680 since she's a Verizon customer.She has no need for a phone that costs this much, and my own phone -- which I use every day for work -- was only $150. I thought she would spend something similar, and I just can't believe she dropped something like $700 ON A PHONE. She will literally only use it for family photos, Facebook and Amazon. $700 won't break us, but it's two car payments or 3/4 of a mortgage payment and I am super upset she spent that much.We are going on vacation this week, and I'm thinking about saying that she should return the phone and buy something cheaper after we get back. So WIBTA for demanding that she return it?

bqflu9	AmItheAsshole	Married 5 years, no children. So I have some baggage, first and foremost. I was the oldest of 5 and my mom was an abusive alcoholic. Dad not in the picture. I was forced to raise my younger sibs as a result and hated it. I really had no childhood and went back to college in my late 20s because I never had the chance to focus on myself. As a result I really cannot stand children until the age of 14. I can’t stand their shrieks, their erratic movements, their whining, their sticky hands, their drool. I can go on. My husband and I are both childless and we’re happy that way. Two years ago my husbands brother and sisters started popping out children nearly at the same time. He now has a niece and nephew both under 2 year old. They live about 30-40 minutes away. My husband wants his sister and her baby to come over during the day (he works from home) so they can have lunch or walks together. He needs to stay at ours in order to work, but they like the idea of spending an hour together in the middle of the day while my SIL plays with her baby for 2-3 hrs. I really don’t feel comfortable with this and have told him so. There’s something deeply uncomfortable with having young children in my living space, even when I’m not there. I would hate coming home to the smell of diapers or baby food or spit up. We’re fighting because my husband thinks I’m being unreasonable to ban all children from our home even when I’m not there. I think since it’s our shared home I should get a say on which guests can enter. AITA?

d4lxcu	AmItheAsshole	Throw away and beyond, going to keep some details vague. I am a person in my teens, have some birth defects and was adopted at a very young age.Last week it was broken to me that my birth parents are actually my adoptive parent's distant cousins. They gave me away for adoption and are now married and has a son, my biological brother who had no idea that I existed. I have actually met the family twice during big family gatherings at my grandfather's house and had no idea who they were. I guess it was kept a secret too because nobody among the relatives talked about it.Just out of curiosity I looked up their contact details and messaged my birth mother. I love my adoptive parents, but I want to get to know my biological family a little more, especially my brother, he is 11 years old now, not that far from me.She asked me to not message or try to contact her family before blocking me. I tried messaging my birth father, and he took very long to reply me. He was more patient and explained to me that he wants me to put my focus on my adoptive parents and we are all better off without each others. When I asked to talk with him face to face, he blocked me too.This just makes me so angry. They are not divorced or child free but they just gave me up for adoption? Is it because of my birth defects? I looked up into social media and saw that those 2 had quite some reputation as public servants. I sent emails with my pictures attached to their workplace and on social media and announced that I am their kid, take a good look at me because this nice couple have gave me up. Who knows, maybe they will even get into the local news.

csh3e8	AmItheAsshole	My 14 year old daughter and I generally have a good relationship, she's well behaved, does well in school and has a good social life. Growing up, both her mother and I were very much of the belief that she should always be playing some sort of sport, tennis, netball, gymnastics, she tried out a bit of everything. She never really found something that she loved, and so now that she is in highschool and has a few more excuses for not wanting to play sports, e.g. homework and social stuff, I've been less strict on making sure she is involved with physical activity.The past few months I've noticed her just generally moving about less. She walks to and from the bus each day, and does PE at school for under 2 hours a week, so she's not getting nearly the recommended amount of exercise for a kid her age. I've started requiring her to do a bit of exercise each day, not a lot, 10-30 minutes is all. It can be pushups alone in her room, yoga, or if I'm going running I'll drag her kicking and screaming for a few kilometers. Literally anything to just get her off her butt for a bit.I've made sure she understands I'm not doing it to make her lose weight, or for some reason related to that. I purely just want her being physically healthy, as well as socially and mentally.Most of the time after a bit of grumbling she does some exercise, but occasionally she outright refuses. I've yet to punish her for refusing, although I definitely give her the old two thumbs down when she does. If she was refusing to do her homework, something I consider equally as important, I would have no problem forcing her to do it, but something is irking me about the general idea of forcing her to exercise when she doesn't want to.AITA?

dyuoq7	AmItheAsshole	Basically, I think everyone’s overreacting.I’m 23 and I got incredibly drunk at a party two weekends ago and ended up with alcohol poisoning. I do relatively drink a lot, but only in social settings. I spent the rest of weekend in the hospital recovering. It was a one time stupid mistake. Yesterday, I went over to my parent’s house for dinner. When I walked in, they were all sitting in the living room with somebody I’d never seen before.I asked what was going on and my brother told me to sit down. I did and the man I didn’t know started talking. To summarize, he said that my family was worried for me and wanted me to go to treatment.I got upset and said that everyone was being over dramatic and that this was ridiculous. I said that I realized that I had made a mistake drinking that much but this was overkill. I stood up and walked out at that point. My mom ran out after me with the interventionist and said that they only did this because they loved me. I said that everyone was acting crazy and I hopped in my car and went home. My brother has been texting me begging me to reconsider but I haven’t answered. Everyone is crazy overreacting. Getting that drunk is not a normal thing for me. It just happened once and I regret it. I have a good job and I look after myself. I don’t think I need rehab or that intervention. That said, maybe I did handle the intervention the wrong way.

We've had a rough few years with 2 miscarriages and a stillbirth at 37 weeks. So my wife was terrified this whole pregnancy. I am a firefighter and was on duty when my wife went into labour. Her doctor said that it would likely be a while so I decided to stay at the base for a little longer because it is about mayhem and we're never enough people anyway. Then one of my mates gets a call that her grandfather had a heart attack and will probably not make it. Obviously she was devastated. Things got really hectic we got called out to another fire and our captain said one of us could go but not both. I told my colleague not to worry she should go and spend time with her grandfather since it will be her last chance. So I had to go out and missed the birth of my child. I got there 2 hours after my girl was born. I felt horrible and apologised profusely to my wife but she just yelled at me, said I let her down in the scariest moment of her life and then told me to leave. So I left and waited in the hallway. It's been 3 days and she refuses to say anything apart from the bare minimum related to the baby.

cencwh	AmItheAsshole	 ThrowawayOkay, I have a two-month-old and am currently on paternity leave. I’m fortunate to work at a place that’s family-oriented and where I’m a senior employee. I’m able to get a longer than typical paternity leave by working remotely from home. However, I had to go into the office to get documents that could only be accessed on my work computer. I thought I would give my wife a break and let her sleep in. So I grabbed my kid and headed to the office.Only my boss knew I was coming in, so the office was surprised. And as people do, they gravitated towards the baby. Lots of cooing, holding, passing around, etc. This was all taking place inside my office. Then my baby started crying. I told my assistant that she can rock baby or walk around the office and they’ll go back to sleep. My assistant took her outside my office by her desk and I worked on gathering what I needed from my computer.I stop hearing crying and look up to see my assistant on her phone, no baby in her arms. I rush out and ask where my kid is. She said asked one of the interns, let’s call her Mary, to take her because she got a call from a client.Like most places, my office has summer interns who are college students. I’ve only met them once during the interviews months ago but I went on paternity leave before they started and haven’t worked with them like the rest of the office has. I know nothing about them personally since I’ve been out of the office.I went over to where the intern desks are and ask where Mary was and they said she went to the bathroom. I asked if she had my baby they said she thinks so and I asked one of the female employees if she could go to the bathroom to get her. A minute later, they both come back, baby with Mary and diaper bag on her arm.I took my kid from her arms and told her I didn’t appreciate her walking off with my kid. Mary said my assistant asked her to hold the baby and when she did, it seemed like baby needed a diaper change so she went and did that. I told her I appreciate the sentiment but didn’t like the idea of a stranger walking off with my baby.In private, I told my boss that how I felt and that I would feel uncomfortable extending her a job offer at the end of her internship but the status of her employment now was up to my boss to decide.When I told my wife, she said I went too far. The girl was doing a simple task and that she probably was given an “intern task”. I reiterated that the girl was a stranger and we wouldn’t let a stranger change our kid’s diaper anywhere else why work? Work doesn’t stop people from being psychos.

ci2e9b	AmItheAsshole	"My boyfriend and I (I'm female if that matters) have been together 1 year. We live 40 minutes apart. When we spend nights together (up until last week, 5-6 nights a week) we spend them at his place because he has dogs and it's a closer commute to work for both of us. His commute is 5 minutes, mine is 10. Three weeks ago I switched jobs and now we both start work at 7 am (I can really walk in around 7:15 though). It used to be 8:30. I'm quick getting ready so I can be out the door in 20-30 minutes. This means I'd ideally wake up and shower at 6. My boyfriend though, wakes up at 5:40 and doesn't get out of the bathroom until 6:20. Every single day. That's fine. Not even an issue, still time for me to shower and get to work.Except. For whatever reason. And I will never be able to understand this. He doesn't shower until 6. Ever. Never ever. But he turns the freaking water on at 5:40 when he goes in the bathroom and let's it freaking run until 6 am. He uses the time to trim his beard (every freaking day), go pee, wake up, check his phone, whatever. Which not only is a tremendous waste of money and a fucking strain on the environment, but it means that my showers are ICE COLD. I've complained a billion times. He says that it's his routine and he's been doing it since way before he met me. He basically said that if I don't like it, wake up and take a shower before him. Which would mean waking up a full hour earlier than necessary considering there is plenty of time to get ready after him. I complained about it for two weeks, then woke up one week ago today and checked for hot water and it made me so mad that he'd done it again that I told him that I'll no longer be spending the weekdays with him because I'm not going to continue to inconvenience myself and start every morning off of a bad note with an ice cold shower over something that could easily be fixed. I offered to spend Friday and Saturday evenings with him, but have made it clear I'm going home every Sunday afternoon. For a week I've stuck to this. He texted me this morning telling me that he's looking forward to seeing me today but that he thinks I'm being very overdramatic about the situation and need to get over it before I ruin our relationship over something ""so stupid"".

b7oc7h	AmItheAsshole	Hello,This is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/This last month has been kind of wild for me so I haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. This spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. At the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact.

czn08t	AmItheAsshole	My ex and I were high school sweethearts and we were together for around 6 years.

This was in 2012 and we literally haven't seen each other or talked since but we still have some mutual friends from high school and uni.One of those mutual friends got married last month and I was in the wedding party. When he and his fiance were putting together the guest list I asked them not to invite my ex. Weddings are hard enough when you're single and I really just wanted to celebrate and enjoy my friend's wedding in peace. I didn't want to stress about running into my ex and his new wife all night. They understood and they did not invite my ex to their wedding. Recently I was hanging out with some friends and my ex got brought up and someone asked why he missed the wedding. The bride explained he wasn't invited because of me. I saw some of the other people exchange glances with each other like it was weird. But no one actually said anything to me.One of my best friend is getting married at the end of the year on NYE and I'm a bridesmaid and I asked her to not invite my ex to her wedding for the same reasons. They haven't sent out invitations yet but as far as I know he will not be invited.I feel like since I'm in the wedding party it's not unfair of me to ask my friends for this favor so I don't feel uncomfortable. I probably wouldn't have asked them if I was just a regular guest. Also I'm much closer friends with the couples getting married than my ex is and I think if they really wanted him to be there then they wouldn't have uninvited him just because I asked.

c5nfrj	AmItheAsshole	"My parents are born again Christians (Pentecostal Evangelists), I left religion at 16.They wanted to arrange my marriage and had suggested a few laughable candidates over the years (from when I was 15 years old).Four years ago (when I was 21) I told them I had gone on a few dates with a guy I really liked and had known for a month. They were generally chill so I didn't feel too worried telling them.The next morning they kicked me out with my 17 year old youngest sister for ""living an immoral lifestyle they can't support"" and turning away from the family values that they raised us with. A year later my other sister (20 at the time) was kicked out for the same reasons.After knowing my now fiance for two months we took a huge risk and moved in together. Thank god that worked out, I've achieved more than I ever thought I could with his support.I can't think of anything I would change about my fiance. For the first year of our relationship my parents caused drama. They used any opportunity I was alone with them to tell me that our relationship was doomed, until I threatened to cut them out of my life.  For the rest of the years they were always sheepish around my fiance and never made much of an effort to talk to him.After we became engaged (late last year) my parents suddenly did a u-turn and seem to have accepted my fiance as a part of the family. Which has been a massive mind fuck to me.At our engagement party we specifically said NO SPEECHS as my dad likes to make himself the centre of attention and does anything to look good.

My father got wind of it through the grapevine and apparently lost his nut (as expected, and why I was hesitant to bring it up).A few weeks ago my father tearfully apologised to my fiance for not accepting him in the beginning and to me for saying horrible things. He said he would be okay with my grandfather walking me down the aisle and hoped we could be friends again like we were before I met my fiance. The other day my mother came by and I brought up the aisle walking to double check it was okay before I asked my grandfather. She told me my father is really hurt and that it's not normal to not let him do it. She also repeated multiple times that they have to be happy for my marriage. I told her that after my father apologised I softened, and was going to let them have speeches. Whereas beforehand I intended for them to come only as guests.

dll9bx	AmItheAsshole	"I have three kids, two boys aged 20 and 19, and a daughter aged 24. My ex husband is still very close with us and we remain basically best friends. We all planned a vacation together to cape cod, but we sort of came to the conclusion that we shouldn't invite my daughter Laura. Laura... she can be a mean person. She is quick to anger and can be extremely demanding to others (especially aimed at her two brothers) and sometimes even just a night out to dinner with her can be hard to get through because of the way she acts. I just wanna give a quick example, we went to my cousins wedding and had to sleep over my sisters house the night before. My son had a blanket on the couch, and left it there while he went to go make breakfast. Laura, when she woke up, looked at the blanket, then asked him furiously ""are you going to fucking pick this up? You're just going to fucking leave this here like some slob? Pick it the fuck up"" at a volume that most of the people in the house could hear. My son doesn't even want to talk back to her for fear of escalating her anger, so he just did it. Another example is that my son left a pan in the sink to soak before washing it, and she flipped a shit and started calling him lazy and a brat and all this stuff. Over one pan. One time she asked my husband to do Yoga and he didn't want to, and she basically started berating him for being unhealthy and making his refusal to do yoga into this big thing. One time my son was having a migraine and had to cancel going to his aunts dinner, and Laura just absolutely berated him and insulted him for not 'sucking the pain up and going'. That is a microcosm of how she acts, not only to them, but to us as well, and her boyfriends and friends. If she finds even the slightest thing wrong with someone, she will point it out, viciously. She can also be funny and charming and talkative! She isn't all bad. But she seems to have a problem when it comes to not being able to keep quiet over even slight things she finds annoying.

It only takes one of her 'attacks' at us to really dampen the mood, especially when she starts insulting peoples characters and demeaning them.

My GF's family is filthy rich and even she'll admit she's spoiled, everything paid for and a 3k a month allowance. Because of this she's never had a job, doesn't care about school really (She's doing fine though but in a easy program), or about having to make money in the future. My car broke down recently and I've been taking the bus/subway to work and she's been razzing me about it saying its sketchy taking public transport etc. I told her I'm saving up again for a honda, and will get it next month. She just tells me to ask my parents for the money or dip into my savings. I told her she has no idea how most people live real life so she shouldn't be giving out financial advice because her dad funds her whole life. She got very pissed at me and said that she's not dumb and so on and basically called me a huge asshole.

dufzum	AmItheAsshole	"My sons 10th birthday is next saturday and me and my husband have been planned a party for him. To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david. The school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a ""normal"" class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david. Well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up.

cpa8mv	AmItheAsshole	Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.My mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. So AITA?

cj4dqw	AmItheAsshole	My friend, we’ll call her Bridget, is one of those “not like other girls” people. She makes those posts on Facebook, talks about it, etc. It can get a bit annoying, but the biggest issue I have with it, is that she “has no filter”. Now, I’m all for speaking your mind because free speech and all of that. But there are times when you need to have a filter. She’s the type to point out when things are awkward between two people, but they’re pretending to be civil for the sake of the group and just get through this outing, before they don’t have to see each other again. Doesn’t happen often, but it’s happened a couple of times when people have had an argument or don’t like each other and then things are even more awkward.If someone is on their phone a bit, she’ll wave her hand in front of their face and say “Hey there” and then call them on it. If they have a fashion sense that’s odd to her, she’ll make fun of them, even if they ask her to stop. She’ll also tell you really random, graphic stories about her past, the same ones over and over. It’s sad the first time, but your cocktail anecdote should not be “My house burned down when I was 11 and my uncles died two days apart, plus I think they haunt me.” (The uncles didn’t die related to the fire, they died of terrible diseases and these are tragic stories, and I’m sorry they happened, btw, I’m not trying to make light of it.) It makes people feel awkward, which you guess it…she calls them on and laughs about.If you call her out on any of this, “I have no filter”. A lot of our friends don’t like this, but a bulk of them (including myself for a bit until she did this with me for way to long about the clothes) chalk it up to “That’s just Bridget”.The other night, we were all hanging out and one of the guys had brought his new girlfriend. We were all talking about fairly, light, funny topics. Suddenly, Bridget brings up her uncles and started talking about their sickness, in excruciating detail. I can tell that the new girlfriend was getting pretty weirded out and I told her “Hey, maybe we can talk about the time they took you fishing. That’s a funny one.” But no, she continued until she was done. Then the room got quiet, as it always does after she tells this horrible, awful story about two men dying of cancer and she looks around, bursts into laughter and goes “Well, now none of you have anything to say.”Our friend’s new girl looks humiliated and I just feel so bad for her. I say, “Bridget, you need to cut this out. If you keep this up, people are going to stop inviting you to hang out with us. No one likes the way you talk to them. We’ve told you in the past.” She looked incredibly hurt and I said “Sorry, I don’t have a filter.”Apparently, Bridget is still incredibly hurt and thinks I’m an ass.

All 5 of them know that I eat vegan. I have kindly asked if we could pick a place where I could order a regular dish, but I did not require a strictly vegan restaurant, as it's their decision what they decide to eat. We live in a capital city in western europe, meaning there are plenty of such places.However, my friends have mocked me for my decision to not eat animal products and have chosen a place without a single vegan option, joking along ""it won't hurt once in a while"", ""just half a year ago we were in a steakhouse with you"", ""give up your trendy diet and eat like a normal person"" etc. I said that it's rude to not respect my choices and that it's also insensitive due to the fact that they can eat vegan food with no issues, but I don't want to eat non-vegan food. Besides, there are places that offer both options and I don't want to go to a fancy restaurant to eat grilled veggies and plain rice.They have decided to run the event anyway and organized it in a restaurant that had ONE vegetarian option and no vegan option - meat included in all dishes.

A day later, we went together to pick out an engagement ring.

My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. &amp;#x200B;A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. &amp;#x200B;Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to ""think of them"". I told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.&amp;#x200B;Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to Disneyland"".

I pull up and one of the guys working up there, Bruce, tells me that there’s a two hour wait since they’re really busy. Now normally, I’m not one to fuss, but me and the shop owner Jeremy have a gentleman’s agreement where I’ve been going to him and his shop for about 25 years now, he’ll usually put me ahead of the line and save me some time. But two hours was too long for me today since I had a few appointments coming up and I told the first guy Bruce as much. I guess Bruce doesn’t know or doesn’t care about the arrangement me and Jeremy has and tells me if I want it done any faster I would have to change it myself. Now I’m no dummy and I know my way around the car I’ve had for 30 years. So I make a run over to the auto parts store and pick up a few quarts of oil and a filter. I return to the parking lot of Jeremy’s shop and begin doing exactly what Bruce suggested I do, and I change my oil right there in the parking lot. It ends up making a much larger mess than I figured it would, but I’m able to clean up most of it before I go on my way. Jeremy calls me later and asks about what happened and I tell him, he thought it was pretty funny but just not to do it again and to try calling ahead when I needed another change so they could schedule better.

d59br7	AmItheAsshole	I (22f) and my friend (21f) recently booked an Airbnb apartment for a week long holiday to the beach. We both brought along our boyfriends, who we have both been with for around 3 years. We talk often about sex, what we're up to, issues if we have any, just normal girl stuff. I've confided in her before that me and my boyfriend don't really have sex anymore because of work and he's on antidepressants, and it really gets me down. The last time I told her about this was a couple of months ago. She often tells me little funny things that happened while she was having sex, and if anything happens to me, I tell her too. When we went on holiday, I assumed that she wouldn't be having sex with her partner.  My boyfriend has always made it clear he finds it weird to have sex in hotels/not his own house or mine, and he was my first partner so I assumed it was a normal view. I have to admit, I also didn't want to risk hearing her have sex because I'm really insecure that I'm not, and also because, to be honest, I feel like my relationship is going downhill and I'm jealous that after the same amount of time, her relationship is near perfect (from her own words). I think it's normal for relationships to not be as exciting and sexy as they were at the start and I honestly think that because hers seems to be, they're probably forcing it or actually unhappy. Anyway, the first night we were away I went downstairs for a glass of water (their room was ground floor, ours first) and I heard quiet moans from their room. I was immediately super pissed. I had tried it on with my bf in the shower earlier (I thought he would be ok with that because the mess would just wash away) but it hadn't worked. Without really thinking I opened the door and told them to shut the fuck up. She immediately looked horrified and covered up, and said they weren't being loud. I rolled my eyes and said that it was 'gross, disrespectful to me, and honestly just weird' and then went to bed. Things are not the same after this but I can't believe she would do something like that. AITA?

I got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""Andy, Sara, Kate"". I had these tattoos all done at once after Kate was born knowing she would be my last. My oldest child Andy[T22] came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now.

The problem arose yesterday when my wife and Athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. The tattoo going down my arm still reads ""Andy"" and not ""Athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""Andy"" to ""Athena"". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of. I explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that I don't understand why this needs to be brought up now.

dh9dfp	AmItheAsshole	My boyfriend and I [both 25M] have been dating for almost a decade. For the most part, our relationship is pretty great. But my boyfriend is a very sensitive person and has a lot of emotional baggage. He’s had a bit of a difficult life and can get spun out over minor inconveniences pretty easily. This is not usually in a toxic “taking it out on me/others” kind of way; more so he becomes too upset to function normally and needs a lot of support/comfort. This especially happens in the Fall, since he’s experienced a lot of loss around this time of year and tends to be a bit fragile.Every year, he visits his grandfather’s grave on what would have been his grandfather’s birthday. The grandfather passed when we were in high school (so about 7 years ago) and I attended the funeral at the time. Several years have passed, but they were close so my boyfriend always tends to get pretty upset around this time of year.Skipping forward to this week, my boyfriend had a very bad day at work and was spinning out about how he hates this time of year and how he was upset. As usual, I was giving him an outlet and trying to cheer him up. While doing so, he asked if I would visit his grandfather’s grave with him and his mother this weekend. As mentioned earlier, I had attended the funeral 7 years prior. But I had never gone to (nor been asked to) go to the grave with him before.I told him him that I would prefer not to visit the grave with him and that doing so would make me uncomfortable. He asked me to clarify, so I explained I’m not a big fan of cemeteries (not that I’m creeped out by them, but just being there makes me uncomfortable and I feel no connection to the deceased by being there) and that I don’t even go to my own deceased family’s graves. I also explained that I’ve been stretched pretty thin at work lately (which he is aware of) and didn’t want to give up 3-4 hours of my weekend.We didn’t have a big blowout over it or anything. But we did have a back-and-forth where he said he could use the support from me and I explained that I felt like I’ve given him a lot of support these last few weeks and that I need to draw the line at some point if supporting him puts me in an uncomfortable position. He understood that, but wished I hadn’t drawn that line at this particular instance.The conversation ended here and we’ve been fine since (it’s been a few days). But he will be visiting the grave this morning and I am worried he might come back resenting that I wasn’t there.I don’t want to misrepresent my boyfriend as an emotional vampire. He’s definitely always there for me when I’m upset (which is admittedly less often than he is upset). And I also want to make clear that he is not an emotional wreck all of the time, though he has definitely been a lot more fragile these last two months.So AITA for not just sucking it up and going to the grave with him?

Fast forward a year and a half or so later and I can't even remember the last time I saw her reading a book.

I pointed out that she doesn't read anymore and therefore is not a book nerd, and shoud make a different username.

I tried to explain to her that this is not the same, because listening to something doesn't take as much brain power as reading it does. Audiobooks are like the cheap easy version of a real book.

d6c0g0	AmItheAsshole	"I recently had a second division win on the lottery and after taxes pocketed about $300k - a nice and very handy sum of money, but not the kind of money that will let you set you and your kids up for life. We have two kids who are twins in their late twenties and I'll give them the fake names of Lucas and Carolina. Lucas has a wife and two kids under 5 (being a little vague for privacy). Carolina is single and happy with that for now &amp; doesn't want kids. My husband and I have decided that in addition to taking a holiday, getting a new car, and putting most of it into savings, we  would gift each of our kids $25k each. We also decided we would pay off Carolina's student loans (about $35k, which is not bad for a BA and a MA. She had a scholarship for her masters and only borrowed what she needed for a compulsory internship in an expensive city &amp; the BA amount is pretty standard for where we are) and will pay for Carolina's ICL surgery for her vision (LASIK is not suitable) as she needs very strong glasses (-12) and it is not covered by any insurance or our country's health care system. The surgery is about $12k. Carolina has been saving for it herself, I told her to use the money and treat herself to a holiday.Lucas says that I am being unfair and favouring Carolina &amp; and that he should get the extra $47k Carolina is essentially getting, especially because ""I have kids and she doesn't and she has a better job anyway"". I don't think I am being unfair.If Lucas went to University, I'd have settled his debt too or paid the same amount off each of their balances, depending on the amounts. But Lucas chose to drop out of school in 10th grade. Her better job is the result of her putting in more years of education. I'd also pay for Lucas to have eye surgery if he needed it. But he doesn't. Carolina has missed out on things because of her vision and that he has benefited in the years - she is not allowed to have a licence because of it and a few years ago when my husband and I bought a new car, we gave Lucas our old one which we could have traded in for about $6k &amp; paid for driving lessons. Carolina didn't complain about it or demand money of her own.I also think giving him $47k to ""play"" with is different to covering an educational debt and a health expense. It also punishes Carolina - she gets a necessary surgery and educational expenses while her brother gets extra free ""fun"" money. He asks ""what about my kids"". I actually am putting aside some money for their educations (I plan to give both $10k + whatever interest it gets towards educational costs if they go to Uni) but have not told him this, but ultimately, while I love my grandkids, they are his responsibility to provide for. Lucas continues to insist I am favouring Carolina and making comments that she is the preferred golden child.

e1359t	AmItheAsshole	I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 4 years, living together for one year now. We’re both 26. Our relationship has been great for the most part but I noticed that since we moved in together my girlfriend has been talking more and more about having children, her Pinterest is filled with stuff about baby clothes, nursery decorating and raising kids (as well as tons of wedding stuff). She follows a lot of family accounts on Instagram she would once in a while send me videos of kids and say “lol this is totally our future kid) I was very adamant  that I wanted to wait until we could afford a house, pay off some debts and establish our careers  before getting married and then we would have kids. She just finished her masters and I finished physiotherapist school and would love to start my own physiotherapy business in the future. She always agreed that we weren’t ready for kids but it was obvious she had intense baby fever. My girlfriend is on birth control and takes the depo provera shot every 3 months. 3 days ago my girlfriend tells me that she’s 2 months pregnant and she just found out. I was absolutely shocked. Honestly I suggested an abortion at this point but my girlfriend was adamant against it and said she was pretty excited for the baby and was mad I was even suggesting abortion. So honestly,  I did accuse her of intentionally getting pregnant because it honestly just made the most sense. She was acting so excited like it was planned, her past behaviour showed she was looking forward to a baby and I never followed up to make sure she was getting all her shots. She had been on the same form of birth control our entire relationship with barely a pregnancy scare and suddenly she’s pregnant? When I accused her of getting pregnant on purpose she got mad at me and says she would have never done that and she knows that it isn’t the perfect time to have a child and she been getting all her depo shots but “God had other plans” and we could make it work. I again accused her of lying and this was just too much of a coincidence. We argue back and forth and she gets really angry and runs away to her moms house.  She then texts me a picture of a receipt for her most recent depo shot 9 weeks ago with the caption “you are a fucking asshole”. She blocked me and refuses to respond to any of my messages.

She received over 20 injuries (lacerated liver, broken ribs, punctured lung, bruised lung, left foot torn off, just to name a few). She had to be flown to the city to receive treatment. I was devastated to  hear her go through this.  Despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. After months of visiting Anna, sitting by her, I was getting drained. Her parents eventually told me (in a very kind way) that she would want me to find someone new and that I shouldn't let this be the end of my 'dating career' (I am 20yo). So after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in God, I put myself back out there. I eventually met a new girl who I loved (Katie), and I saw a lot of traits in her that I saw in my ex. A few days ago (May 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. At first I was extremely upset, but realized Anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). Katie knew about Anna and it was no surprise to her I wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. When I got there, I kissed Anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her I loved her. After the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. I kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again ""I love you). At the funeral I gave her a eulogy (which Katie attended) and told Anna again ""I love you.""After the funeral, Katie was angry with me. She asked what I mean't when I said ""I love you, Anna."" Then I told her about the kiss  because I felt guilty. Now, Katie is now super pissed at me. She is staying with her parents and said I cheated on her. This was not my intention at all though, I just wanted Anna to know (if she was even conscious) that I loved her, and would see her again.

She has always been interested in spiritual and occult things - astrology, tarot cards, sage cleansing, pagan practices, spell rituals, etc., but nothing negative like hexes or ghosts. Most importantly, she has never been hardcore about it. She has a full-time job and is well-adjusted socially. She says she is ""in the broom-closet"" and has lots of books on the topic, but she hides them when either of our parents come over (her closest friends know).

I planned on asking more about it on the date. Next, she wanted to meet up on Easter. I don't personally celebrate, but I know that most places are closed and families usually have plans.

This is the daughter writing the update. My mom didn’t know how to do an update post and asked me to write it for her. We’re both here to respond to comments if you have any.I saw that a few people asked what my aunt’s opinion was after the verdict was given on this post! Here is the answer to that question: My aunt said that she had told my cousin from the beginning that excluding me was going to hurt my feelings and suggested to her that I be a bridesmaid instead of my mother. My cousin turned down this suggestion but would not say why. I also saw some people wondering if something had gone down between my cousin and me that I wasn’t telling my mom. This is definitely valid question! The answer is no, she and I haven’t had any problems prior to this (that I know of, at least). She has always been like a sister to me. If she ever had a problem with me or anything I’ve done I would hope she would tell me.Another question I saw was about my relationship with my father. He and I have a very tense relationship due largely to some mental heath problems that he has. Prior to all of this I had confided in my cousin a lot about this. This made her decision to include him over me hurtful in a very poignant way.After reading all of your comments and some more deliberation, my mom ended up staying in the wedding party. I appreciate her desire to stand up for me but I really did want my cousin’s wedding to go smoothly (despite my feelings being very hurt). My mom respected my wishes. She is an amazing mom all around and I am lucky to have her in my corner. After the conversation I had with my cousin (described in the last post) I was on the fence about attending the wedding. I then heard from other relatives that she was concerned that I would “sabotage the wedding” if I were to attend. I found this comment to be bizarre and confusing. At this point I decided that it would be best to remove myself from the situation entirely. I told her that I wouldn’t be attending and left it at that. It was a hard decision to make, but your reactions to the original post made me feel more confident in my choice.The wedding did end up going smoothly. I heard from multiple sources that there was plenty of extra room in the bridal suite. I wish I could have been there with my family to support her on her big day. She and I have both been part of each other’s major life milestones for as long as I can remember. I still haven’t figured out why I was the only one excluded but I have come to the conclusion that she and I must not be as close as I had always thought we were. At this point I’m not sure that I want to be. Your feedback on the original post played a large part in me realizing that.Thanks to everyone for reading and for all of your responses!

Fiancé has an older sister, we'll call her Sally, who is 28 and has a 5 year old child. I was there the day Sally was in labor and Baby was born, she is my niece. His entire family has referred to me as his Auntie since day 1. I am not blood but we are family, she calls me Auntie and we have sleepovers, zoo visits, etc. 2 years ago Sally was in rehab from drug addiction. Alcohol, pain killers, and Xanax were her thing. She had a mental breakdown and the family collected money to send her to rehab and all organized a schedule to take care of Baby. The baby's dad, Sally's boyfriend, has a welding/construction job and was out of town for 2 months so he wasn't there for all of this. She checked herself out after 3 days, insisting she was ""fine and just needed a safe withdraw"". I pick her up, take her to her house, and she immediately goes to smoke weed and drink a beer. I don't think weed is a drug and am very pro-cannibas although I don't smoke, but that was not appropriate considering I just picked her up from rehab. A week later she was fired for snorting in the bathroom., evicted for being 4 months late, totaled her car driving while high and is being sued for $50k from wrecking into a house, and was kicked out of Fiancé's other sister's house for forgetting the sink was plugged up and running (she was high) and the entire downstairs was RUINED from water damage because nobody else came home for 8 hours. $20,000 of damage and thank god their house insurance covered it. That was all last year. They've been in their new house on their own for about 6 months. In November she called FIL and said their electricity was shut off because she didn't have the money because BF's paycheck got messed up and didn't go through. He paid their late electricity bills.. a total of $500. I thought it was suspiciously expensive but kept my mouth shut. All has been quiet since. Two weeks ago, she asked me to borrow some money to get groceries for Niece.

I come in using my spare key, walk in, see Niece playing with dolls in the corner, Sally passed out on the couch, and heroin on the coffee table. Unfortunately coming from a family riddled with addiction, I know what heroin looks like. I don't know how much it was, but I could have scooped it up and filled my palm with it. I noticed radiators everywhere in the front room and Niece was in multiple layers of clothes and her winter jacket. The heat was off. The house was maybe 40F - it was 30 outside. I took Niece to my car, and called 911 for an ambulance as I was scared Sally was overdosing.  I didn't want to alarm and freak out Niece so I stayed in the car and let her play on my phone until the ambulance arrived. Of course police and CPS showed up as well. I explained the situation and because Niece's dad is out of town working, FIL/MIL were called. When they arrived they were quiet and cold, didn't really talk, took Niece, and told me to go home. An hour later I get home and fiancé asks me what I've done. I explained everything to him and all he had was anger for me. Apparently the entire family already knew and were pissed at me for what I had done. Apparently I was ""out of line and stupid"" because I called 911 before seeing if she was actually OD'ing because it turned out she was just nodding out from the heroin. We fought for hours and I left and spent the night at my best friend's house and cried all night. I couldn't handle it all so I turned my phone off and tried to relax and just calm down. My best friend was up all night with me, telling me I did nothing wrong, and I'm okay. I turn my phone on and I had 65 texts/messages. MIL, FIL, SIL, fiancé, and their extended family members blaming me. They are saying I ruined her life, ruined Niece's life, made everything more complicated than it needed to be, made it public when it was a ""family affair"", and ruined Sally's chances of ever getting cleaned or having custody of her child again, none of them ever want to see me again and I will never see my niece again, and they want me to pay for Sally's jail bond and sue me for the CPS case and emotional damages.I am also now single. So on top of losing my best friend of 10 years (fiancé), I will lose my apartment I had with him, what I considered my family, and my Niece.I truly feel horrible. I have horrible anxiety to the point where I'm worried someone is going to come get ""revenge"" on me for what I did. I can't eat. I have lost 7 pounds from it. I'm not sleeping for shit. I have bags under my eyes. I've had 8 migraine-days in two weeks. At first I felt so confident in my decision but as the days go by I'm thinking maybe they were right and I should have checked on her before calling 911 and being frazzled. I don't care about Sally anymore, but I did rip a 5 year old child away from her parents and I feel horrible about it. I know someone in the family will take her in, but it's never like being with your parents. She will grow up resenting me for it and all I've ever done is love her as my own. Reddit, AITA? Please help me. The guilt is eating me alive. "	LOC	What kind of men would she be bringing into the house then?	<NONUS_AUTHOR>	WTF is wrong with your fiance too?	<US_AUTHOR>	real
c879l2	AmItheAsshole	My children are 17 and 14 respectively, and I’m hoping the fact that they’re teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. My husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in Canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. No one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. I had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. It was at an AA meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the US. I have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. I like to joke that I’m keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. I’ve had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- I am so damaged that I just feel lucky that I got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. We had two children- two sons. We’d never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it’s a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. He has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. My mother in law told the kids this Sunday gone, as she decided it was ‘time for them to know’. She didn’t consult us before telling them, and certainly didn’t do it in our presence. Since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they’ve been prodding their dad asking why we’d never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they’re acting like we’ve kept a secret affair family from them or something. My 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. I broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing I’d ever heard him say. I asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. He told me that it made ‘so much sense’ why we were abnormal, why we don’t drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. the two are pretty heartbroken, and I feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children’s lives as a result of us staying quiet. I am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and I don’t know how to proceed. I have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.

bp8v29	AmItheAsshole	My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.&amp;#x200B;Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.&amp;#x200B;My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified.

We have always both been great parents, 50/50 custody, avoided the ""nastiness"" we've always heard about in other people's split-ups since divorcing and have always been very helpful and civil to each other and the kids.10 years have gone by and it's been incredibly nice, peaceful, and healthy for the kids and ourselves. We all go to my son's football games together, save eachother seats at my daughter's recitals, etc; and in a word..things have been ""perfect"" for a decade until this past year.My Ex's spouse (call him Robert) has been having some anger issues and degrading my children, calling them stupid/worthless, screaming in their faces, breaking their things, punching holes in doors/walls, etc; losing control without provocation and the children are afraid to be there, asking if they can stay with me permanently. He is not laying his hands on them, but the kids fear he will one day and I share their concern. My daughter is 14 and my son 12 and my daughter has Googled her options and is threatening to petition the court to make the choice for them both and has asked me to support her decision.Speaking with their mother and Robert about this, I have tried to hold my daughter's choice off more than once (while feeling awful) to give her the opportunity to sort her household perils. Each time, she has decided to make it work since he is their only provider, doesn't make much, she has no family in the state, they share 1 vehicle due to an unforeseen repair, in mid 40's starting over with a toddler and working to improve their situation, etc; I am more than sympathetic to her desperation to make it work.He is on meds, sees a counselor (all things their mother required after an incident screaming at the kids until they were crying and shaking and couldn't even tell me legibly what had happened) but chance after chance it has not stopped and each time they they call begging me to pick them up before quickly getting off the phone for fear of being discovered.I have decided that I am telling my ex wife this weekend that I will support my daughter in her petition regardless if it ruins our co-parent progress from the last decade because I cannot let my kids think I condone what's happening or will fail them when they ask for my help **...and I feel like a HUMONGOUS asshole** for doing this to my ex wife who's in a very tough situation with seemingly no exit which no doubt makes me feel like I'm kicking her while she's down.

cnsiur	AmItheAsshole	I’m an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. I have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. They get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don’t need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  I used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn’t give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. Even though I’m a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She’d obviously checked with HR and covered her ass. For the last six months I’ve been having my 30 mins ‘meditating’ out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have ‘meditative time’ and it’s causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. I recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and ‘ruining it’ for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. I told her I’m not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.

b2za6i	AmItheAsshole	"Living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. She came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.For her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.Lunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. So I explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured I'd skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn't good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB &amp; J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.I called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""No"" and ""This really shouldn't be a big deal.""This might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up. Just to double check, I asked my daughter two things: Does she LIKE her lunches? (Enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and ""Are the other kids making fun of you?"" because I know that can be an issue. She said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too.

8jb8xk	legaladvice	"18, senior in high school attending my girlfriends senior prom at her school (different school) I was driving down Main St in her village on my way to the school while I was pulled over in my BMW for no front plate.The officer came to my window and asked me if I knew why I was pulled over. I said ""No front plate?"" and he said ""yes, license and registration"". As I proceed to give the officer my credentials he asked me, and I quote ""So where did you get the fake inspection sticker?"". Immediately I got nervous because as a car enthusiast I know what happens when you have fake inspection stickers as a lot of people in my area do this and I told him its not fake. So he goes back to the patrol car and I started freaking out a little bit knowing what could happen. My girlfriend who was in the passenger seat and never experienced anything like this in her life was starting to get nervous but didn't understand the severity of the situation. She tells me that her uncle who is a well known state trooper in the area is good friends with this officer. I had immediately told her to say something. The officer had came back and my girlfriend started to freak out a little bit since she got the hit this wasn't a regular stop she is used to with me for something like a loud exhaust, etc. The officer then proceeds to say ""I'm going to ask you one more time, where did you get the fake inspection from. Are you going to keep lying to me"". So I told the officer the dead honest truth and said how the sticker was from the previous owner of the car and I had just bought it in Brooklyn, NY on January 27th and I had no idea that it was fake and how I got a ticket a little over a month ago for expired inspection. As he reaches into my car and starts scraping it off my windshield. At this point I'm just thinking to myself ""What the hell does he think he is doing"".After a little more nonsense back and fourth with the officer being as respectful as I can be he tells me to turn off the car and sit tight. Now at this point I am almost in tears because my whole life I wanted to be a state trooper and with this on my record that will never happen. I started yelling at my girlfriend which I've never done before because I'm thinking I'm completely screwed and I had 1 chance for her to name drop and she didn't. She now had realized what was about to happen, the officer was about to arrest me. She calls her uncle and tells him what is going on, so he had called the officer that pulled me over while he was in his patrol car doing whatever he was doing. About 5 minutes go by and I could see the tears in her eyes when I seen in my rear view that he was coming back.Assuming right now I'm about to get put in handcuffs and my car was going to get towed, &amp; ruin my girlfriends last prom I rolled my window down and prepared for the worst. The officer had leaned into the window and said to my girlfriend ""(first name), right?"" and she had said ""Yes"". The officer proceeded to explain how he had talked to her uncle and everything. He started talking to me telling me how he didn't want to ruin my life and asked me what I wanted to be and the whole 9 yards. He ended up giving me a ticket for ""No distinctive plate/insecure/dirty"" (4021 Traffic Infraction) as well as ""Displayed forged cert. of inspection"" (306E Misdemeanor). He told me that if I go get the car inspected ASAP and bring it to the court they will most likely drop it as it shows initiative and that there is nothing wrong with the car. I have no clue if this will actually work out like he said it should. Everyone knows that things like this don't just disappear.Currently I'm trying to figure out a way to get my car to pass inspection, I have a highly modified N54 BMW 335i with window tint and catless downpipes (catalytic converters removed). In New York state you are allowed to have 1 monitor failed which in my case as long as I have no check engine light would be my cat monitor. I have very light tint on my windows so I believe that should pass as the max light that tint is allowed to block is 30% being 70% of light must be able to pass through. I may know a few places that can ignore tint, but worst comes to worst I will just peal it off.Now my court date is in exactly 7 days from today (5/21/18).My plan is to get the car inspected, bring proof to the DA before the court date and provide proof that the inspection sticker is not from me and that I was completely oblivious that in New York a car needs to be reinspected upon transfer of ownership. I have email proof with dates before I owned the car with the inspection sticker clearly in the window to show the DA along with proof of when I had purchased the vehicle and registered it in my name. I'm hoping at the least I could get it reduced, but if the DA doesn't want to hear it I feel as if my best be would be to suit up with a lawyer.I need advice and input on my situation please. I'm extremely stressed out and uneasy about this. I haven't been able to sleep or eat since then and it happened on 5/12/18, It's currently 5/14/18. I don't know what to do, and my mother is also freaking out about it but blaming it on me since I recently got a ticket for un-inspected motor vehicle, and to my knowledge it was inspected since the car had a 2018 sticker stating it was good until November which I currently have a lawyer for because of my ignorance to previous owners wrong doings.Again, any advice is greatly appreciated.

He makes significantly more money than I do, but definitely has a drinking problem. He will want to fight me on custody. He has said that in a fight before, and I have no reason to believe he is bluffing...he may be acting like a child, but he is extremely intelligent and vindictive. We live together, have been together for two years, but are not married, are on a lease together that ends in April of 2019. Baby is due November of 2018. My plan was to put a twin bed in the nursery so I can sleep in there when the baby comes, because I can't afford to pay two rents, so I don't think moving out and breaking a lease is an option, especially for my credit...I can hardly afford to pay this rent as it is.Since the baby isn't born yet...what steps can I take to protect myself and my child from potential future abuses of my ex boyfriend? So far, all of the abuse is mental/emotional. There is no physical evidence. A lot of financial control, manipulation, gaslighting, locking me out, withholding, etc, but he hasn't laid hands on me, so the evidence I have is basically he said vs she said. And since his friend has been living with us, hearing some of these fights, I am sure the father of my child will find a way to turn him against me in a court of law through intimidation (he frequently brags about how the roommate is ""scared of him"" so he will listen, like when I am having problems with roommate, etc)In Idaho, should I leave him off of the birth certificate? What would the long-term consequences of that be? If I put him on the BC to get child support (which I will honestly need being a full time student and making only $9/h), how do I protect myself and my son in a coparenting situation? And finally, once the baby is born, how possible, if at all, is it for me to leave the state? Are there any laws in Idaho that would prevent me from being able to cross state lines?I have reached out to a few lawyers, but none will talk to me without paying a retainer...I just can't afford that.\--Also...I don't need the whole song and dance about how I ""shouldn't have gotten pregnant with him"".

99pabb	legaladvice	Hi Everyone!  First time poster in this thread.  I have a car that was bought brand new in 2016.  Never had any issues with it until a company van hit my parked car (I was in the grocery store) cause $2200 in damages.I finally got the check for it to be fixed, and they set me up for a rental, but will not cover rental insurance which approximates $250.  Also, I inquired about diminished value and am not sure they will pay it.After running numbers to determine diminished value (was very conservative in running them) the outcome equates to roughly $500.All in all, I might be out $750.  Is this enough headache to sue?  I don't understand why I am out this money for someone else doing the damages.Thanks!

9ad6jp	legaladvice	[Indiana]  My car was parked, I was at work, bunch of people ran in asking if the car was mine, it was.  They said a man parked his truck but left it it neutral, truck rolled into my front bumper, pushed the car backwards up the curb behind it.  Guy got out, looked at my car, hopped back in his truck, and sped off.  As I mentioned they got his plate number, description of the truck, description of the guy, and even a picture of him after the accident, I'm not sure if he's in the picture the officer looked at it.  All 4 people gave me their names and phone numbers.The officer went to his house and at first the guy denied it, said it must have been his son, but the officer told him multiple people described him, and they got his plate number.  He had been drinking but the officer couldn't prove he was drinking when the accident occured.  The man in question, according to the officer, is a very wealthy doctor, and said to give his information to me in the chance we can handle this together - in other words, he wants to pay for the damage.  The damage is very minor on the front bumper.The officer said I have two options, I can press charges, the guy will be charged with a hit and run, and we can go to court, which will cost me money and there's a chance he wouldn't be found guilty, even though with all the proof we have he most likely would be.  OR I can give the guy a call and try to work something out, and if he doesn't hold up his side of the deal then I can still press charges.  I think the second option is best because it's far less painless, and the damage is so minor it's not worth the money to pay for a lawyer on my end.Finally, a situation where I say he pays me for it to be repaired and for my time, or I press charges, seems kind of like it could be turned on me like blackmail, and I know this man is very rich and likely has a lot of power relative to me so I don't want to get caught up.

9bawov	legaladvice	I'm in Canada, in Ontario, living in an apartment with a unique situation: the landlord company owns an apartment where their office is located. Half of the first floor is split between an apartment with three rooms (where I live) and the other half is the office. The second and third floors are also apartments that the landlord company owns.Here's the thing: The other tenants in the apartment, on the second and third floor, work for the landlord company. There is a door separating the office and the first-floor apartment, and directly across the hall from that is a door leading to the stairwell.  Over the last few months I've lived here, these employees have, on a regular basis:- Entered the first-floor apartment to use the bathroom- Entered the first-floor apartment to use the appliances in the kitchen (including the fridge to store their lunches and the microwave to heat up food -- of which the microwave is mine, not owned by the landlord)- Come through the apartment after work, as I imagine it's more convenient for them to walk through it to enter the stairwell, often making a ton of noise when they do soAdditionally, the lease stated that internet would be provided by the landlord, but the connection is often shaky at best, and the router is placed in the office, which means I can't interact with it when the office is closed if I'm having connection problems. I work from home, and need a solid connection to do so. I've asked if I could plug a LAN cable into the router but the landlord has refused. What can I do about these problems? Is it not safe to assume that the first-floor apartment, of which I'm renting a single room, can't be entered by the landlord company's employees without a 24h notice? I am unsure if there is a difference between renting a room, or renting an entire apartment space, and if this plays a part at all.Additionally, is the landlord allowed to prevent me from plugging a LAN cable into the router if they are providing the internet?

A little background, I am a physician who is currently working in a private practice in NYC. I am on contract to work a certain amount of years at this private practice. I have only been there for a few months.What's stressing me is that I want out of my contract. The owner of the practice is not a good doctor or person. Here is a small list of things that bother me about this practice.\- Aside from the injection needles, no other equipment used in the office is sterile (sterilized in the morning but the equipment is used throughout the day on all the patients)\- Owner's protocol for treating patients always includes over-treating, usually giving them treatments they do not need for problems they do not have\- Has assistants (not licensed medical assistants) in their office doing certain treatments they have not been licensed or trained to do, ex) Doing ""physical therapy"" on patients when they have no idea wtf they're doing\- Has security cameras and voice recording inside patient rooms, there is no consent given to these patients to allow this\- Again with treatment protocols, will sometimes do treatments that have a small chance of causing musculoskeletal issues with the patient, but they will document otherwise\- Has told me multiple times that they *""do NOT want the patient to get better""* they want the patient to continue to return over and over so they could keep billing them/their insurance\- The owner makes all the associates in the practice follow the protocols, which sucks. Recently I have stopped following them, and have begun to practice the right way. The owner will definitely freak out when they find out.No workers there are happy, its a miserable place to work at. The way the owner of this place practices medicine disgusts me, and I want out**My contract does NOT have a termination clause for me leaving.** There are only a few points on the contract discussing if he were to terminate me.I have spoken unofficially to a lawyer already, and he said that I would be able to use ""common law"" as my way out. He wants me to go up to the owner, list my issues, and then we would both sign a non-disclosure agreement.I am worried because I know coming up to the owner and telling him I'm quitting would cause this guy to really try to destroy my life.I am kinda new to all this, and extremely worried about my future if I were to quit.  My questions are\- Would I owe this guy any money if I left this way?\- Would he be able to sue me?\- Could he really destroy me?\- What are my options really?\- What would you do?Thank you guys in advance for the help.

9wez0l	legaladvice	My grandfather built a cabin in northern Arizona in the 60's. As a child in the 90's it was my favorite place in the world. To this day it is the single  most nostalgic place on earth for myself and my two brothers (and is very likely the sole piece of inheritance we will ever get from my family). In 2012 the cabin was getting to be too much of a burden on my (then 84 year old) grandmother. She deeded the cabin over to my aunt (who was the one taking care of the property at the time) and her husband. My grandmother has told me several times over the years that she did so on the condition that my aunt put myself and my two brothers (the only grandchildren she has) as heirs in her (my aunt's) will.Sadly my aunt passed away last year. Her husband (who originally was married to her sister until they ran away together) says he never heard anything about passing the cabin to us and suspiciously can't find any will. My grandmother (now 90) calls him and tells him that the cabin is for her grandchildren. He basically tells her to F-off and is now selling the cabin fully intent on keeping all the money to himself.Is there anything I can do to fight this legally?

I was also given copies of their credit cards for my own personal use.My dad, after having 0 interest in taking care of finances, decided he would look at some bank statements. He saw the transfers to my account and became infuriated. He forgot that he had given me a copy of his AmEx (card has my name on it and everything), my mom gave me copies of her Visas, and mostly these were used for things like groceries and gas. Luxuries I always made sure to use my own credit card.I get a furious text from my dad (whose mother died yesterday, and he’s very emotional) that what I’ve done is embezzlement.

The surveyors found that a 3x 3 foot area of neighbors driveway is on our property.Consulted a local real estate attorney recommended to us by the attorney who handled our wills. He recommended that we kindly approach new neighbors, discuss the situation, and ask them to sign a “permission of use” letter stating they have our permission to use the part of their driveway that is on our property.They refused! Mumbled something about a family member recommending they not sign it.Went back to our attorney who said “huh that is very strange. Nothing you can do now but take them to court, which could lead to hard feelings”.My main (only) concern is that we don’t want any trouble if we try to sell in a few years.

These landlords have been terrible throughout the duration of our time here, and I do not want to allow them to continue this sort of behavior to other tenants in the future.

ckoar3	legaladvice	To begin with, we reside in Mississippi.My husband and I have been separated for over two years now, and we share two children. I filed for a no-fault divorce not long after I moved out, and after agreeing to the terms of the divorce, my husband then decided to pull his agreement by saying that he did not have the papers adequately explained to him. (He declined to have an attorney.)This year, our relationship has become highly volatile. I was seriously injured in an argument a few months ago, and last month, he came to my place of work after threatening to find me and harm me. He was caught trying to sneak into my place of employment away from main entrances. This prompted me to file for a temporary ex parte domestic protection order, which was granted. The hearing for a final order of protection was continued twice due to scheduling conflicts with our respective attorneys. On Monday, he signed an agreement to the protection order, basically opting to stay away from the children and I so that he would not have to report to appropriate law enforcement, surrender his firearms, or be reported to NCIC. Yesterday, I was served with divorce papers. He is seeking full custody of the children, where I pay child support, every single expense related to the children, alimony, his car note, his mortgage, and basically all of his debt. He filed under fault grounds for desertion and cruel and inhuman treatment (???) Needless to say, I lost my marbles when I read the papers. My children are terrified of him and were so grateful that the protection order was granted, so the prospect of him even seeing them at this point is heartbreaking.We have an emergency hearing next week about these matters. I guess I need to know now if there is a risk that he could win, despite the DV protection order, despite the fact that he has never paid to support these children, and that he tried to get out of seeing them as often as he could.I am their mom, and I am terrified by the thought of losing them. I need reassurance while I wait to hear back from my lawyer.	EXPERT	Did he ever provide any?	<EXPERT_PCT_1_AUTHOR>	Did you talk to the police about it?	<EXPERT_PCT_0_AUTHOR>	real
d5eyzu	legaladvice	"I am located in California and am in my early thirties. Two years ago, my parents offered to help with a down payment on a house.  I agreed on the terms that there would be no strings attached.  The down payment came from a joint account that was shared between my mother and I. She put my name on it many years ago so there was no gift letter required from the bank when it came to using the funds for a down payment.Shortly after the purchase, my parents asked if they could use one of the spare bedrooms in my house as a ""crash pad."" My parents promised me they would only stay for short periods of time in between visiting family and traveling since they were retired.  I took their word for it and let them move in. In reality, they actually listed their house for rent and moved all their stuff into my house.  And they never left. After two years of endless drama and not getting along, I decided enough was enough.  I asked them to move out.  My parents own four homes on the east coast and have plenty of rental income from them as well as retirement income to sustain themselves so I didn't think this request would be an issue.  I thought they would just honor our agreement and leave.However they refused.  They have gone full rage mode and now call me ungrateful and that they have every right to live in the house.  They stated that since they gave me money for the down payment, my house was theirs to live in and use as they want.  The thing is, they do not pay any bills and their names are not on the mortgage or title of the house.  I have told them that I will go through legal eviction if they do not leave since at this point I have had enough.  I argued that the down payment was a gift with no strings attached but have threatened to sue me to get back their money.  My father has stated that he will keep suing me in court until I go bankrupt if I do not give them back their money.  Do they have any legal leg to stand on?  I have never had anything involving the courts or lawyers and have no idea on what to do now.  Can I be sued and forced to give back the down payment? Thank you for your help in advance."

Today, those same tenants are still renting out the same floor. Sheriffs showed up at our door today looking for Ed, who has been MIA since he went bankrupt a long time ago. It seems the lawyer he worked with back then created this fake deed for my home under Ed's name, and that lawyer claims that Ed handed him the deed as payment since Ed went bankrupt. The sheriffs are looking for Ed to confirm this is his home. However, they also stated that Ed's lawyer already went ahead to a civil court and had a judge there approve the deed. The sheriffs said once they find Ed, a letter will be sent out to me, and then within 90 days of that letter sent, I have to go to court and show the judge my real deed under my name.So I currently have so many questions. Is there anything I can do at this point? I'm not even sure where to start. I can look for a damn good lawyer, who my tenant said they would pay for. But am I supposed to wait for that letter before going to court? Where can I see that this deed was transferred to Ed's name? Where can I find out which judge made this bs approval?

eb2rq2	legaladvice	Posted my car up for sale in Oklahoma. Keep in mind I have a full inspection done at a dealership last month showing the vehicle passing with flying colors all around. I proceeded to sell the vehicle to a lady and she wired the money through PayPal via ex boyfriend that owed her money. She test drove it before we did anything and she loved it and drove it again to drop me off at work since I don't have a car. We signed papers and we went out separate ways. We signed a notarized bill of sale and she signed a copy of the bill of sale and I kept the copy. Proceeds to txt me the next day and call me saying the car is acting funny and that she is stranded at a parking lot. I said I never had any issues with it before I'm sorry. She said I need to take a look at the car and that this isn't going to work if it's not running. Out of curiosity I checked out the car and it's ruined! The serpentine belt is chewed up, sucked up in the radiator can, tore up the internals and it's all messed up. I took pictures and a video. I wish I took pictures of the inside of the vehicle that had an empty box of liquor and on open can by the driver seat of something I didn't know what it was. I told her this car is ruined and I told her it's under her ownership. Know she has requested a refund through PayPal after the money is already on my bank account. She is also threatening me saying if I want to keep my job etc, and she knows people, she knows attorneys, and that I need to give her a refund or I will drown in lawyer fees and lawsuits. Can anyone please help! I cannot afford a lawyer or anything like that. What I do have is picture of the notarized bill of sale.

bqawiw	legaladvice	"Hi,I have a Rottweiler cross, he's well behaved but skittish (rescue dog from a bad home). I live alone and have no children, and aside from my brother and girlfriend nobody comes over, so my dog is accustomed to us three and behaves well. I wouldn't trust him around children, and always ensure the fence in our backyard is well secured. The rare time he leaves the property with me, he is muzzled.Three weeks ago, he was stolen from my backyard while I was at work. The gate was clearly broken from the outside. About a week later I found him milling around my house and was glad to have him back.From what I have pieced together, someone came and took him, and at some point left him alone with a child, whom he attacked fairly badly. They must have simply shooed him out of their house, and he found his way back to me. The parent has sent me a letter demanding a very high payment, and I've also spoken to the police and animal control, who want to seize the dog. I lied and said he never returned.I have a large property and an upper middle class lifestyle, while the claimant is some welfare bum. He's being coy about how my dog ended up at his place (apparently told the police a ""friend"" sold it to him for $50), but frankly even if he admitted the theft, he'd probably do a month or two in jail, and then get a six figure payout from me.Do I have any legal defense here?

ctvpr0	legaladvice	Posting for my brother. He lives in Texas. Recently, he was involved in an accident and the insurance company declared his vehicle (2007 Lincoln Navigator L Ultimate) a total loss. In case it matters, he was hit by another drive, but because the other driver lied to police, the police listed my brother at fault.Based on NADA/KBB/local comps, his vehicle was worth between $10,000 - $11,000, but the insurance company is only offering him $7,100. They’re using non-L (L is the designation for physically longer versions; he has 6 kids and can’t fit everyone in the standard size SUV) versions of his vehicle with fewer options as the basis for their valuation.After my brother emailed the adjuster back with the details that his vehicle is an L version, and a laundry list of options that his Navigator had that the insurance company’s comps did not have, they insist that the payout for his total is $7,100. One of the reasons they cite is that the payout is “the lesser” of either 1) what it costs to repair the vehicle or 2) what it costs to replace it. It would cost less to repair, so they insist they can only give him the repair amount.I know insurance companies are highly regulated, but he’s getting nowhere at this point.

c8o0w8	legaladvice	This morning, I went to meet a client that that I’ve been talking to for a few days. The son was 8 years old. He was very quiet and was messily eating his breakfast. He didn’t speak a word to me and I thought he was very shy. The mom just told me that I would have to look after the house and feed him. And she told me the hours I had to work and I gave an hourly rate. She was doing a tour of everything and showed me his room. When I was in there I noticed a box of diapers in the corner, one diaper on the dresser and a box of wipes. I got a little concerned and asked her about it. I thought she would just say the diaper is only because of nightly bed wetting. Turns out her son has autism, he is not really verbal and not potty trained. I told her that I charge more when I have to give that much care. She got angry and said she was going to report me to the website. And that it’s illegal and discriminatory to charge her more for her sons disability. My usual rate is cheaper than most. I only do older children that I basically just have to be in the room with. I do homework and study for classes for majority of the time. I’ve only had like 4-5 special needs clients and they required more care so I charge more. The other parents were upfront about the child’s needs and what my duties were (diapers, hitting, spitting, bitting, cleanups, constant monitoring)  She never mentioned her son being special needs since we’ve been talking that’s why I told her the cheaper price.She also threatened to report me to the board of nursing, even though I didn’t get hired as a CNA. I recently got my CNA, the only reason she even knows about it is because this morning as we were chatting over coffee, she had asked me about my life/college/nursing major. I just mentioned it.Is what I did illegal? Can I be reported for something that doesn’t have anything to do with my CNA? She is furious and I don’t doubt she’ll make as big of a fuss as she can, what can I do?

b0k3gp	legaladvice	Sorry this is a bit vague but I want to be really careful, so if you need more detail add a comme t and I'll fill in the gaps as best I can.Short version is I work with a guy and have never gotten along with him, but we are usually both professional. He is in a superior position to me and about a month ago we had a clash about something to do with work. Both of us blame the other person for what happened and our bosses are trying to do an internal investigation about it.In the meantime, he has gone and sent a formal report to the governing body that handles my registration for this job. It's a big bloody deal, and this kind of thing destroys jobs. I've just gotten a copy of the report and have less than a month to respond to it before the official investigation into my professional conduct. I have a good union and they provide a free lawyer to support me in my response, so all good there. I feel pretty confident that after it's all done I will be fine, but it's pretty damn stressful to go through regardless.So one thing is that his report is 10 pages, mostly defending himself but quite a bit calling me dangerous, insane, arrogant etc, and demanding that I be stood down immediately. None of which is helpful for the investigation, but whatever. He has also contradicted himself a few times in his report, which obviously helps my case. My question is, when it's all over can I sue him for defamation and creating a false report? Or something along those lines?Edit sorry bot told me I've got to have my location, I'm in Australia.Edit: also didn't know PMs werent allowed sorry. I've taken that bit out.

Thank you for your time. .Post: I bought a used Toyota with Washington state plates in a panic when when my Honda got totalled Easter night and I depleted my savings after paying for the car and replacement engine parts, I got hit simultaneously with child support and arrears (in NY state) and saving money has been the most difficult task since that happened and I couldn't afford to register the vehicle in my name.I finally have like, $600 to work with now since then.It's still not registered under my name, and I've been riding out the license plate stickers (they expire 02/2020) and working grubhub to earn and save up money. I have plans of driving this vehicle to NY because I'll be moving there before the end of this year. The engine light is on and I want to get that taken care of as well. My question(s) is this; Would it be in my best interest to register it here in Oregon from Washington before my move, or wait until I get to New York to register is from Washington? Since I waited so long to register, will I be penalized in either state when I register?If I am to be penalized, would selling this current car and start new with a new (used) car/registration be an option? Is the car technically even mine to sell? What would be my best course of action to get to NY without suffering financially?I need a vehicle when I get there so I can find fulltime work immediately to keep up with the support and arrears payments because I need my daughter to continue being taken care of financially.  My kid is in NY and I need to be closer to her, that's why I'm going through this. Help?

92qios	legaladvice	A few weeks ago, my family ordered dinner from our local pizza shop and my father went to go pick it up. While paying for the pizza and engaging in some conversation with the cashier, there was a woman at the cashier next to him also paying for her food. She had her phone and wallet out on the counter. My dad got our pizza and collected his things, and accidentally took the woman’s phone off of the counter and put it in his pocket, mistakenly thinking it was his phone. According to my dad, he said the woman saw in full view what he was doing, and said nothing. About a half hour later, a police officer comes knocking on our door. The officer stated that a woman from the pizza shop was missing her phone, and the find my iPhone app tracked it to our house. My dad looked in his pocket and saw that he had the phone they were looking for, along with his actual phone. He realized his mistake, apologized profusely, and gave the phone back to the officer. He explained that it was an honest mistake and he never meant to steal anything from the woman. The officer seemed to understand (even laughed a little bit), took the phone, and returned it to the woman. Today, my dad received a court ordered letter stating that the woman intends to press charges of theft by unlawful taking. The letter states that my dad willfully and  unlawfully took the woman’s property with no intention of returning it to the woman, and intended to sell the stolen property. The letter states that if he is found guilty he could face a fine, community service, or even jail time. This was 100% an honest mistake. My dad is an old man who has never stolen anything in his life and has no criminal record. The two phones were the same model and both have black cases.

cw3ihi	legaladvice	Hello all,Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this post. I am losing sleep over this issues and it's all I've been able to thing about. The past 3 months I have received huge electric bills for my one bedroom apartment in NJ. They have averaged a daily use of about 52 kWh over the course of three months. At my previous apartment over the course of 16 months my average usage was about 9 kWh, 12 kWh when only looking at summer months. I have tried everything to reduce my usage (no AC, everything on power strips, even unplugging power strips and appliances when not in use) and I still am having astronomically high usage. I have worked with the utility company, PSEG, to have my meter replaced and checked to see if it is faulty. Already since it was replaced 21 hours ago I am at 30 kWh. PSEG representatives also checked the apartment's usage history and found high electric usage in the winter which is uncommon with gas heating and suggested I may be carrying a foreign load. My landlord and I both have acknowledged that since the meter is not wrong, it is likely something else, but who is responsible for finding out what it is? In my mind, my issue is now between me and my landlord as opposed to the utility company and it is on her to prove to me that there is nothing wrong with the wiring of the building she owns. There are a total of 8 units at my address and I am worried that I am being charged for a foreign load from some of the other units. My landlord informed me of the high meter usage, but that was it, there was no help offered to figure out the. issue. In a few days I will be getting another 200+ dollar utility bill and my emergency fund is running out because I am paying so much money every month for these electric bills. What should my next steps be? Should I be putting pressure on my landlord to hire an electrician? Am I stuck paying 300 dollars a month for the remainder of my lease? Is there any way to get my money back if it is proven there is a wiring issue? Thanks in advance. Add: I do not have access to my meter or breaker box so whenever I want to check on things she has to unlock the door to that room.

8r0vk9	legaladvice	I just discovered that my mother has lied about her age for her whole life. According to her passport and her license, she is 53 years old. Biologically, she is 41 years old.My late maternal grandmother also lied about her age to the government her whole life, saying she was born in 1939 when she was really born in 1949. She used to receive pension and disability.My grandmother came from Saigon and told the govt that my mother was born in Saigon during the war in '65, but she was really born in '77... after the war.. (my Australian grandfather went along with this before he died). My mother won't tell me where she was really born, most likely because she doesn't know or remember because her mother lied to her and told her to lie.My mother just revealed to me her real age because she is updating her passport and thinking of changing it to her real age (along with license and everything else that has her fake date of birth). She is deciding between keeping her fake age or adopting her biological age, to which she would apply for pension 12 years before she was really born if she decided to remain fake.She looks late 30s / early 40s in appearance, which can be possible for someone in their early 50's.. it's not like she would be applying for a pension while looking 20 years old.I just want to know: if my mum updated her details to her real age now, would she be in trouble with the law for age fabricating for the past 20\-30 years? If she decided to keep her fake age and eventually apply for pension, would there be any way for the govt to find out her real age? And if so, how would she be in trouble with the law?The DNA that my mum has potentially been given away to the govt that I know of was through blood tests and blood donations if that's even possible. She said that apparently the australian passport office told her that she is 41 online????? She been very delusional about everything throughout my life so I take that with a grain of salt.. she also said the govt could somehow get her DNA by skin\-scratching or sex??????P.S: She told me that if she kept lying about her age, that, when she dies they will DNA test her and see that she is really 12 years younger than she is.. and that will somehow affect her inheritance coming to me and my brother even if she has a will. Because apparently she had to show two of my grandmother's IDs (one born in '39 and the other born in '49) in order to receive her mother's inheritance. Is this true????TL;DR: My mother is contemplating correcting her real age which she lied about for the past 20\-30 years, will she get in trouble? Can the govt also determine her real age somehow if she doesn't truthfully come out?? Would this affect inheritance???

c46b7n	legaladvice	Asking for some help for a friend. Is there a case here? I feel like there is but really need some advice first. Shes ready and wants to peruse this. I went with my friend to an orthopedic specialist at a well credited hospital for an arthritic problem in her hand. The doctor prescribed her oral steroid tablets as they were the least invasive solution to her problem. He told us about the oral steroid tablets, as well as 2 other methods to solving her hand issue - steroid injection shot or surgery, but he did not disclose anything else, including side effects. Fast forward 1 week, she finishes the dospak of oral steroid tablets, and two days later, she suffers severe side effects - one of which is a major mental health status change i.e. she becomes suicidal. Having never had this issue before, and using common sense and finding research on the side effects, she calls the doctor and asks to confirm that this is just a bad reaction to what he's prescribed. As he is too busy to talk to her himself, his secretary tells her on his behalf via voicemail that it's “absolutely” not the meds, therefore it's not their problem and she should contact her pcp. So now she has a recorded message of her medical professional claiming that her mental health change is not from what they've given her. She talks to co workers and other medical professionals who tell her it’s the steroids and she needs to go to the ER for immediate attention. Having been in a medical profession herself, she goes to the ER thinking they have some sort of banana bag or IV solution to flush the meds out of her system. As having no experience with side effects like this before, we didn't know what to expect, therefore it comes to us as a suprise when she gets pink slipped and sent to a psychiatric ward for a 72 hour hold as is this is the state of Ohio's protocol when someone comes in with thoughts of self harm. We disclosed all the information we could think of to the best of our knowledge to the hospital, clarifying that it was the side effects and they pink slipped her anyways. Other medical professionals since then have told her that it was the medication that caused the side effects, and any doctor should know that, as well as carefully disclose them. So now we are dealing with hospital bills and confused and hurt family members all because of what we feel is the fault of a rude and careless doctor and his secretary. Do we have a valid case here?

afypod	legaladvice	For a bit of background: My husband was a naval aviator and then a commercial airline pilot. Due to some health concerns (high risk pregnancy for me, our resulting newborn, and a heart condition on his end) he decided to start looking for a different career. As his background is in engineering, he found a phenomenal job in his field as a private contractor for the Federal Government.  This of course means all of the background checks, etc., to allow him clearance and access into the place is he’ll need to go to perform his job.This is where things get tricky. A couple of months ago, my husband stopped into thegrocery store to pick up some onions.  For some reason, our debit card wouldn’t go through. More than likely he just entered an incorrect pin, but regardless he texted me to make sure I had transferred money into that account. I stated I had, but by the time I replied he said he had already put the onions back and left the store.A couple of weeks later he received a call from the local police department. The store had reported him for shoplifting. The officer stated that they had my husband on camera. This was very baffling, as my husband said he clearly walked the bag of onions back to the produce section and replaced them. The officer replied that it wasn’t the onions, but when my husband walked from the checkout stand to the produce department he had something red in his hand, and when he left the store he no longer had that in his hand. Guys, our debit card is a bright red Wells Fargo card. My husband informed the officer of that, and asked what they thought of the red object was, exactly? The officer couldn’t answer that, but advised my husband and the store had looked in other areas of the store where he had shopped and it appeared that a box he had been looking at had also been opened so it must have been one of the things from the box. My husband asked what was inside this box that was red and the officer did not know. Regardless of the store not actually being able to say what they think my husband took, the officer issued him a citation and gave him an optional court date for the 28th of this month. As a result, my husband has had to leave his temporary-pending-clearance role at his job until he goes to court and the charge is either dismissed or he is found innocent.This was over a week ago now, and even after the court date it’s possible that it will take him several more weeks to get his clearance back. The salary for his position breaks down to nearly $60 an hour, and even under the best of circumstances he will be out a month’s wages at that rate.First of all, what is the best way for us to approach this shoplifting charge? Anyone who knows my husband knows it’s completely bogus, and frankly it doesn’t sound like the store has anything other than paranoia and some poor video driving their case.Second, is there any way to go after the store for lost wages? After our myriad of health issues all hitting at practically one time, our family really needed this money. It’s in credulous to me that a business could throw out such a flaky accusations and a literally cost a family thousands upon thousands of dollars to deal with it.**TLDR**:  my husband was accused of shoplifting by a local grocery store, after their security footage caught him carrying out his own debit card and they thought it was a product from inside the store. Due to the pending charge and court date, my husband cannot work at his position which requires he have a federal security clearance. First of all, how do we deal with this flimsy charge? And second, is there a way to go after the store for what will turn out to be over a month of lost wages?

b0w2u9	legaladvice	"I'm sorry this is on mobile on a burner account and I'm probably going to crosspost on r/confessions I just feel like I need some ears and advice legal and non. So here it goes...As a bit of background I am a 16yo high school student in Utah (a junior in high school). Last trimester my family made me go on a 2 week long vacation to Disneyland I had never been on a vacation before so they made me go, it was fine but when I got back I immediately caught pneumonia and was in bed for over a week. After getting back I was drowning in homework and was more stressed than I had ever been in my life. I was constantly depressed and exhausted from all the work and despite it all I still had F's in my all my classes and the end of the tri was coming up. I ended up voicing this stress to a co-worker at the pizza place I worked at and he ended up telling me that he could get me some ""stuff"" (weed) to help me be less stressed for 90$ I had tried smokin it once and enjoyed it so I agreed. About a week later he showed up with a dab vape pen and 2 marijuana chocolate bars which I took and hid in my nightstand. I tried the dab once (didn't really like it so I was going to give it back) and I started taking the chocolate a little bit at a time before bed for a couple nights because I noticed it helped me sleep and cope with the stress. Fast forward to about a week after getting it.  I borrowed my moms phone because mine broke and I needed to respond to some important emails. I did so, but my mom took the phone back before I had a chance to sign out I made her promise to do so but she never did. Apparently she went through all my emails and Hangouts and found an email linked to my normal Reddit account where she browsed through it and found a post I made on r/exmormon (I was a closeted ex mormon) where I mentioned using weed once before in a comment. She freaked out and went through my drawers and found the supplies and immediately called the cops before even talking to me.I came home after school one day to find a police officer waiting for me. I go inside and he tells me that I committed a class A felony and that I would be going to juvenile court where I would be punished. Yesterday I finally got a letter that set up a meeting with a parole officer where my punishment would be decided. I am just panicking because I have plans to move to Texas this summer for a sales job (already signed a contract) on my own. I am just terrified that I won't be able to do this or that I won't be able to sleep at my friend's house on weekends and I'm worried that it will hurt my chance of getting into college and I just don't know what to do. I have never gotten so much as a speeding ticket and I have never had a drop of alchohol, and I just feel so stupid for trying to cope with the stress that way. Any advice for what I can expect or what I need to do would be amazing because I am panicking right now. I'm sorry for the rant. TL/DR: I was a dumbass and got caught using weed to cope with stress."

9y85im	legaladvice	I and a friend of mine bought a rank(MVP+) on a server from a video game called Unturned. However, a couple months later, the server shut down. This week the server started up again and are bringing back ranks. Now as the ranks are being added to the server, the owner changed the ranks drastically removing benefits such as kits and commands even though when we bought the ranks it was clearly saying that the ranks were permanent. He is also adding those removed benefits to new ranks that costs more money.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/YD5xvo3](https://imgur.com/gallery/YD5xvo3)  As you can see, it says that the ranks given will not be removed, which is a promise the owner did NOT keep.  As we're writing this today, the owner has just told us that he is entitled to make changes to the ranks.  As I've said, however, these changes aren't minor. He removed massive perks such as the ability to spawn in a vehicle every 20 minutes or so, and about 10 other kits that played a huge role within the game.  The main problem for us is that we can't actually click on the terms and conditions, as the picture is from a website that lets you view other websites from the past, so we can't actually see what the terms were.  **Is there any way for us to get back what we paid for? Is it potentially possible to file a lawsuit? We're not from the UK, but we know the owner is, and that the server is there.** TL;DR: we bought ranks on a video game server, server shut down, the server came back up again, we still had ranks, but the owner removed like 80% of the benefits.

bbn4jt	legaladvice	I own property in Kentucky. When I moved out of state I rented the property. After some time, my grandfather died and my step-grandmother wanted to move into town. She doesn't drive and wanted close access to banks, church, grocery stores, etc.She has always liked my house, and wanted to live there. She cashed in her retirement fund, and agreed that she wanted to move into my house, but she didn't want to pay rent. She wanted to live there permanently. I offered to sell the house to her, but she could not afford market value for the home. So, I compromised and offered to let her live there for the rest of her life if she would pay the balance of my mortgage.She agreed to pay the lesser amount for rights to live there. So, she gave me a check for $26,000. The balance on my mortgage was around $24,000, so I had a small cash profit from the transaction.As part of our agreement she was to maintain the home and repairs, and pay one half of the taxes and insurance. I would pay the remaining half.This was an entirely verbal agreement (I know, I know). However, in the state of KY verbal contracts are binding to the best of my knowledge, although difficult to defend.Now to the meat of the story. My grandmother has a niece who claims she has been assigned POA. This lady has been messaging me on Facebook and making demands. She has also threatened to retain a lawyer.This lady pointed out that my 2018 property taxes are delinquent. I absolutely Am going to pay them. However, the lady also states that I need to make major repairs to the house and that it is falling apart. She is accusing me of taking advantage of the elderly because the deed to the house is still in my name.So, I am debating what I should do that would be legally my right or responsibility. Do I HAVE to deal with this woman who claims POA? I am not in a position to make any repairs to the home. My grandmother was supposed to assume responsibility for that, and the home was in GOOD condition when she moved in. So, any repairs would be from neglect or damage.I am not convinced that I owe my grandmother $26000 either. She has lived in the home two years. Fair market value for my home for rent is $500-$550 per month.We did not have landlord/tenant arrangements, as this is more of a verbal life estate agreement. So, can I revert this to a more standard landlord agreement since she wants to terminate the life estate agreement? Can I say, well, you have lived here for two years, and in that time rents would have been $12000-$13200, so I can reimburse your $26000 minus rent? Can I retain any extra as a penalty for terminating the agreement?This is all over the place, and a hot mess. I need advise on what to do. Right now my options are to either buy her out for an unspecified amount, or to give her the deed for less than market value. If I do the buy out I will have to take a loan. If I do the deed I will lose money on the house.What advise do you have?

bggtzr	legaladvice	My roommate and I are living in Boston right next to the BU campus (less than a minute walk), and one of our neighbors is an old couple that made noise complaints on us. The couple called the police on us one night and that's the reason we're being evicted. We got an eviction to leave in 7 days during finals week so we can't really focus on moving out and dealing with this properly. We lived in another apartment building that was owned by the same landlord for a year and never got a noise complaint before. The loudest we ever got was us talking in Arabic with our friends in the weekends, but the eviction states that we shout, yell and bang on the walls, when in reality the old couple bangs on our walls whenever they thought were being loud. We never play loud music, we never have parties. We asked the people living right under us if we were being loud and they never complained.

awu26a	legaladvice	Hello... was wondering if someone could shed some light on my situation. About 3 months ago I received two job offers and I accepted one job and turned down the second job offer. I even advised the agency that helped me get the job offer that I would be declining it. Fast forward three months into my current job, I get a call from the company I turned down saying they've been paying me even though I'm not even working there and that I owe them over $7000. I should have kept a closer eye on my bank account, but now I know for sure going forward so I won't ever be in a situation like this ever again. I'm not exactly sure what to do.

I'm desperate and fearing for my safety (my mom is not taking this as seriously as I am).They've been married roughly ten years but separated for I'd say about one. Since then, he has become very financially abusive. He's threatened to kick us out of our place ***at least*** three times and turn off our cell phones more than that. My mom said he has always spied on her (early in their relationship he used to tape record her in the car) but since his name is on the phone bill account, he was able to go through the numbers my mom has called and ask them what their relationship is to her. She says she's caught him stalking her (no pictures of this) multiple times since he moved out. One time during an argument he told me to my face that my mom is a lying bitch and has instigated fights with her in front of my little sister whom he is the father of even though my mom tried to walk away. There are many different instances (he gave my mom a black eye once during a mutual altercation) I can go into but I'm trying to stay as vague as possible for fear of this backfiring on my mom and her case in any way. I don't think they've begun the formal divorce process. He also has a card to posses a firearm. The last time I checked, he has one in his possession however my mom says otherwise.Today, however, my mom confronted him about some precarious information she found about him and he has called me over 18 times, sent me a threatening text to once again cut off our phones (he uses the words ""tell her to stop playing with me"" though which scared me to no end), and has been stalking around our house for three hours now.

To this day it is the single  most nostalgic place on earth for myself and my two brothers (and is very likely the sole piece of inheritance we will ever get from my family). In 2012 the cabin was getting to be too much of a burden on my (then 84 year old) grandmother. She deeded the cabin over to my aunt (who was the one taking care of the property at the time) and her husband. My grandmother has told me several times over the years that she did so on the condition that my aunt put myself and my two brothers (the only grandchildren she has) as heirs in her (my aunt's) will.Sadly my aunt passed away last year. Her husband (who originally was married to her sister until they ran away together) says he never heard anything about passing the cabin to us and suspiciously can't find any will. My grandmother (now 90) calls him and tells him that the cabin is for her grandchildren.

8xde1u	legaladvice	I was fired on Friday July 7th at noon and am seeing tons of red flags. Wondering what, if anything, can be, or should be done in this situation. On the morning of June 29th, after 102 days of employment, I received an invitation to go over a 90-day review, for that very same afternoon. I believe this review was prompted by my submission of sign-up paperwork for health benefits on June 19th, which I was eligible for after 90 days. My employment contract states that I would receive a 120 day review, so I was shocked to be receiving a review after the 90-day and not the 120-day mark. The review meeting consisted of myself, the owner, and the agency manager who is my “partner/co-manager.” The notes I was given during this review were completely blindsiding. I had no inkling up to this point that I was doing anything less than a great job. I had even written an email to the owner after six weeks, asking for feedback and never received a response. The 90-day review meeting consisted of an hour and a half of me defending myself, being held accountable for things I was never taught or trained on, or expected to do based on my job description and I was told I wasn’t motivated because I didn’t feel comfortable creating reports and writing minutes for meetings that should have taken place prior to my employment (which I ultimately did do, and had completed prior to the review meeting). At the end of the meeting, the owner asked me to give him a reason to tear up the review document. I again felt the need to defend myself, I showed him the page of notes that I had taken on changes, improvements, and necessary follow-up to be done going forward. The owner was satisfied and tore up the review, stating we would all start fresh on Monday. As the meeting concluded just after 5:00pm on Friday, June 29th, I placed my notebook on my desk, and left the issues to be followed up on after the weekend. The following week I worked Monday and Tuesday, making strides and efforts to address items on my page of notes from the meeting, while continuing on with my regular job duties. Wednesday was a Holiday, Thursday I was absent for a family emergency, and returned to the office on Friday. I sent a group text message to the owner and agency manager on Thursday stating I would not be in, as I had to leave town, but I would be back late that night and in the office on Friday. I received a separate text from the agency manager asking if everything was okay, but never heard back from the owner. When I returned to work on Friday morning, things seemed normal. At about 11:30am, the agency manager stated that the owner wanted to meet with us to go over some things. I again met with them, where the previously torn up 90 day review was reprinted and sitting on the table. The owner asked what had happened that I needed a day off, I told him I had a grandparent pass away. He said he was sorry to hear that, and then asked why I didn’t text him back the day before (the day I was out). I stated I didn’t receive a response, and that he could look at my phone to verify this. I told him that I thought it was odd that he didn’t reply, but that I didn’t think too much of it. He clearly did not believe that I didn’t receive his message, but continued on with the meeting. He went on to generalize that I hadn’t made improvements since our last meeting (less than a week ago), and I said that I didn’t know what drastic improvements he was expecting over 2.5 days of work, but that I did make efforts from the list of notes. The owner went back through my review, underlining at random what the true issues were with my performance, when he handed the paperwork back to me, I addressed each underlined item individually, but it was clear that I would never be in the right. After a few minutes of the owner staring at me in silence, he stated that integrity was important to him and that it just wouldn’t work for me to continue to work there. I stated that integrity was important to me also, said good luck, and asked when I would receive my final paycheck. He stated that he had 48 hours to get it to me, and that I would receive it via direct deposit. I walked back to my office, and  gathered my belongings as the owner stood silently at my desk to ensure I didn’t touch the company computer, and was out the door at noon. That evening I had the following text message exchange with the owner. 4:40pm Owner: Did you leave your office key6:57pm Owner: No response?? You are no longer allowed on Beo/RMMM property.7:07pm Me: Couldn’t respond immediately. Still didn’t get your text from yesterday. I have my key still. I can’t drop if off if I’m not allowed on property.7:07pm Owner: Give it to Ryan (my boyfriend who works for a separate company in the same building, under the same owner)7:07pm Me: I’ll mail it. 7:08pm Owner: Fair. 7:09pm Onwer: Be careful of the lies you attempt to spread. I don’t take your slander lightly7:10pm Me: Not to worry.7:11pm Owner: I’m not, but you should be. My continuing concerns are as follows:Benefits - Were they ever processed? I should have had coverage effective July 1st but have not received any info or a pay stub to confirm a deduction.Final pay - My final pay should have been issued to me immediately upon termination. https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/final-payDocumentation - I didn’t receive a copy of the 90 day review as it was “torn up” at the end of the meeting. I was given no termination paperwork or copies of the review, nor was I asked to sign anything. Wrongful termination - ???Personal Property - I purchased an organizer for my office that cost $25, I also left two baskets in my office that I paid for personally and cost $25 combined.

9bawov	legaladvice	I'm in Canada, in Ontario, living in an apartment with a unique situation: the landlord company owns an apartment where their office is located. Half of the first floor is split between an apartment with three rooms (where I live) and the other half is the office. The second and third floors are also apartments that the landlord company owns.Here's the thing: The other tenants in the apartment, on the second and third floor, work for the landlord company. There is a door separating the office and the first-floor apartment, and directly across the hall from that is a door leading to the stairwell.  Over the last few months I've lived here, these employees have, on a regular basis:- Entered the first-floor apartment to use the bathroom- Entered the first-floor apartment to use the appliances in the kitchen (including the fridge to store their lunches and the microwave to heat up food -- of which the microwave is mine, not owned by the landlord)- Come through the apartment after work, as I imagine it's more convenient for them to walk through it to enter the stairwell, often making a ton of noise when they do soAdditionally, the lease stated that internet would be provided by the landlord, but the connection is often shaky at best, and the router is placed in the office, which means I can't interact with it when the office is closed if I'm having connection problems. I work from home, and need a solid connection to do so. I've asked if I could plug a LAN cable into the router but the landlord has refused. What can I do about these problems? Is it not safe to assume that the first-floor apartment, of which I'm renting a single room, can't be entered by the landlord company's employees without a 24h notice? I am unsure if there is a difference between renting a room, or renting an entire apartment space, and if this plays a part at all.Additionally, is the landlord allowed to prevent me from plugging a LAN cable into the router if they are providing the internet?

ei5na7	legaladvice	Hi, this happened in Atlanta, GA and the accident happened about a month ago. I was the victim in a hit and run situation. The damages to my car are around $600-800 but the dealership said it would take about 2 weeks to fix and I do not have rental coverage on my insurance. I cannot afford to be without my car for 2 weeks. Since my deductible on my insurance is $1000, my insurance company is not paying anything so they suggested I directly go through the culprit's insurance. Not only would I not have to pay anything out of pocket, but the culprit's insurance can provide a rental car as well while my car is being fixed.I have the license plate number and witness and police report as well. I even have a dashcam video but I haven't told anyone about it since I wan't sure if dashcam video is allowed as evidence. The culprit's insurance policy just declined saying there isn't enough evidence and that the culprit is not responding to their contact attempts. Hit and run I believe is a criminal offense so I don't understand how the culprit not responding is even a valid excuse for denying my case. Also what do they mean by not enough evidence, what more can a person do in a hit and run other than getting the licence plate number, police report and witness?Should I go with a lawyer for this?

9qpk63	legaladvice	Keeping it short, a leading medical institution recently charged $201,000 for an infusion of a new-on-the-scene drug for my MS. BOTH Medicare and my insurer have now declined covering any of the cost.  I'm anticipating a bill for the $201,000 any day now. To say I'm about to shit in my pants is an understatement. I thought I had done everything right. I'll certainly be appealing the insurance declines. In the meantime, I'm trying to figure out if I have any legal recourse if the appeals fail. Any suggestions here are most appreciated.The problems that perhaps have legal recourse that I see are:1. Gross overcharging. .... With a different medical group I got the exact same  infusion 6 months ago at a much lower cost of $65,000, the typical charge. How can my new medical institution charge over 3 times as much? I was not given any advance notice on what the charge would be. Nor was I given choices of where to have the infusion. Instead, my MS doc simply had me go to their institution's  infusion center for my treatment. This high charge is so extreme (and so not disclosed in advance) that it seems like fraud to me. 2. Arbitrary change in policy by insurer. ... I've had the same insurer for several years. Six months ago they covered my first time infusion. They've now changed course.3. Class action suit ... Expanding on item one above, I'm sure this leading institution grossly overcharges others. I suppose that's the way the system is allowed to work. But that's insane. By analogy, what if I went to a restaurant and was given a menu with no prices. Then when the bill came it was for $1,000? Bullshit on that.For what it matters, I changed my medical institution because I recently moved.Finally, the new drug has been totally worthless in helping me. In fact, as best I can tell, my symptoms have gotten worse.  Even if the drug were free I'd now be discontinuing the drug's use given the increased risk of cancer the drug gives you.

9yrk4g	legaladvice	Location: NJ, USAHi, everyone. I recently made a few orders online at this outerwear company because they were having some crazy deals. The company is well known and popular. I used the browser extension Honey, which automatically applies coupon codes to your cart. I ended up getting items at around 10% of the retail price. I took screenshots of my receipts after ordering online just in case. I was originally charged on my credit card the amount that the receipt showed, which was the amount I agreed to pay. A few days later, the items were confirmed and shipped. In that shipping email, however, the price was different from what the website had shown me and what my screenshots show. I had a few orders, and each order had a different price increase, so it doesn’t really make sense. One of my orders went from $7 to $20, and another went from $40 to $500. At first, my credit card still had the pending charges of the original price, but when I checked this morning, they had posted higher. What should I do here? If I call the company and argue that since I have screenshots of my orders clearly showing the lower prices, should I be reimbursed? Will screenshots hold up? Can I call the bank and dispute it?Tldr: bought items online for a great deal, took screenshots of receipts on website. Was shipped those items, but then charged more than what I agreed to pay.

9zyngm	legaladvice	Hello r/legaladvice,&amp;#x200B;I'm here because I have a problem: I am the legal co-owner of my house (with my sister). Some time ago I took a tenant in the second floor. He was chosen by me and the public service \[CPAS\] which are the one who came to me to propose me to take a tenant in my house, since it's a big one and I live alone. Everything went fine, I never had problems with him, he is physically disabled at 66%.&amp;#x200B;However, since a short time (a month, a month and a half) he has become really violent. He hit me (I have a written record from my doctor), he destroyed my door, he has serious problems with alcohol. But he was the first to contact the police. I cannot file a complaint right now , in fact, I have been verbally told Thursday the 22th that I had to leave my house by Tuesday 27th. They will come with a truck and a bailiff to take note of my leaving. I am being evicted of my own house! It seems that the police and the bourgmestre /mayor are on his side - maybe because they know each other (it's a little town) maybe because he's heavy disabled. I have been told to send him a letter ONCE I'm out of my own house to ask him to leave, with a 6 month notice.The police will come tuesday, and I actually don't feel safe in my own house. While this man is disabled, he's really strong ; I'm also afraid that if I quit my house for whatever reason I need to go out  the police and him will just lock me out in advance.

The apartment was advertised as being cat friendly. There is a non-approved pet fee of $500.Am I screwed here?

93gycl	legaladvice	I am currently enrolled in a summer class at a small state school here in the state of Kansas. It's a sociology course, and we had a class earlier this week that was in regards to hate speech. We frequently have similar conversations where students are able to express their opinions on different topics and in many cases these topics are relevant political issues in today's news. Usually I am quiet, but as a supporter of freedom of speech I was pretty attentive to this one, because it was about racism and hate speech. A student got up and basically it should be against the law to say words like the N word and other things if you aren't apart of that race. After that I then said my opinion which was essentially being a free speech absolutist. We had a back and forth completely non threatening in any way and I didn't raise my voice at all or make any movements or anything. Eventually I started asking what words were and weren't okay. This was in an attempt to show how ridiculous this could be. I said and used examples and said them these words were Honky, Coon, Wet Back, Bitch, Chink, Uncle Tom just to name a few although I don't know how many others I used (Not many). That was pretty much the end of the discussion some people were clearly uncomfortable, but I honestly didn't care. I didn't use any of these words to refer to other students, or in a demeaning way. I was just asking about what words were okay and what ones weren't. This was yesterday morning when this class took place. I am supposed to have class again tomorrow, however I got an email from my instructor saying she had gotten contacted by a number of students who said they were uncomfortable with the language I used, and she doesn't think I should attend class anymore. She also stated that she had set up a meeting with me, her, and her boss (I believe the dean) about how to move forward from here. She told me she could kick me out of class if that was necessary. This class is just about over. The final is next week. I think this is unfair, and I would argue illegal. I plan on attending class tomorrow, and I've called my boss to tell her I will be late because of the meeting.

9ffhpu	legaladvice	"All,&amp;#x200B;I really need some help, I am not bullshitting at all.  I am going through a gigatic personal issue and need to know how to deal with the situation from an employment standpoint.  Let me break down the situation for you, I'll try to make it quick as possible but all the details I feel are super important.  &amp;#x200B;I currently co-parent my 2 children with my ex-wife.  Our children are a 5 year old son and an 8 year old daughter.  If you ask me we got divorced because she has an evil switch.  She is as sweet as pie and nice, helpful, kind, but as soon as her switch flips she flies off the complete handle at absolutely everyone around her publicly or privately, talks shit about everyone, causes drama at every workplace, restaurant, store, friendship, everywhere.  She knows she has extreme anger issues.  I could not live with that, woke the fuck up and moved my whole life out.  Since 5 years ago when I moved out I have made it my life's #1 goal to be the best co-parents we could be.  We live in the same neighborhood 3 blocks away for the children, we go to stuff like hockey games together, we have dinner at each other's houses, discuss homework and discipline.  Honestly I don't know anyone who co-parents better.  The thing is, at least once a month, she completely flips out on me for nothing at all, tells me how much a piece of shit I am, how selfish I am, just really goes for the jugular and says the absolute meanest things she can say in order to be hurtful.  She was raised in this kind of environment and mirror's the behavior of her father exactly.  She is, a high majority of the time, able to keep this away from the children.    About once a year, though, she does slip up and talk some shit around the kids.  I just instantly leave and try to play it off as hard as I can.  There is absolutely no rhyme or reason, she will beef over the color of a skittle if it is that time of the day and just do her best to verbally destroy you.  The only reason we continue to co-parent well is that she recognizes she has these episodes after a week, aplogizes like its NBD and I take it on the chin to ensure my kids have a stable happy communicating parenting team.&amp;#x200B;Well lets just say over the last few months she has been degenerating.  Every time she is on the phone she is screaming at a driver, literally screaming at my kids about them getting ready for school, screaming at me for whatever reason in the world, talking shit, cursing out everyone in the world and saying ""she doesn't care, she's an adult and she can act however she wants"".  She is about 38.  I am not saying I am a saint but I live only for my children straight up and would do anything for them.  I really don't do anything she could be mad about, I pay her legit child support even though I have the kids 50% of the time at a minimum, I take the kids every single time she asks, I pay for all activities, I am the shoulder she cries on when she has problems which is all the time.  She is frustrated because she is beautiful and she can't find anyone to love her and all her friends see her coming and run.  She is well known as a monster and I really am not exagggerating.  All of this was something I was willing to deal with until recently.&amp;#x200B;As her vitriol, vulgarity, verbal abuse of the children increased (she tells them fuck you, calls my daughter a bitch, screams at them for the most menial things, they are scared to talk to her about anything), I decided it is time to speak with her about it, this is about 1 month and a half ago.  Her response to me was basically fuck off, I don't understand her problems and she can talk any way she wants, I'm selfish, eat a dick.  To be clear this has NEVER been our rapport even in the worst of times.  Her attitude and responsiblility for it has disappeared. The kids brought up the specific things she says to them again and again and I just keep attempting to discuss with her but to no avail.  I have been at a loss at what to do and as a failure of mine, I have not acted on this situation at all?  Can I even in today's sexist family courts?&amp;#x200B;Well this last weekend is where it really fires up.  I am taking my 2 children on a 8 hour roadtrip to go to my brother's wedding.  My children and I are road warriors, we love this stuff so no big deal at all.  My daugther, though, about 5 hours in when my son is sleeping, decides to confide in me.  She tells me that her mom is being physical with her and she is scared. She says when her mom gets mad she pulls her hair and flings her around, that this happens frequently.  Also she grabs her by the arm and shoves her into the wall or grabs her so hard and pushes her around that it hurts and scares her.  She says that when her mom picks her up from school (2 days a week) that she is always mad at them and says things like ""my day was perfect until I came and picked you up and you assholes just ruined it."" The story went on for a half hour and I was mortified.  I let her go to bed when we got to town and the next day I spoke with her brother without leading him on at all and all he could do was cry and recount almost the exact same experience.  I just died inside, how could I not have noticed?  I promised them both that I would talk to their mom and it would NEVER happen again even though they begged me not to as their mom had told them to never tell me or else.&amp;#x200B;We got back to town after overall a great wedding weekend.  The kids went to her house last night and I was still really formulating how to bring the situation up with her to make her change what I view as verbal and physical abuse.  How to discuss with her so that she changes and we don't come to a situation where there is some goddamn custody battle or something that ruins our relationship and in turn the children's.  Whether she did it or not, ultimaltey I just wanted her to learn a lifelong lesson hopefully and everything went bad.  I ended up not talking to her yesterday as I had not fully gathered my thoughts.  &amp;#x200B;Well fuck me because today I picked up my kids from school and they asked me if I had a talk with their mom.  I said I hadn't had a chance to yet, that I was sorry, but that before she sees them again i will do so. I had done some thinking.  They proceed to tell me that the night before, after I promised this wouldn't happen any longer, that she had shoved my daughter by the head into the wall for not picking up guinea pig poop fast enough.  She said she couldn't get to sleep until she was given Ibuprofin and was scared and sad all night.  This destroyed me, this is now my fault.  They on the drive home began to load me up with more and more information about how she hits them in different ways, calls them fuckers, flips them off, screams constantly, just an upgrade on everything.  Well she called tonight and I figured I wasn't going to wait for coffee.&amp;#x200B;I started the conversation by saying ""I am approaching this as your friend and partner, not to judge you or put you in a defensive position, but to give you a glimpse into the eyes of your children""  I began to break down for her only the words that here children had said about again what I consider verbal and physical abuse.  I expeceted her to deny but crazy enough, she immediatley owned up to every bit of it, said she was suicidal, didn't want to live anymore, said she had family issues (which she does) and just took ownership.  She even went as far as to say that she thinks I should take them for a while and I totally agree.  Keep in mind I'm well aware that this could be a tactic and I am being as careful as I can and also as supportive as I can.  Also keep in mind that after my first conversation with the kids I recorded all subsequent conversations with the kids and every phone conversation with my ex-wife so ALL this is saved on my Google Drive.  I live in Idaho so 1 party consent, mf.  Her balls are kinda to the wall but that is not why I am here.  That is more a long term play as I have told her for the time being I will be taking physical custody of the kids, but not with involvement of the court until she can prove that she is making moves in earnest to ensure this behavior does not happen one more time.  That her kids love her but are scared of her.&amp;#x200B;Now to my legal question, I work a M-F 6am to 3:30pm job basically. She has been responsible for dropping the kids off as her schedule is very flexible and I pick them up.  Hey its just something more to integrate our days together.  For at least the next week, I will be having to take the kids to school at 9am and show up at work about 930am which is about 3.5 hours late.  My schedule is not locked in stone, I can generally come and go as I  please but this amount of variance would be frowned upon.  Also our company has recently hired a new CTO to take our company public and lets just say in the nicest possible terms that the new guy is trying to axe every exisiting employee he can.  Either that or he is forcing out the good employees by treating people like shit.  I was hoping there is some sort of protection out there for me while I am in the middle of dealing with this issue?  Does FMLA apply, anything at all?  I am a 4 year employee and as a salesperson I can comfortably say that I am the top consistent employee that they have in the business which at this time puts a specific target on my head anyways as you can guess while cost cutting.&amp;#x200B;Please I need help by tomorrow.

ch8uen	legaladvice	Hey Reddit!My father was a singer and died of a stroke about 10 years ago. He was in a band in the 80s and had a big hit but signed a horrible record deal where they pretty much took all his money. I think he signed with another record deal and he had been releasing music since then. He was also performing in France and other overseas countries a lot. His music is currently on Spotify, Youtube, etc however we are not sure who put it there and who rightfully owns it. It even plays on the radio from time to time. Strangely enough, we did receive a royalty check years ago for a hefty amount, $20,000 and would like to know if there is more we are entitled to. I believe we have the name of the current record company that owns his music or at least is responsible for royalties. My mother is currently looking for a second job to pay her mortgage as we have definitely struggled since his passing and are still just getting by to this day.

bygnly	legaladvice	We bought our home in 2004 on a one acre lot in a suburb in Virginia. In 2014, our next door neighbor who had lived next door since our houses were built, passed away. In 2015, a young family moved in. In 2016, we had a survey done in order to build a fence. The surveyors found that a 3x 3 foot area of neighbors driveway is on our property.Consulted a local real estate attorney recommended to us by the attorney who handled our wills. He recommended that we kindly approach new neighbors, discuss the situation, and ask them to sign a “permission of use” letter stating they have our permission to use the part of their driveway that is on our property.They refused! Mumbled something about a family member recommending they not sign it.Went back to our attorney who said “huh that is very strange. Nothing you can do now but take them to court, which could lead to hard feelings”.My main (only) concern is that we don’t want any trouble if we try to sell in a few years. We went ahead with the fence on the attorney’s recommendation and it is close to their driveway but not on it (as we would not want to anger them).Should we consult a different attorney?

al3o0r	legaladvice	"I'm an owner in an HOA in Indiana and have a bizarre series of events unfold with my HOA. I've summarised the situation below:**An Odd Beginning*** I adopted a rescue puppy (Julian) in May 2015.* Other dogs lived at our HOA at this time and still currently do as of this writing.* After a chance meeting outside walking Julian one day we ran into a board member (Frank) and he took a bizarre liking to the dog e.g. started sending treats, coming by with leftover steak, offering to purchase the dog, etc.* Several months later I started to receive letters from the board threatening to remove the dog due to continuous barking and that it was against HOA rules to have a dog (which was not true - Julian was not a barker and I or my roommate at the time were home with him 90% of the time and never heard anything of the sort)**The Extortion*** In an effort to get some separation, I provided them a note for a therapy animal from a psychologist for anxiety.* They accepted the note and requested that I pay $200 for an animal fee. Which I did.* Several months later they continued to pressure me and harass me to remove the dog and threatening legal action all while other dogs were living here.* Frank (board member who took a liking to puppy) offered to purchase the dog for the guarantee of having the Board revoke its litigation efforts.* I sold the dog to Frank unwillingly in an abusive/extortive exchange May 2016 for $2000 (that was total cost of medical and food expenses to that point) and settlement of the issue.* In January of 2017 I learned that the  board had given approval to other members of the HOA to be allowed to have dogs. There are currently several dogs living on the premises.* I withheld monthly dues until I was able to meet in person with the board to discuss the meaning of this selective enforcement at their annual meeting in March 2017.* I met with the board at their meeting and had our discussion. I came current on my past dues (and paid late fees) immediately after our discussion.* Looking back I obviously regret this move to withhold my dues out of frustration.* I thought this was done. I had said my peace.**More Extortion*** Concurrently, they had begun to file suit against me in small claims court for the 3-4 months of past dues.* I was never notified that they were serving me a suit nor contacted me to let me know they were.* I was regularly contacted via email about the dog situation while they were trying to obtain my dog however they failed to communicate with me on this issue at all.* At this point in time, I had begun to travel more frequently and regularly and have communicated with them that the best way to reach me is via email - not once did they email me. A paper copy of the suit was served but I had been gone and never received it until after the trial.* Default judgment occurred because I was not present (I never knew about the lawsuit) 4/10/17 for ""legal fees"" related to trying to collect on the monthly dues even though I had paid them in full at this point. The HOA received a judgment for $1,008 in legal fees on 4/21/17 in small claims court.* They were able to do this because our HOA has a clause that states 'any legal fees incurred on behalf of a member are to be paid by that member'* I motioned to set aside/vacate judgment filed once I became aware of suit 5/19/17.* 7/10/17 re-trial was set and occurred but the HOA still received judgment in their favor.  HOA remained with the judgment for $1,793.* After this, I attempted to settle with HOA and get on some sort of payment plan but they were not receptive.**It Continues*** Starting on 9/25/17 my HOA began using their attorney for collection activities on their last settlement which I have not paid as of this writing after failing to negotiate a settlement or payment plan with them.* They also do not allow me to come to monthly meetings or share the meeting minutes with me.* To date, the attorney has accrued more than +$2500 in fees for services related to collecting on their original judgment - even though I haven't heard from the attorney once. The current total of attorney fees is $2,518. Plus the $1,008 from the last small claims suit puts the **total at $3,526** for which they are attempting to collect on now.What should I do?

9ny4ed	legaladvice	TL:DR is at the bottom. Any advice is appreciated.I understand this is just advice, and not a real legal forum. However, I'm planning on talking to a lawyer on Monday.The situation is that my bf, with whom I'm living with, has been living in a house that his mother had been making payments on. However, she died almost three years ago, and my bf was barely able to afford basic expenses, not including the mortgage. So, he's been living here without doing anything with the house payments. The house was intended to go to him, according to a living trust, but his sister's name was also associated. She's AWOL, hasn't been seen in years.With her still on the living trust, his one attempt to sell the house fell through. He was told that he would have to jump through a lot of legal ropes in order to remove her, and at the time, he really didn't want to deal with it. So, he never sold the house, and his sister is still on the paperwork.We have received multiple notices that the house was potentially going into foreclosure, but he never did anything further. I know, I know, we should have been working on this a long time ago. However, depression and other factors just made it hard for him to deal with it.I have a very limited income, which is going to change next month. My disability status changed from SSI to SSDI, so I have a lot of backpay that I'm waiting to get. However, it sounds like it won't come until January, or maybe even February. However, if I can somehow secure a loan to cover the moneys owed on the house (less than $75,000), then I'd be more than willing to use my backpay (I think it's going to be somewhere in the 20K range) with the loan. The house would be put in my name, and we'd probably end up selling it later to use some of the equity.However, right this second, we have NO money, and my first SSDI check might not be a full one because of a double payment of Medicare.With a roommate's help, my first check and his money should be enough (hopefully) to get us moved out into a cheap place, if we need it. It's not what we want, since we wouldn't have a lot of time to move everything that we own, but I think it's possible.Both the roommate and my bf are vets, and I'm a disabled female (roommate is also disabled), so I'm wondering if that might work in our favor as well.I know this is a lot of information, but does anyone have any advice, or can give me a link to review?TL:DR--Two vets and a disabled female are having a house sold out from under them on 11/9/18. House is under deceased mother of one vet, vet never made mortgage payments after mother died. Won't have money to cover house debt, but will receive backpay that is (likely) more than 33% of what is owed. However, it won't be available for a few months, and we might not have any other resources until then, other than a basic monthly stipend for living expenses. Only choice may be to have to move into the cheapest place we can find until backpay comes in, if we lose the house.

He was told to fill out the paperwork as if it were me and sign my name.

But seeing as I don’t have anyone but myself here, I’m not sure if a will stating that the house/whatever goes to my brother’s kids however it goes is important to have, or if it’s jumping the gun, or just overall a bad idea.

c7ht65	legaladvice	I recently sold a house in Las Vegas that was previously rented out. There was a root problem in the exit sewage line which had been fixed and trees removed. It was my first time selling a property, I had no idea I must include that on the Disclosure and my listing agent didn't explain it to me when we went through the documents. Then within less than 2 months, the new buyer filed a suit against me and my agent for failure to disclose the plumbing problem. Buyer claimed the exit sewage was clogged and caused flooding in 1st floor bathroom. In less than a month, the buyer got in contact with the previous tenants and both parties just happened to be Russians. The buyer sent me a letter made to look like an attorney notice and is asking for cash without providing photos nor repair costs receipts. Buyer never took photos showing the flooding, never contacted the Real Estate Agency for immediate assistance. And in the letter the buyer stated the cash is for the unplanned plumbing repairs. Anyone encountering such issue would seek immediate remedy rather than filing a suit of any kind. I believe the actual plumbing issue never occurred. This is about the issue not being recorded on the Disclosure. And buyer knew about the previously fixed root problem in the sewage line because buyer and the last tenants know each other and had the information beforehand.

I relocated here from NY and all my family and friends, including my mom, are still back there. When I moved here in 2015, the first people I met and the only friends I've made here were my next-door neighbors. Although they are my friends, this couple has a documented history of not respecting boundaries, including being arrested for trespassing on the guy-behind-me's property, trying to adverse possess the empty lot behind them, and now this issue...In 2017, these neighbors put in a fairly expensive pool and added a screened-in sunroom to their back porch. They did not follow the permitting process and have been cited by county code enforcement for encroaching my 20 ft setback. *Their only recourse is remove their screened in sunroom or purchase an approx. 9 x 30 foot piece of my fenced-in backyard to bring them into compliance.*I don't particularly want to oblige them as they knew they were out of compliance due to their house being built within the setback. They were granted a variance on the house, but adding the screened room was not allowed. They knew this and built it anyway.My mother wants to sell them the piece they need as a favor, but **I would like to know what questions I should ask before completing the sale**. She wants to do this quickly and easily without any conditions to the sale, like moving the fence to the new property line. Post-sale, they will effectively own a piece of my backyard. After this, she would like to put our property up for sale because she does not want to be neighbors with them. Surveys have been done on both properties and the lot lines will be adjusted. If this is lawyer territory I understand, but was just looking for some practical advice from the LA community first.  THANKS Apologies in advance for the blog post. Here have a Shitty MS Paint Drawing® by way of apology.[Shitty MS Paint Drawing®](https://imgur.com/mSeEl60)	TIME	Do you have a mortgage?	<RESPONSE_TIME_0_AUTHOR>	Has your mother thought of the impact this decision will have on her property value?	<RESPONSE_TIME_1_AUTHOR>	real

clvbkj	legaladvice	Good day, people. Please read the story after the question for context; thanks for the legal advice.For those familiar with the Philippine laws, is there a Republic Act that states that all companies and owners of arcade game cabinets (e.g. World of Fun, Quantum Amusement, Tom's World) are required to maintain the cabinets to be updated (to the latest versions) and maintained constantly for the customers?Here's why. There is a branch of World of Fun amusement arcade in a Walter Mart mall where they have a Pump It Up Fiesta EX machine (which is already old \[8 years to be exact from this post\], because there were like 5 versions newer than this, with the newest being Pump It Up XX \[20th Anniversary Edition\]). In the last 2-3 years, the P1 and P2 pads in the cabinet were malfunctioning - with P1 pad with some or all of the buttons not working or squishy, and P2 pad either shaky when using the bar or the back buttons not working consistently. The worst part is that in those the cabinet is still there today with little to no repair, and with NO update at all; I played there every once in a while to see if the pads would be fixed at least - but they did not, which is frustrating for avid players.I brought this problem up to the branch's maintenance crew, and despite them promising to repair the pads or to upgrade the game to the newest version, they did little or nothing at all to alleviate the problem. In my opinion, they could have just pulled out the game altogether, sold the cabinet and saved tons of money so that they can either buy a new PIU game or fix the other arcade games (there are others not working as well).

922fsx	legaladvice	My brother passed. Left no will no wife no kids. So it automatically goes to my brother and I in the state of TN. He is currently living in the estate. I gave him 3 options. He can take a loan out for 250k and buy me  out. We can come together as brothers and sell together. Or I can get a lawyer and we both lose a lot of money. He doesn't want to take out a loan in case he gets sick and can't work to pay for it. Mind you he has worked all these years and in the process lost 1 home to bankruptcy another home to foreclosure and doesn't own the property his business sits in cause he took a loan against it. But has a lifetime stay. Second option he doesn't want to sell what our brother worked for all his life. Ok I get that. He's being greedy.

They recently flagged my account for fraud (although there were no fraudulent charges).  To clear the account they want copies of Nevada DL and SS card emailed to confirm my identity. I am not comfortable sending a credit card company hard copies of my SS card.  So I sent my DL and redacted the number.  They would not accept stating needing front AND back and number of DL.  Next I emailed them a copy of my Passport, copy of DL with numbers redacted, and a copy of my SS card with first five numbers redacted.  They would not accept. Next I had an ""Affidavit of Identity"" notarized which included the numbers for my Passport, DL, and SS card.  I mailed (snail mail) the original to Cap One.  They would not accept.  When I asked why they would not accept a legal notarized document, the manager's response was ""we have the right to ask for SS card due to the Patriot Act"" and ""anyone can become a notary"".  After all this I requested to close the account.  They will not close the account without a copy of my Soc Sec Card.  The Fraud Dept manager informed me the account would remain in ""suspended"" state indefinitely.  Furthermore I would be responsible for paying the yearly account fees of $39 even though I cannot use the account....or close it. In addition, they also have $95 in cash back rewards that is also ""suspended"".Last week on 1/4 I paid the remaining balance in full.  However, two days ago they charged the yearly fee of $39.

8quose	legaladvice	So, my mother went to one of those self enrichment type seminars, which was being held in Virginia, with the parent company being located in California. My mom lives in Maryland. At this seminar she was convinced to sign two contracts for coaching sessions over the course of the next year that totaled $12,959 and $41,850 respectively. After talking to her and her having some time to think about it, she realized that she is not comfortable with actually paying the amounts stated. I'm not sure how much she has actually paid them as of yet, but I know it is not the full amount, as she had asked me for a personal loan to help pay for this.She has been trying to get in contact with them for a day or two about this, and they have been responding with non-statements, saying they will get back to her later.She assures me that she is going to send certified mail with an unequivocal notice that she is  canceling the contract before the end of the day today, which includes her name, address, contact information and clear identifying information on the contracts she wishes to cancel, and I think she signed the contract on Sunday, so this hopefully falls within 3 business days.That being said I have no idea if you can cancel a contract like this, and if you can't what options are left to her to not owe the full sum?

9ohp1z	legaladvice	OK here is the long and the short of it. I was dating my former partner for 10 years up until this fall when our relationship went south. 3 years prior, we had purchased a to-be-built home in a new suburb. When we bought the home the money came from 3 sources mine, his, and his Aunts. His aunt was willing to help us out and was looking to invest some extra cash. The cost was split 3 ways divided like this mine=1/4, His=1/4, His Aunt= 1/2. All costs were split this way, except living costs (heat hydro ex.) those were split between me and my partner alone. Now we are selling the home but I’m facing one big issue, I don’t have any legal document saying I’m part owner of this home. I fear that if things turn more hostile between the ex and myself (fyi I’m not in any physical danger and I’m 100% safe) I might not have any legal right to part of the sale of this home. That cannot happen; I need this money for my own future. So my question is can someone point me in the right direction in terms of legal advice? Like what kind of lawyer would I need to talk to make sure I get what is mine? Edit: their names are on the deed.Any information would be super helpful.We live in Ontario Canada.

bnuudj	legaladvice	"My fiancee and i are renting a home with a small fenced in yard in the Portland, OR area and we are part of an HOA. Our landlord is the home owner. We're responsible for yard work. Our ""neighbor"" is a fairly large townhome style apartment complex. The part that borders our yard is just a large open space area. Against our fence is an insane overgrown of Himalayan blackberry, a highly invasive species in Oregon. For anyone who hasn't dealt with this stuff, it's basically impossible to remove without digging up the roots, which can be as deep and thick as small tree roots. The vines from the plant can reach 50 feet high and 2"" thick, with massive thorns. They also grow new plants where they touch down and the berries also fall down and create more new plants. There's basically a mini forest of this stuff against our yard. It grows under, over, and through our fence (which also damages the fence). It's growing 50 feet up some of our large trees near the property line, and up through some of our shrubs, strangling everything. For the second straight year of living here i do my best to cut it back against our property line, usually getting sliced up by the thorns in the process. I spend every week dealing with it as it can grow over 5 feet in a single week. Unrelated, but they also have chain smoking alcoholic tenants who leave their cigarette butts and bottle caps along the fence, which then just continues to all come into our yard every time it rains. We have contacted our landlord, HOA, and their management. Nobody will do anything. We will probably only be here another year, so i don't want to waste the effort going to court or anything like that. Do we have any other reasonable options? Can we call the police or anything?"

8sih8j	pcmasterrace	I want to upgrade my current pc as I will be going to college for engineering and want to have a powerful desktop in addition to my laptop for some higher end tasks and some light gaming. I'm thinking a ryzen system because they have guaranteed socket compatibility until 2020 or something like that, so there is there is the possibility to upgrade, unlike intel that switches socket every twoish years. There are some parts I will be reusing from my current build, and some that I will be purchasing new. They will be noted in the pc part picker link. I like the 2700x because it can cinebench higher (higher cinebench = more coolness), has better multicore performance because of more cores, and has an arguably better stock cooler (based on what I have heard, so correct me if I'm wrong). The 2600x, on the otherhand, is about $100 cheaper and will save me money to upgrade some other parts up front. When I upgrade, I plan to but the core components first, like the cpu, motherboard, ram, and storage and then save a bit more to upgrade the rest like adding in the Dark Rock Pro 4 and possibly a higher end graphics card.Also if you have any suggestions as to where I could improve on my parts list, please comment below.

8k5rbp	pcmasterrace	Not sure if this is the correct sub to have this conversation.Background:Old IT guy was buying shit workstations at the cheapest price.  I have only been here a year and my workstation can barely keep up.  We got people in my department who haven't had a replacement in 6\-7 years.  I said this is crap and started working out a schedule to update and replace the workstations.  New IT guy \(HUGE Apple fan boy\) wants us to look at getting Macs instead of PC workstations.Problem:His claims are Macs are more reliable and will be less expensive in the long run.  [This is the article he sent me.](http://www.businessinsider.com/an-ibm-it-guy-macs-are-300-cheaper-to-own-than-windows-2016-10)  Finding the most comparable build to an Apple, at the lowest price, would be Mac Mini.  It will still be $100 more expensive and doesn't support a three monitor option we want for some users.  Not to mention expandability, repairability, and training for employees.I think this is crazy.  Is there something I am missing or is his love of Apple products blinding him?  I told him that MB Pros may be good for Marketing but Accounting \(our departement\) doesn't need to live in the Apple\-verse for the products we use.

9a6gum	pcmasterrace	Hello,I'm going to do my best to explain this as clearly as possible.I've had this PC for around 2 years now. I built it myself. It has been amazing and I love it. However, throughout these 2 years I have always been debating whether I should overclock or not. Yesterday afternoon I came across a youtube video and it gave me more confidence to overclock due to getting the 'most' out of the money I spent on this rig.So I watched several youtube videos then I finally gave it a shot. I started carefully. I started at +10 core clock and kept increasing the core clock by +10 after every sucefull benchmark playthrough. I managed to get  to +110 core clock then all of a sudden my entire PC shut off. Now here is the problem. My PC would no longer turn on which made me panik thinking I broke everything. After hours of trying to boot my PC back up I found the problem to be the GPU. The PC will not boot if the GPU cable is plugged into the PSU.I then removed the GPU entirely and started my PC up then I encountered a problem with my keyboard and mouse. After windows loaded I hear the sound of a USB being connected and then my mouse click didn't register yet my cursor would move. After another hour of trying to fix this problem I ended up booting my entire PC in safe mode and removing my GPU and Logitech mosue driver. I can now boot my PC and my keyboard and mouse works.I have a very old PC which has a 750 Ti. I'm currently using that 750 Ti in this PC and everything works. However my other PC is so old and the PSU isn't modular so I can't test the 980ti in that machine.So my question is how the hell did I break my 980Ti from just putting +110 on the core clock? Why doesn't my GPU no longer work? I should alsdo add last night I did have a scent of a burning smell. I couldn't locate the smell because it was brief and disappeared.Please help me :(	TIME	OS your GPU under warranty?	<RESPONSE_TIME_0_AUTHOR>	Did you have any better cooling than just the case fans/GPU fans?	<RESPONSE_TIME_1_AUTHOR>	real

9wglur	pcmasterrace	So I'm a 22 yo woman who grew up with a gaming brother and we used to stay up late to play Wow, counter strike, hitman etc. So much fun. At that time getting a pc wasn't expensive and you didn't need to splash out a lot of cash to play the latest games.So, years have passed since I gamed on a pc. I have a PS4 but I was looking into getting a gaming pc because I want to play some fps games and don't really enjoy them on a console. But just overall the gaming experience seem to be much better on a pc and I miss having a keyboard and a mouse.To my surprise, a decent gaming pc costs around 1500$ now a days.

c97ggc	pcmasterrace	Hi. Im going to buy my first computer this week and was wondering; is the i7 that much better than the i5 (both 3rd gen) for gaming and editing?The i7 is almost 75% more priced than the i5. Am i better off spending on the i5 and getting a better GPU or i7 a better deal. I'm getting a really good deal with the GTX 960 and now im thinking if i should save the money by getting an i5 and getting an 1050ti or it isn't that much of an upgrade?

(I have enough cash to pay for the one due on June 15). I can technically afford to pay them, but that would require the further selling of various stocks I've invested in for the long term, which would incur capital gains tax.I'm wondering if there is anything I can do, like reach out to the IRS and explain my situation.

Right now I commute to work and school, which takes about 35-40 minutes each way, which I think is dreadful.I have the chance to move into some nice apartments which will take my commute time to about 10 minutes to both work and school, plus the location is great for what nightlife and culture the city has to offer.The problem is the apartments I'm looking at are newly constructed and are some of the most expensive one-bedrooms available in the city. I hate to admit it but I've never lived by myself and was hoping some of you fine people would take a look at my budget and give your opinions on my situation.My net income is about $3500 a month. I contribute 5% to my 401k and have quite a bit in the bank for emergencies and furnishing the new place. I thought it all looked pretty good but everything I was reading said your rent shouldn't be more than 30% of your income and I started to get nervous.

8oi8bg	personalfinance	"Background: I've been with my current employer for almost 4 years. I was hired as a service techinician (servicing/installing bank equipment - locks, safes, pneumatic tube systems, burg/fire alarms, cctv, etc) and was promoted to Service Manager Jan 1 2018.I'm the third person to take (and now lose) this job since I've worked there - It's a small company of 6 employees, and the boss is a hothead and very hard to please. I knew this going in, but I figured for the money it was worth an attempt.I was making $19/hr hourly working full time before, changed to $50k/yr salary once I took the manager job.Today, I had a pretty bullshit ""6 month review"" - He sat me down and basically said, ""I don't think this is working, so I'm making you a tech again, I'll pay you $20/hr. Take the rest of today and tomorrow off, come Wednesday we'll get you rolling in the field again."" He has his reasons, and I don't disagree that there were challenges in working together - but nothing was ever documented on paper, I would just have to sit through angry outbursts once in a while every time he didn't like the way I did something. Most critically, I just took a $9000 dollar pay cut - having just purchased a car, and this puts a huge crunch on my finances. I'm going to spend some time today redoing my budget, and I already don't like how it's going to turn out.Here are my thoughts. If I stay here, that management experience withers away, and loses effectiveness on my resume the longer I continue as a technician.Going back to work there is going to be awkward. That much I can manage, but I see it causing some interpersonal drama now that I'm back working alongside 4 techs I was previously in charge of.Lastly, would this qualify as constructive dismissal? I understand that my job duties are changing as well as my pay - but this is an 18% pay cut that was decided unilaterally. Would I be better served declining it and accepting dismissal, trying to survive off of unemployment while searching for something in the vain of what I was previously doing?This is the first time something like this has happened to me, and while my head is spinning a little, I feel like I can make the best of the situation somehow - just need a little guidance.I appreciate in advance any advice you can offer - and if there are any questions you have for me I'm happy to answer them."

8q1zmj	personalfinance	"Hey everyone! Sorry if this totally isn't the right place for this but I couldn't think of a better subreddit to ask this question. The title is a bit hyperbolic but I'm really at the end of my rope. I'm 24 and feel like I'm trapped in my home. Here's kinda how things went:I was a pretty stellar student until about my sophomore year of highschool. My sophomore year, my parents decided to get into daily yelling matches. Call me a pussy, I'm fine with that, but this absolutely was not the norm for 99% of my life up to that point. It shook me up big time.Starting my sophomore year, my grades began to plummet. I was terrified at school worrying about what I might come home to. I thought about trying to get my license and trying to find a job just to be out of the house as well as having spending cash. My dad would kinda do the whole ""Oh well it can wait."" Blah blah blah. Fine. Whatever. I had ALWAYS planned on taking a break after highschool. I needed it. So after my grades plummeted, I was able to get my ass in gear to focus on schooling again. I graduated and was pretty happy. But the stresses of my parents fighting constantly for 3 years was just too much.To make things worse, my mom had to quit her job because she lost a leg to a random blood clot.Well of course, my dad started hammering me on getting a job. The issue is that he owns a furniture repair business. He REALLY wanted to force me to work for him. For free. The idea being that he feeds me and houses me and all that. I get it. But I dunno it felt a bit ridiculous. He used to HIRE someone else to do all of that. These are things I'm fairly certain you can pass off onto customers OR the new opening in work load can allow you to take on more business I would think. Of course, I didn't look too far into it so I could be way off. It seems like, now, he's constantly gating me off of improving myself. I want to get a job, get a license and improve myself. But every time I bring it up, my dad gates it behind the idea of like ""Why work for someone else when you can work for me and take over the business?"" or ""As soon as you get a job I'm gonna expect you to start paying rent and stuff."" It's not that I think the paying rent is unreasonable but if that's the case, I'd rather just have my own place. It'd prevent drama and arguments over things. I don't use tv in my house for example so paying for cable would be a waste of money.I thought about doing Job Corps but I'm not totally convinced it's the best route for me yet. I still have several months to decide on that anyways if I've exhausted all other options. I feel like my biggest struggle in life is finding the route to get started. I think I'm responsible and focused enough that once I get going, I can manage myself really easily but I have NO CLUE how to actually get going.I feel like one of the first questions I'm going to get is ""Well why aren't you just applying everywhere?"" I have been. I've sent out about 8 in person resumes and about 20 online resumes. No call backs. I feel like I have A LOT of skills related to computers, typing, programming, some design work and things like that but I don't know where to go from here. Any guidance would be helpful. My goal is to get a job, get out, and continue to focus on learning programming in hopes to improve that way.Where do I begin? Again, I'm sorry if this isn't the totally right place for this but I'm kinda desperate."

8rddlk	personalfinance	I'm currently interviewing for a new job while still working at my current one. I got my first request for interview yesterday and I asked for a phone interview, which the hiring manager declined. I'm not 100% sure it'll be the best fit for me, but I'm trying to be conscious of not using too much time to interview. Not so much from a moral standpoint, but more in terms of how little PTO I have, and how difficult it is to use. At this point, if I use any more after my interview next week (for which I took half a day, called it a doctors appt.) I'll go into debt with the company for time. If iI do end up taking a new job, I'll have to pay that back when I leave if I haven't accrued it yet. That's not a huge deal for a few hours, but if I'm interviewing with 3-5 companies, I can see a lot of time going into it. Is there a good way to convince hiring managers to do phone or after-hour interviews? It's relay my only shot at casting a wide net. For reference, I'm in IT, 24, mid-level experience (7 years), and looking for a NOC/Systems engineering/technician role. I understand I won't get an offer through phone interviews alone, but I'd like to be able to at least cut down on the time as most of these will have multiple interviews per position.

8ss8vq	personalfinance	 Hi all,My wife and I are first-time parents, and although we love our little string bean, we have been greeted by a complicated mess of insurance coverage and billing issues. Allow me to summarize:* General note - my wife and I are on separate insurance through our jobs; her insurance is cheaper (100&amp;#37; company paid) though it has a higher deductible. She has $3,200 individual / $6,400 family HDHP coverage. My wife hit her deductible during childbirth. As a result, her plan should kick in for subsequent, required, non-preventive care. We are fortunate in that her plan pays 100&amp;#37; after deductible.* We have gotten three bills for various services for my wife subsequent to her hitting her deductible, all of which should have been covered under the plan.* We were balance-billed for newborn audiology screening because the provider was out of network (this is wrong on multiple levels since our hospital has a policy preventing their providers from balance billing patients who are seen on an in-patient or emergency basis); this was quickly adjusted to be considered in-network, but then we were billed for even more because it was incorrectly processed. Standard audiology screening is **preventive care**, covered by all compliant insurance plans at 100&amp;#37;.* We received bills for multiple other preventive services, all of which are, per our benefits package, covered at 100&amp;#37; irrespective of deductible.In total, the erroneous bills have come to \~$2,000. We were fully prepared for the $3,200 and for subsequent visits when our baby is ill; we were not prepared to be billed due to our insurance company failing to abide by its own policies!We have gotten bills from no fewer than ten different providers; if we weren't educated on our plan coverage, we could easily have just paid these bills without a second thought, and if we had ignored them without contacting the providers and insurance company, our credit would have been hit pretty hard.The story is still playing out - insurance is adjusting the claims it processed wrong - but the moral of the story is to get educated on your benefits *before* having a baby, and read every single bill and EOB you get to make sure you are not paying too much.

8u2s3l	personalfinance	A bit of background about me. I’m a 25 years old System Administrator mainly working with Linux but also have some experience working with other UNIX systems. I have 2 years of experience as a sysadmin and before that I used to work as a developer. I honestly don’t know how long I have been coding, I started coding in university but my degree is in unrelated field. I probably have been coding since 2011 or 2012. So few months ago my company accidentally leaked document which implies that they are planning to close branch I’m working at. They have been closing smaller branches for past year or so. A third (!!!) of people already have gotten notices and either have been fired or will be fired until end of the year. I’m safe for next 6 months or so… Needless to say I have been looking for a new job for a while now. First I even tried to write down every company I’ve applied to in a spreadsheet but I gave up on it. At this point I have applied for over 100 positions. I have tailored both my CV and my CL for those positions. What frustrated me is that a lot of them have unrealistic requirements, like 5+ years of experience with dozens of technologies for a JUNIOR position. Of course for a junior salary. What’s more I’m feeling betrayed in my current job. A while ago I realized that my company doesn’t give a flying fuck about employees. Most of my peers make more than I do, even juniors make more. One of my managers admitted (when we were out drinking) that I don’t make more because of my lack of social skills... Well, that's how his manager justified not increasing my salary. Right now it seems like company is wanting for us to quite. All overtime has to be pre-approved by someone waaaaay up in management chain. Due to ‘budget reasons” and they have implied that we should not expect any salary increased anytime soon.   At this point I just like a complete failure. At first I even tried to write down all positions I was applying for and how long it took them to respond. I gave up after first 50 or so...

8zog29	personalfinance	Throwaway because I don't like to let most folks know about my financial situation.As the title says, I'm 25 years old, and inherited a large sum from my grandfather when he passed away. He passed when I was around 9 years old, and to my understanding, the account was somewhere in the $500k range at the time. By the time I gained control of it, it was just over $700k. Since then, I've used this to pay for two years of community college, a surgery, a reliable car, and a 20% down payment on a modest house. I've also been living off of it, almost entirely. The only other income I make is on my own attempt at starting a small business, which, in all honesty, only makes me a couple hundred bucks a month. The money has been in an Edward Jones stock account for years, and I left it there when I gained control of it. To my understanding, they have it in some sort of diverse stock portfolio, where they automatically move things around based on the level of risk I decide on each year. It's at a low-moderate risk right now. I have about $105k in a single account, and about $310k in an IRA. Thing is, I know... nothing about money. My parents never taught me anything about finances, even knowing what I was sitting on for 15 years, and I guess I just never knew where to start in learning. I know that's almost entirely my fault, but now I just have no idea where to start. I feel embarrassed asking my Edward Jones rep, because I've been sort of trying to pretend I know what he's talking about for four years. He seems like a good financial advisor and he seems to have the best interest in mind for my money (probably because the more I make, the more he makes), but I've just been blindly trusting that he's doing the right thing for years.The money has been sitting steady at $415k since I purchased my home, which was in November of last year. I take out $2,500 per month for living costs, and the accounts gain enough that it stays even. However, I know this money has the potential to gain a lot more, but I feel clueless on how to make better use of it. I don't want to end up slowly dwindling it down to nothing before I'm even 40. Any advice would be much appreciated.

I was super excited but just read a post on here about millennials regretting buying a home. Now I'm panicking. But here's the reasons why I am buying- can y'all tell me if they are good or not? 1) I'm medically retired military. I make a fixed income that I will make for the rest of my life. 2) I don't have to pay a down payment. 3) I own 24 dogs and can't rent anymore (I run a dog rescue). 4) My loan I'm approved for is 300k and I found the perfect place for 200k. 5) I absolutely adore the house. It has five fenced acres and the house is huge and I love the city and it is beyond perfect for me. I thought this was a great next step in my life but now I'm freaked out and crying. Please help.

92xilj	personalfinance	My wife and I have done the math, and it makes the most sense for us to buy. Problem is, we're in a very active and expensive housing market that has us intimidated about buying. Think $450k for a 3br 2 ba, 1650sq ft with a yard (and that's a steal). Our main question is how much house we can afford.On my end, I feel like the 28% of income for housing rule is too conservative for us, as we have no other debts and high potential to earn more in the future. My wife is more risk-averse, and I understand, especially since it feels like our area's housing prices are overinflated. Our biggest fear is a market correction after we've locked in at overinflated prices... Is there a way to mitigate that risk (targeting good school districts for homes that retain more value or something like that)? It's hard to find good advice online for folks in our situation. I think most people that make it to this point have access to in-person advice, but I'm not keen to pay someone to sell me on a home and come from a family that didn't have much, especially not financial advisors.

94xkzf	personalfinance	Before you scream NO! Hear me out...I know 30% is recommended. I live in DC, which is notoriously expensive, with my long-term girlfriend.   She is from a different country, so when family visits, they stay for an extended period of time (4-8 weeks), and putting them in a hotel isn't an option. My parents are also newly retired and would like to be able to come for extended visits as well. So, we need at least a 1 BR + Den, or a 2 BR...We both desire an area that is outside the city, quiet and safe, as my GF takes the train home in the evenings and walks from the station. We would also love a small yard for gardening and our dog to play, and a home office/ workspace for my small, but growing freelancing business, outside of my normal 9-5. We like areas with a small, local business downtown section and friendly neighbors. We're perhaps most interested in a finding a place where we can grow roots, and settle in long term, rather than moving every couple years.   The place we're interested in checks all these boxes, and we love it. The owners (who we like and get along with) are re-locating out of state, and their family friend currently occupies a basement apartment which has a separate entrance. The owners have expressed an interest in eventually selling the property and are open to offering credit for rent paid, should we be interested in purchasing at that point. The neighbors seem very nice and friendly and the location is right on the metro line and equal distance for my GF and I to get to work. We've been searching for a while and this was the first place that really felt like it had what we were looking for. Downside is the rent is on the high end of our budget, after utilities are added in.   GF has no debt, I have about $15k left in student loans.  So, considering all this, would it be completely foolish to go through with renting the place or am I justified in thinking it could be a great place for us to grow into?

As one of the best in the company at what I do I was expecting more and countered their offer with a $1 /hr raise instead and through a few meetings with several managers was told that it will not happen and 4% is the policy and will not be changed.

98upmr	personalfinance	Hey all, first time posting.So my fiancé and I are purchasing a home in Orlando Fl. Using various online tools and the general idea that we should be able to purchase a home on mostly (about 80% or more) my salary, I am feeling spooked by what we can afford vs what everyone tells us we can afford.About us at 29 yrs old: I make 83k a year, and minus deductions and 401k have a take home of 1047 a week. I have no debt currently, but may need a newer car in 2 years. I spend about 60-80 dollars in gas a week, 150 on our mobile bill, about 100 on groceries a week (higher than actual, just being conservative), plus gym, Netflix, etc. we eat out maybe slightly more often than others at 2-3 times a week, but meal prep all our breakfast and lunch for work.She makes 1459 every two weeks, has a newer car payment of 262 a month, plus 37000 in student loans that she pays at 560 a month minimum (normally higher), and has various other expenses but I’m not sure the exact amounts, but mostly small.I have 30,000 in savings for a house and 12000 in emergency savings currently. She has 9000 in emergency savings.It’s tough for me to understand how much house we can afford comfortably, that would allow us to still save at a decent clip or allow us to continue our current lifestyle (which isn’t lavish by any means). I initially told our realtor that we have a limit at 275,000 but recently have been feeling like we can go higher and still be comfortable while saving money. I was hoping you fine folks here could help me figure out that range? Right now we are looking at a house that ticks all our boxes at 335000 but think they will take lower.Oh also, we have a wedding coming up in March of 2019 that has current obligations totaling 12000 remaining.

I have another 10k in my HSA and 22k in a bank savings account.  SSA.gov predicts I'll get 1500 or so monthly, and I might inherit some money as well.  These are my only assets - I have no house and my car is worth a few thousand at best.  I have zero debt.  I worked as a registered nurse for 25 years and left due to burnout.  Originally I was going to take a year off but it's going on two.  I am working as a package handler which takes care of the few expenses I have (I live with my elderly parents) and provides excellent health insurance, but of course I haven't put anything in my retirement since I started.  I probably will go back to nursing eventually but it will be on a part-time basis, both to take care of my parents and because being a nurse is very difficult.  Am I on track for retirement even if never put another dime in?  I live very frugally but I don't want to be a burden to my daughter.  Also, what should I do with my 22k?

On face value, it's obvious which method would yield the better return.But looking at it from a practical standpoint, I can't imagine it being easy to sell my car to another person. I've sold used cars before but they were usually less than $5k so it was easy to find someone willing to buy it with cash. A used car in the $20k range would command a smaller market and even lesser with someone willing to pony it up in cash. Can someone even take out a loan and give me a loan check for that amount?

9hpkbc	personalfinance	My kids lost their dad a few years ago.  He had a high income, and they have a large trust, which is well planned, and will stagger their access, and only give them access at different percentages, with full access at 35.  But they each get around 1800$ a month in SS benefits, and have a 35k retroactive payout not long ago.  They are 12 and 14, and the local public high school is good enough that I think we’ll go there.  I make a reasonable income.  They are good kids, and we live frugally in general.  If they are smart, they need never take out loans.   SS money must be used for the benefit of the kids, and I understand that is defined pretty broadly if the kids are well cared for.   It’s also against the rules to ever give them direct access. I want to train them now to mange money carefully, on their own, invest, etc.   Is it legit to get them checking accounts and credit cards in their own names (with limits of course) and give them all their allowance through their checking account, and make them manage it the way they would as an adult?  Obviously it would all have to be a joint account.  Any other suggestions?   I also thought about trying to spend or invest the balance of their SS account right before they turn 18, but on what?

9krx1p	personalfinance	Been watching this subreddit for awhile, finally decided to register and ask for guidance. I'm 41, and hoping I can somehow make a good life for myself after decades of bad decisions. Here is a little background, when in my 20's I spent most of my time going out and having fun. Wasn't career focused, spent my time at manual labor positions, not saving, and didn't think about retirement. Got married too young, had a son, and divorced. Continued to be immature and party until my early 30's. Credit score - 574. Decided I should grow up and be a man and focus on being a father. I started to take night classes for the IT field. Worked some entry level IT jobs to get experience and work my way up. Still, no retirement or savings and not making much of a wage.Fast forward to today, I'm 41. Credit score hovering around the high 690's - low 700's. Have been in the IT field for 7 years now. I make a good salary for my area, $70,000+. I do pay child support, but that'll be done in 4 years. I finally started a 401k, have been bumping up my contribution, and it is now at 10%. Still, I only have about $15,000 in it. I don't have any other retirement accounts, I know next to nothing about that stuff. I just blindly throw money at it, but can't help but feel I am so far behind in the game of life, like, what's the point at this age.Recently, I took a part-time job, just to pay off credit card debt. I don't have much, under 5 grand. Just want to be debt free, maybe put extra in retirement, or savings...

9mimmy	personalfinance	Hey all,My girlfriend is in her fifth year of school, and the payment is coming up. The semester will cost about $3750. I am out of school 2 years now, and am somewhat financially stable (basically poor but frugal as hell). I make $43k a year and have $100-250 a month of spending money after bills. I also have a strong credit score for 23 (780s). My girlfriend has about $2400 in her bank account, and got denied a loan alone (heh) from wells fargo. She works part time (12hrs) at $16/hr. She has a $1200 credit card with a brand new 660ish credit score. Her current plan is to max out her card and empty her bank account, and live extremely cheaply for the rest of the semester. Imo this isn't a great idea, because she'd be holding a high balance on that card until she's out of school in June 2019 with other living expenses. I am trying to help her out. We've been dating 3+ years and I will be marrying her in a year or two. My ideas are:1) Help her out and put half of the card part of the payment onto one of my cards. I have a lot of credit, and can easily handle ~$700 for a few months as she pays me back.2) Have her apply for more loans, but it's difficult to find any without a consignor. 3) Cosign the loan. Not super hyped on this. We are very stable, almost never fight, and she's responsible. But on the very slim chance something happens I'd hate to be stuck with it going forward. Any other ideas? What is the best option?

I have a relatively easy job (engineering management) though it can be stressful at times. I work an average of 40-60 hours a week.I have saved much of my high salary over the years (currently 300k per year) and I have managed to save 1.1 million (and paid off my house)!

I would like to travel more or try different types of employment.If I work 10 more years, I've calculated that I can have 4 million saved by the time I'm 40.

9ozhqy	personalfinance	So this past week, my fiancee and I found a vehicle we though we would like to purchase for around $23,000 sticker price, and we were aiming to negotiate to around $20,000. The car was used, but only 11,000 miles, and was 6 years old. Research of the vehicle put its fair price at around 19 - 20 thousand. Combined we have enough income to easily cover the price of the auto loan if we financed for 72 Months at around a 5%-6% APR, with $1000 down. I know that we both have very good credit, anywhere from 750 upwards for both of us, however, its is not extensively established. My longest line of credit has been open for about 5 years, but is not continuously used, and my other lines are around the 2-3 year range, also not continuously used. Hers were even less. We have no current mortgages or other liabilities. I know my first mistake was relying on the dealer to work through financing for us, but when they ran our credit reports they expected us to take on a loan at 15% APR! Being a finance major getting ready to graduate, I knew this was absolutely ridiculous for an automobile loan, and was never going to accept a 15% APR, no matter what monthly payments were. I expected a much more reasonable rate seeing as I have excellent credit standing, even without 10 years or more of establishment.So I guess my question to all of you who have gone this before, how were you able to finance your automobile purchases? Does extensive established credit matter that much for an automobile loan? Why did our situation end up this way when we were trying to work out a deal?Thanks All!

9vi382	personalfinance	Hi all, first time poster here. I purchased a property a couple years ago (really got a great deal) and love the property. Recently there has been a buyer purchasing a lot of land in the area (for more than the property is worth). The other deals in the area from this buyer seem to have gone through with a down payment and then significant monthly payments to pay off the price (extremely long escrows, like several years). I wasn’t necessarily interested in selling, but this buyer offered basically 3x what I paid. The caveat is that they want to make a down payment for what our remaining balance is on the loan and then make monthly payments with “bags of cash” until the balance is paid. This would be like 30-50k cash a month. From what I know, the buyer is from an Asian country but owns a lot of land in the U.S.  I also believe they own an online or television retail business from their home country. Beyond that, I don’t know what they do but obviously my inclination is there is something illegal going on but have no idea. My question is how would that work? If I deposit that much cash, I’d obviously have to declare it but have never been in the position of having to declare a cash deposit. Would the buyer have to do paper work as well? Is this offer just too wild (too risky)? Would the bank even accept that much in cash deposits? I’m just not sure what I should do and would appreciate any expertise and advice.

a1rw81	personalfinance	Recently around September I purchased a fairly cheap used car.  The buy was sort of risky, so I decided to use the in house financing to lessen how much money I had tied up in the vehicle.  They do all the registration and DMV work in house, I drive the car home, and patiently wait for the bill.  I found out the car is in really good shape and doesn’t need as much work as I thought, and at this point I want to just pay the vehicle off.  Fast forward 2 months and I still have not received a bill.  The first time I called the bank was waiting on the dealer to submit the paperwork, the second time I called the bank needed a verification of address (guess the dealer forgot to get this?).  So I called the dealer and they said that they used my DMV records for that and that I should be receiving a bill soon.  Another 2 weeks passes, still nothing.  I don’t want to keep calling the bank because I’m scared that would be admitting fault for all of this.  What should I do?

a8ak9c	personalfinance	We've taken our daughter to a really well known gymnastics class starting when she was 5.  She started in the Kindergarten class there in the fall of 2017.  She's 6 now and moved up to their level 1 recreational class.  Its only an hour and a half, one time a week.  She loves it.  Its $100 a month.  She makes friends there, the coaches are great, she's learning a lot of self confidence and fitness, which are the primary reasons we wanted her there.  It was actually her idea to do gymnastics as opposed to Soccer or Dance or anything else that we showed her.  So, she's happy and the price and time commitment are reasonable.  &amp;#x200B;So, last night my wife and I were there watching out daughter and we started chatting with some other parents there.  Their daughters were 7 and 8.  One is on their competition team, the other is on the pre-competition team.  So, their time commitment is 2 weekdays of 3.5 hours, 4 hours on saturday and on top of that, they have to go to a dance school one night a week for the floor routine.  Time commitment aside, the one blurted out that its $3,000.  We're not sure if that is per quarter (which is what they bill, ours is $300/qtr), semi annual or annual.  We didn't wanna ask because our jaws were already on the floor.&amp;#x200B;Now, there is no guarantee that our daughter will even want to do that.  She might want to just stay on the recreational side and just have fun.  But holy shit!!!!!!  That cost is astronomical, as i'd lean that it is most likely per quarter.  My wife and I are on the Dave Ramsey 7 step plan.  We're working on paying off debt, which we're doing well with.  But even if we paid off our debt before this, we'd be on a diet of rice and beans.  &amp;#x200B;I wanted to ask some others here, parents, who the hell do you do this?  Are there any tips or tricks that i could learn to make this more manageable?  How would you even consider this if you have a second or third child, let alone a kid in daycare.  My wife and I have a HHI of around $145/yr.  We have a monthly budget, and almost all our extra money goes toward paying down debt.  The reasons i'm asking is because i want to have a mental plan for this if my daughter would eventually want to do this.

ac5m7o	personalfinance	 I've found that I have issues with spending money...on myself. I've always been a bit on the frugal side. I've paid off my annoying loans, only things left are my wife's car and my mortgage. I'm building a nest egg...I've got 3k on hand in savings, always between 3-5K in checking, and looking to grow another 12k this year as my oh shit I lost my job emergency fund, probably in an investment account somewhere. No issues with debt:income ratio. I don't mind buying stuff for my kids or wife, but I feel guilty as hell buying things for myself. For example, on a whim I bought my wife and kid a Switch (Pokemon themed) on launch day for Lets Go Pikachu/Eevee (they are both huge Pokemon fans, I couldn't give a poke less). $400 spend, no fuck given. But I sit here kicking my ass about spending $30 on a video game for myself, or Gods forbid, thinking about a VR setup at home that would cost about the same as the Switch did.Last week I got an unexpected decent check from my mortgage company due to an escrow overage. $850. I could easily have it be fun money...but naw, my first instinct was to squirrel it away and get some maintenance done on the wife's car, because it was easier to do that mentally then to even consider what I could just blow it on.How do you justify spending some cash on yourself?

My dad makes about $32K and our household is four people. My mom is mainly a housewife but makes ~$20K/year untaxed.My parents are wanting to buy a $400-600K home and want me to cosign (but not pay the mortgage). Is this sensible?

d7yd7o	personalfinance	Hi! I'm in a decent amount of debt and am working really hard to get it figured out. My necessary monthly expenses are as follows: rent at 700 with utilities included, car payment at 250 (I still owe about 14,000 on the car, and I'm upside down on that loan by around 2500), insurance at 300 (I've had some bad luck with wrecks recently, and the car is financed and so requires comprehensive coverage), about 50 for transportation and fuel, and about 200 a month for groceries/etc. I make somewhere in the realm of 2600 a month, and have no real prospect for a raise for at least 4 to 6 months.My everyday expenses are manageable with my current income, but I am in debt and somewhat worried about it. As I said earlier, I've had a few car accidents recently that have cost me pretty heavily, and I have about 3500 in credit card debt incurred. I recently was approved for a balance transfer credit card with a 15 month 0% intro APR, so I have no interest building on that credit card balance until October 2020. I also have student loans totaling around 30,000, but I will be in school for the foreseeable future and those payments are deferred while I am enrolled, and are mostly federal loans. I'm not exactly sure what kind of advice I'm looking for here, I'm just constantly anxious and stressed about my debt and financial situation in general and was hoping maybe somebody might have an idea for any kind of improvements I can make to this situation. One thing I've been wondering is which debt I should prioritize paying down, whether it be the credit cards or my auto loan. My line of thought is that if I can get my principal on the car under the value of my car that I can then sell it, and then divert that money to the credit card loans. The student loan debt is obviously not my favorite thing, but I'm already planning on going with a payment plan and am not as worried about it because of the lower interest rates. If someone could potentially help ease my mind to some extent it would be greatly appreciated.

e97v56	personalfinance	Backstory: My father passed away and left me some money. It's not an enormous sum but it's not small either.   The estate has been settled through a law firm in Australia. They asked me for my banking info to wire the funds to my account but then said their bank refused the transaction because my bank requires wires to go through an intermediary bank first. After doing some research it seems that all U.S banks have to use an intermediary bank for international transfers? Can anyone confirm this? Are there any U.S banks that receive international wires directly with no intermediary?  The only other option the law firm has given me is to have a bank draft couriered to me. This scares me for two reasons:  1. What happens if the bank draft goes missing en route? Does all that money just disappear with it?2. Is an American bank just going to allow me to walk into a branch and deposit a large amount of money drawn on a foreign bank? I don't live in a big city and I feel like a local branch won't know what to do with it.

ed6r0c	personalfinance	Looking for advice, curious if I’m making a misstep.  I know most say you can earn more investing rather than paying a note off early, but here’s my situation.41 yrs old now, married, took a note out on a 30 yr fixed 3.625% interest rate back in 2016 on a $225k mortgage loan.  Prepaid it aggressively and now the balance resides at $104k.  I now have the option to pay it all off.  No other debt.If I did, liquid assets left would be around $25-30k.  I will admit my 401k feels weak at the moment.  Balance there maybe $80k tops?  If I did pay off the note, I would obviously increase 401k contributions to 15% or 16%, whatever the max is now.Current combined gross income between my wife and I is around $110k/yr.What’s best in this situation, take my burnable $104k to pay off my note or invest?  Honestly spooked at doing the later.  Paying off a house early is a choice that I understand, but putting it all into investments just feels like gambling to me.  No kids at the moment, just me and my wife although we are hopeful for that, soon.

efe8fg	personalfinance	"Hi all,just a question I was wondering about recently as I am no expert on cars. Lets say I buy a car for 50k, how would I value / capitalize / depreciate my car overtime? The main questions are the following (assume that no accident / major damage has ever occurred):1. how much value does the car lose in value immediately after purchase (thus a certain part of the purchase price was normally the profit margin for the dealer, how much would that be)2. lets say I never use the car after purchase, at what rate would the car lose value (assume I still take care of the car in the sense that I drive it from time to time so for example the battery doesn't die. This implies an abnormal use of the car, but I am asking this simply as a means of control).3. Lets say I use the car normally, does the car lose value by kilometer / mile, or rather by its age or do the two factors interact?4. Is there a ""terminal value"" of the car where the car still has like a rest value and is no longer really losing value or rather the loss in value is marginal after that point?5.

abwesa	personalfinance	So I (23m) am a heavy duty diesel mechanic who makes roughly $35-40k a year. My job is about 50min drive which consists of highway and freeway driving.  Right now, my vehicle situation is pretty bad. My truck is costing me almost $20 per day in gas while my car is in the garage while I am fixing it. The repairs needed for it are not terribly expensive but will take me a lot of time so I have been thinking about getting something else to drive back and forth to work. Motorcycles are relatively cheap, get great gas mileage, and the insurance cost would be almost 1/4th of what my car is costing me per month.

armhsb	personalfinance	On mobile so apologies for formatting or if previously answered...To start, I make $95k w/ about $10k/yr in bonuses and my wife makes around $42k with no additional income from either of us. I contribute to a 401k and pay a bit into company provided health insurance that covers us both.I use TurboTax as our financial situation is fairly straightforward and as you know it keeps track of your refund/owe amount as you progress. I didn’t have both our W-2s so I went ahead and completed the rest of our return(tried to run itemized but came up short of the standard deduction so I gave up there). I received my W-2 and added that and it was showing a $1300 refund, we got my wife’s and I added that and we are now owing $2300... I typically run everything though the W-4 calculator and our paycheck deductions aren’t far enough off to make up that big of a difference. Is the reason we’re owing simply due to the tax bracket difference and should we simply be taking bigger paycheck deductions or would there be another reason? If we do need to deduct more should we both take more out or just one of us or ??I’ve owed and received refunds in the past but we’re usually with a couple hundred dollars of even, a couple grand is new territory.

d84nbv	personalfinance	My employer allows me to contribute to a post tax 401k, meaning I can go up to the $56k 401k contribution limit. I’ve learned from this sub that this is quite uncommon, and that most employers only let you contribute to a pre-tax 401k. I’m allowed to take all of that post tax money each year and roll it into a Roth IRA without paying any additional taxes on it; however any earnings that were made on that post tax money while it was in the 401k cannot be rolled into the Roth; so they get rolled separately into my traditional IRA. I’ve done this for the last 3 years now. Usually there’s a negligible amount of interest that gets rolled into the traditional IRA, like in the hundreds of dollars. Here’s where the tricky part comes in. I make over 200k a year, so I can’t directly contribute to a Roth IRA, but I can take $6k of after tax income and put it in my traditional IRA, then immediately roll that into my Roth IRA. (What I believe is commonly referred to as a “backdoor Roth”). This allows me to put around $35k total per year into my Roth IRA. But that’s $6k I mentioned briefly intermingles with the aforementioned leftover change in my traditional IRA that comes from the interest earned on post tax 401k contributions before I move it to the Roth IRA. I’ve heard of the pro-rata rule, but I don’t understand how or if it applies to me in this situation. Am I supposed to pay some sort of additional tax? I have my taxes prepared by a tax accountant and for the last three years they’ve been telling me that I’m good, and don’t need to pay anything extra. I believe this to be true, but want to know if anyone else has experience with this specific scenario.

8kxkyb	personalfinance	So I am currently paying around $1500 a month toward my student loans in order to try to aggressively pay them off. I graduated this past December and was fortunate to get a good job that has given me the ability to do this and my goal has been to be debt free by the end of the year. I am still in my grace period for my loan and everything seems to be going well. But my question is, and maybe this stems from a lack of understanding of how loans work, but every month my full $1500 goes toward the principle of the loan and I am not accumulating interest month to month, so I am wondering if it would be smarter to put that money else where like building my e fund a bit (currently around $3k).

I have another 10k in my HSA and 22k in a bank savings account.  SSA.gov predicts I'll get 1500 or so monthly, and I might inherit some money as well.  These are my only assets - I have no house and my car is worth a few thousand at best.  I have zero debt.  I worked as a registered nurse for 25 years and left due to burnout.

I am working as a package handler which takes care of the few expenses I have (I live with my elderly parents) and provides excellent health insurance, but of course I haven't put anything in my retirement since I started.  I probably will go back to nursing eventually but it will be on a part-time basis, both to take care of my parents and because being a nurse is very difficult.

You could say getting good grades is hard work but im just gifted academically and dumb everywhere else.Now im working as a temp because i cant interview and making ""70-80k"" before taxes and i feel like im pocketing nothing despite living frugally af. My monthly takehome after taxes and 401k/rothira cotributions for last month was like 4k even.My total budget including rothira and 401k is about 4700. Here is a breakdown. https://i.imgur.com/o0SrcF8.pngI did spend a little much on gas this month because i traveled all the way home and had to fill up 3-4 times for a total of $133. For rent, im renting a room where the landlord pays all utilities fro $600 flat. food i eat out a lot but my spending didnt exceed $130. I use the same cracked samsung s7 ive been using since 2016 and i drive my mom's old minivan. my parents still pay for car insurance and phone bill. I feel like by the end of 2020 ill only have made 24k for savings and in 10 years that means only 240k. Im working so much harder than i was in school and making barely more than i was then. im also a lot more miserable because literally all my friends in tech/medicine are buying new cars and latest phones and im just living in a shoebox with shitty stuff and still not much money. i cant even buy a house without worrying about what if i get laid off and cant pay my mortgage.I know this might come across as snobby or entitled because so many americans live paycheck to paycheck but i'm literally living on super frugal mode. It shouldnt have to be this hard to save money to buy a house without me spending all my savings. I live in NJ btw."

cva5p1	personalfinance	"Hello all, I've been a lurker here for a while and really enjoy this community and its advice. Now I'm looking for a little help to a question I haven't quite found the answer to yet.&amp;#x200B;Last October I purchased a used Honda Element with $1000 cash down and financed the rest ($4500) through my credit union at a 36 month loan with 5.7% interest (not great because it's an 11 year old car). It had most of the records and had an inspection record from shortly before I bought it. It had around 160k miles on it and I bought it with the intention of hopefully putting another 100k on it.&amp;#x200B;Well, last weekend it kicked the bucket. I was on my way up into the mountains when it broke down and I had to have it towed to a nearby shop. I'll spare the mechanical details since I'm just looking for financial advice at this point, but the gist of it is my car will need a new engine. The original shop quoted me $9,000 (!!!!) but I called around and got an estimate for $4,500. As my car is older, this would be for a used/refurbished engine, not a new one.&amp;#x200B;So here's where I am now. I still owe about $3,400 or so on my original loan. The payments are affordable and I have been making them ahead of schedule easily. I do not really need to have a car since I work pretty close to where I live, but the convenience has been nice, and I love the Honda Element as a car and have been using it for camping etc. It is not driveable in its current condition, and for these major repairs I would have to take out a personal loan to cover them. I'm open to trying to sell it, or somehow trade it in, but I don't really know all my options here or what makes most sense financially in the long run.&amp;#x200B;On one hand, I don't like the idea of going into more debt so part of me says I should just cut it loose, donate it to NPR or something, and just pay off the loan as quickly as possible. But then on the other hand does it make more sense to take on debt to hopefully drive it to the end of its actual life? Or find somewhere where I can actually ""trade"" it in and take on more debt in the form of a newer car that maybe has a warranty or whatever?&amp;#x200B;Other than this car loan, my only other debt is some CC debt (\~$1500) that I've been working through separately in part thanks to a lot of helpful info from this sub.&amp;#x200B;Please let me know if I'm missing any key info here that would help.

9g37tu	personalfinance	I have a 2014 Lexus that I was thinking of trading in. It's current trade value according to KBB is around $18-19k while it's private seller value is around $23-24k. On face value, it's obvious which method would yield the better return.But looking at it from a practical standpoint, I can't imagine it being easy to sell my car to another person. I've sold used cars before but they were usually less than $5k so it was easy to find someone willing to buy it with cash. A used car in the $20k range would command a smaller market and even lesser with someone willing to pony it up in cash. Can someone even take out a loan and give me a loan check for that amount? It just seems like the risk of having that car sit and depreciate is more trouble than its worth to just trade it in. In the last year alone, my car dropped about $3k in value.

9gzh87	personalfinance	Long story short, I work in a cozy office for a University. I am on a team managed by one woman. Last week I made a couple mistakes in my work and things weren't really going my way. I noticed that my boss started to act passive-aggressively towards me: Not saying hello in the morning or making eye contact when I try to talk to her, trying to do my work ahead of me having a chance to get to it, piling on work asking “Where do things stand with this” and adding short turn-around deadlines—basically setting me up for failure. After a couple days, I had enough. Late into an afternoon I walked into her office and asked if I could speak to her. I came off entirely unaggressive and said something to the effect of “I’m not really happy with the way things have been going and it’s making me a bit upset. I don’t think I’ve been quite as effective as a could be, and I would like your help to improve” to which she says something to the effect of “I agree you haven’t been doing well” and nothing more.  She let the conversation die and I stared at her, eventually saying “well I hope I can find a way to improve” and I walk out.This week I had hoped her attitude would be a bit better but she is no different. She continues to ignore me while socializing with other team members. Today, we all had planned 1:1 meetings with her. She ran a bit late on the first one then had the second one. I was suppose to be third in line at 3:00pm. The 2nd meeting got out a little late so I sent her an instant message “if you are tired and would like to reschedule for tomorrow, that is okay with me”. She didn’t respond, and instead hosted the final 4th meeting. She then rescheduled my meeting until tomorrow.Now I am a bit annoyed. I have a cool and calm composure and I can handle a little tension—that’s fine but this is just petty. She is blantly going out of her way to passively toy with me and is ignoring me from a professional standpoint. I am still a solid performer, I know I am. I churn work all day and I try my hardest but she continues to act like this. I’ve considered bringing this to the manager above her, but this honestly does not bother me enough yet. I am not annoyed from a personal perspective but professional. How should I handle this situation?

95u09v	personalfinance	"Hey all, I'm a 19 yo who just started his swim into the great world of adulting and I want to swim out to the open waters and settle down in another reef, so to speak.A bit of backgound info about me:My credit history runs for just over a year now, with a total of 5 accounts (4 credit cards, 2 of which are retail, and a Self Lender credit builder account). My current scores hover around the 720-730 range. I follow religiously by the 30% rule, and I don't have any derogatory accounts, no major debts nor am I in danger of going into collections. I also have a total revolving credit limit of $7,000 (split 50/50 between the two retail cards and my two general cards). The self lender account is a $545 loan locked in a CD until 11 months from now.My family came from the Philippines and I am a first generation child here in America. Because of this, I don't have the sort of $10k lying around from Mom's investments accounts or whatever the story may be. We manage to get by with a little wiggle room for luxuries. That being said, communication with my parents isn't the best, which will come to play later.As of right now, I'm currently working a retail job, with a annual gross pay of roughly $19k, given my current wage and average hours. I have just under $2,000 stashed away in savings. I recently started investing with Stash, but I don't expect to see any huge gains until I'm in my early mid 30s and I've got actual money to invest and not get mere penny returns. Currently, I have regular monthly payments of roughly $210, for my phone bill, public transport and the self lender account.So here's my situation:I want to move to an entirely different state. I'm currently in Hawaii, looking for an apartment and roommates in the SF Bay area or an outlying city, with the plan to have a lease signed and have at least one roommate by the end of the year. I want to move for both personal reasons, and for career/school reasons. I currently am not in school, and I don't plan on returning until I settle in (or have my dreams of moving completely shut down), so I have time to focus on getting me the sweet cash money. I have thought about just dorming for the moment while I plan out a more permanent move plan, but I don't want the burden of student loans bringing me down in the future.Because I'm a first generation American, there's quite a bit of culture differences between how my mom and I see things, and communication is shaky a lot of times (I live with my mom and step father, both from the Philippines, and my step father is an ass so he won't be involved). I have expressed this need to fly out of the nest; both to grow as a person, and in pursuit of a potential career. But due to the general lack of funds and shaky communication, I don't expect much financial help from my mom. Though she is willing to help, she won't be able to contribute much in the way of finance, nor is she a source of guidance for me (sorry mom! Love you, but your comments of ""how come you wanna move"" and ""don't you know it's expensive"" without really... guiding me isn't going to help). With all that being said, quick recap:* Young adult want to move from Hawaii to SF Bay Area at end of year* Good credit, but relatively low funds saved* Not expecting a lot of financial help from parentsI know my situation isn't all that great, and I know y'all are gonna tell me to sit back down and wait until I'm more established financially, but I'm not willing to give up on this plan without a fight, so please humor me. I know I'll need to make some pretty big changes to my financial lifestyle, but I am dead set on this plan, so please tell me what I'll need to do, and what words of advice y'all have to give.

She's paying $265/mo for $600,000 coverage.The policy expiry is coming up in the next 2 months. I just got this letter in the mail which tells me I have a few options if she doesn't want to have another medical exam. So the premium right now is $265/mo.* If she continues with this plan then after 2 months the premiums are going to bump to $627/mo. Yikes!* Then they have this thing called ""custom exchange option"". The new premium ($588) is schedule to remain level for the duration of the plan. The coverage will remain level for 10 years but will decrease every year until the age 100. Wtf why is the premium lower and this decrease coverage stuff?* Option 3 is to decrease death benefit amount and thus have premium decrease.She's in her 60s and this is her second time having cancer so I'm sure she's never getting approved for insurance again. My brain hurts and I feel like an asshole thinking about this. Perhaps it's something to do with betting against her living or not. They initially gave her 8 mo to live but then bumped that to 4-5 years. Her oncologist is optimistic since the cancer hasn't gotten worse (or better) for the last 1.5 years. Hopefully this is a good sign and she begins improving. If I'm optimistic about her health then getting insurance is pointless right? I feel like I'm over complicating it because of the sunk cost fallacy.So the question is **does it make financial sense to continue with life insurance**?I feel like this I'm buying options with month to month payments ($600 x 12 x (10 years) = $72,000.... in one scenario I lose 72K on the other I get 600K (minus 72K). I'm leaning towards cancelling since I could just save those premiums and be up 72K without any risk.Some more info:* I'm the only beneficiary.* I'm set to inherit the house (\~1mill value nearly paid off), although there's a 300K lien from a conman that'll make selling it pain (I would love for some advice on dealing with this).* I have \~180K in cash lying in various bank accounts, although most of it is stuck in corporations that I'm withdrawing from slowly (advice from accountant). Maybe I should invest? lol* I'm not working (aside from gigs/volunteering) due to physical and mental issues and also being her caretaker.* We both live in the house. We have basement tenants. At peak capacity we could take in 3 more roommates but mom ain't down for that anymore. If she died I'd prefer to keep the house rather than sell it. Since there's no more mortgage I might barely break even although emergency expenses would put it back in the red.Anyways I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this.Tl;dr - mom gets cancer, term life expiring, given options by insurer which seem like ballz, can't think rationally so hoping to get some outside input"	TIME	Does the life insurance have any terminal illness riders?	<RESPONSE_TIME_1_AUTHOR>	How much of the $180k are you spending each year?	<RESPONSE_TIME_0_AUTHOR>	real
e66pdf	personalfinance	A little background: 32 year old freelancer, make on average $4,600 per month after taxes. I have a massive amount (around 40k+) of unsecured debt that I racked up from problem gambling between early 2018 and this year. I have abstained from gambling in its entirety for almost 6 months, but during that time I took out multiple high interest loans.Some of these loans I have negotiated down to 0% interest with lower payments, and some have offered me lower payments with 0% interest and halved my amount due. The rest are being handled by a debt settlement company which I am paying $600 per month.In addition to these debts, I owe considerable back taxes to the IRS ($30,000) and state ($6,000). Come new year, I will be paying in excess of $4,500 per month because I will have to start paying on my student loans again and will also have health insurance premiums. I will also soon be paying my back taxes. This will pile on an extra $1,300 per month alone. I basically will be at capacity and that’s without including food/gas/entertainment.I’ve kicked my terrible gambling habit, but I’m not sure what to do now. I’m seriously bummed because even though I’m getting consistent work, most of it is being taken by all of these loan payments, and I can’t plan for the future.Any advice is welcomed.

9c0ngx	personalfinance	To preface this, I came into a significant amount of money from a lawsuit in 2014. I'm trying to comprehend what exactly someone in my position should spend on something like a car.Once I got the money I paid off all student loans I had, all of my debts, bought a home (bought for 305k, now worth 415k), and met with a financial advisor to put me on a correct path. I currently have a little over $300k in the bank, and I'm making a bit over 20k a year from my investments (around 7%).My bills:HOA dues total $360 a monthProperty tax is nearing 2500 yearlyPhone bill is $70/monthCar insurance is $120/monthUtilities total $400 a month which is pretty high from what I can tell, but mostly because of some luxuries I like to have.I just recently graduated college and yesterday received a job offer at 85k to start (software engineering) including a signing bonus. One thing I've always wanted in life was a nice, fast car. I know that's probably a terrible financial decision with how awful depreciation is and whatnot, but I've been severely eyeballing a used P100D for 108k, and after test driving one not too long ago, my mind is telling me to buy it.So here's my question. How exactly do I distinguish how much money I should spend on a big ticket item when I own outright the other major big ticket item, my house?For example, the 28% rule on housing and the 15% rule on transportation. Because I own the house outright, is spending up to 43% on transportation a terrible thing? I'd probably just pay in cash instead of financing (even though I'd be well under the 43%) considering I have the means, but is that even an advisable decision barring the whole depreciation thing for someone in my financial situation?I appreciate any insight, thank you very much.

The problem is that school has left me \~$14,000 in debt, normally this wouldnt be an issue because of student loans, but my bank (and all I've looked into) dont offer student loans for students attending 2 year colleges. Here's the *real* problem: My first account of borrowing for school was when I went to a program through my community college at PSU for a nanotechnology degree. Here I borrowed \~$6,000. My banker told me to put it on my credit card (I know, red flag) so that I could come in at a later time and not borrow more than I need; A big fuck no went off in my head, but I'd been banking with him through my adolescence - present and didn't think he would do me wrong, also my dad went to the bank with me and he wasn't really phased.After placing that and my next semester on my credit card I went in to transfer my debt to a loan. Well, even after having an appropriate income, a good credit score (\~750) and working with them for the entirety of my life, they denied me a personal loan due to ""not enough credit history"".

I started working in a lab recently and want to pursue a PhD soon. But, the store license is expiring soon. A store without a license isn't worth much. My dad wants to sell the store. He thinks its a waste of time and energy and money.

8n0fub	personalfinance	Hey r/personalfinance,I'm a single guy in his early 30's still living at home in rural Ohio. Right now I commute to work and school, which takes about 35-40 minutes each way, which I think is dreadful.I have the chance to move into some nice apartments which will take my commute time to about 10 minutes to both work and school, plus the location is great for what nightlife and culture the city has to offer.The problem is the apartments I'm looking at are newly constructed and are some of the most expensive one-bedrooms available in the city. I hate to admit it but I've never lived by myself and was hoping some of you fine people would take a look at my budget and give your opinions on my situation.My net income is about $3500 a month. I contribute 5% to my 401k and have quite a bit in the bank for emergencies and furnishing the new place. I thought it all looked pretty good but everything I was reading said your rent shouldn't be more than 30% of your income and I started to get nervous.

That checking account is not in my name. I have never opened a personal bank account and have no credit history.Would it be possible to build credit if I were to become a joint owner on that preexisting account?

8vv1o6	personalfinance	Hello everyone.  I’ve been a lurker here for a couple years and this is my first time posting.    I’ll be up front, I was a little hesitant to post on here because I have seen some of the other posts that people make (do I choose this $90k job or this $105k job, or how do I invest this $30,000 I’ve saved in the last two years).  My situation is not like that.  In fact,  I’d be jumping for joy to have those kinds of problems.  The situation:  my wife and I live in a rural area, and we both make $12 an hour, and work full time (40 hrs/week).  We have our big bills like rent (800) car payment (300) and childcare (500) and a series of other smaller bills like utilities that total out to roughly 1700 monthly (including our food/gas).  We do well on budgeting, and live within our means, but that being said, we are barely able to keep our heads above water.  We are living paycheck to paycheck. We have little money for extras like taking my family out to dinner, or even just going for a drive.  I make sure my children are well taken care of in terms of food, education, clothing, etc.  but it has gotten to the point where I don’t know what else I can do.  I haven’t gotten myself anything material in a few years—all my clothes are hand me downs or thrift store, my kids get a couple toys once or twice a year, and I can’t remember the last time my wife and I went on a date.  Does anyone have some advice on how to make and save some extra money, or even good financial tips I should be using?

9jelvh	personalfinance	Hi, longtime lurker, though I seldom post. I recently interviewed for a job at a company that is a closer commute to my home than my current position, and I would end up making substantially more money. As this is my first job after getting a couple years of experience on my resume. However I have an acquaintance who held this position in 2013, at the time he would’ve had a year less experience than I do now when he was hired in. As his base pay he received  $72,000, in my offer letter they are offering me 60,000. Are they lowballing me because it is expected that in this day and age people negotiate a higher wage? I mean on the one hand I’d be making way more than I am now, so am I crazy to even be complaining about it. But if I settle for a lower start pay it would be years before I even reach the other amount let alone even higher. I guess I’m just nervous about trying to bargain for better pay and get the offer rescinded. And even though it’s a closer commute I’d still be commuting an hour and that adds up over time, could I include that as a reason for negotiating a better pay? I guess I am looking for people opinions on the matter and the best way to come off professionally when negotiating, as I’ve never done it before. Any help is appreciated!Ps. Glassdoor does not have a salary listed for this position for this company, but paysa does, but I’ve never heard of that site so I wasn’t sure how reliable it was. But paysa says that $58,000 is the 25%, whereas $72,000 is the average.	TIME	Or plain made it up?	<RESPONSE_TIME_0_AUTHOR>	will that happen every time?	<RESPONSE_TIME_1_AUTHOR>	real
ab0ip9	personalfinance	**Some context:** (Sorry if this doesn't belong in this sub.) In October I stopped working in NY and sort of coasted off of my savings until this December. My boyfriend who lives in WI had the option to terminate his lease early and took it so that we could move in together. Right now I'm going to be working here for ~9.50/h full time starting in January. The main problem right now is housing. &amp;nbsp;The places we've applied to so far seem to dislike us because I just moved and am not working yet or because my last pay stubs were from October and I guess that raises some red flags (I honestly thought me finding a job so quickly and having a decent credit score would be enough to show that I'm a competent tenant/not a liability but I guess I'm wrong.) &amp;nbsp;My boyfriend used his savings for his termination fee + other surprise expenses and I'm pretty much dry right now and coasting off of my credit card. I don't *think* this is too much of a problem right now because I can afford to take the hit to my credit and can pay it all off in January but that's only true if we find housing. So I need some advice/resources for finding housing.&amp;nbsp;**Some general info:**  * Both of us are 21  * My boyfriend's credit score is just above 650, mine is roughly 730 last I checked. * I have ~120 in my checking account, 120 in cash, ~1.2k available credit, and another ~0.5k available credit via Paypal Credit. My boyfriend doesn't have a credit card and as far as this post is concerned is basically dry.  * My boyfriend's last pay stub was from this month, mine was from October (or half way through this January since pay is biweekly.) * Our total monthly income would be somewhere around 2.1k before any reductions.  * Worst case scenario is he moves back in with his parents and I move over overseas to start fresh, but this would have a strong negative impact on his health and composure. We're both obviously trying to avoid this.&amp;nbsp;Right now it looks like either the both of us are going to be staying in a hotel until things get better or he'll move back with his parents and I'll stay in a hotel until can get things sorted out. I can (barely) afford to stay at a hotel alone while I work here (I'm going to have a electric burner to cook on and utilize the free breakfast to try and cut down on food costs) but this is obviously a short term solution and I can't seem to find a place that doesn't view me as a liability. Plus between the hotel/food expenses and my income those application/holding fees are going to start adding up *really* fast. Could you give me some advice?

9jtvzs	personalfinance	I'm currently a senior in college and have one credit card which I don't carry a balance on through a credit union, and have a FICO of 763. I'm in a pretty good financial position: I have no loans of any sort, my financial aid package is pretty decent, I have leftover scholarship/grants from community college that are keeping me afloat, I split rent with three other flatmates, and my parents send gift cards for food here and there. Don't get me wrong, I'm not rolling in cash and new clothes, but I can afford the occasional Chipotle and coffee before classes and that's enough for me. However, traveling back home for the holidays is making my wallet tremble. I live in Southern California and my family is up in the Bay Area, and I am expected to go visit. Tickets are around **$500 round trip** for thanksgiving, and I don't even want to think about Christmas! Driving up is difficult because I don't have a car, but my boyfriend does, so me going up would depend more on his class schedule and I won't be able to spend much time up there anyway. Driving seven-ten hours twice SUCKS and I would ideally like to avoid that.There are several airline credit cards out there that offer companion fares and free upgrades, as well miles with no blackout dates, and I could certainly use the miles to visit family in-state. When I graduate I want to go to grad school, so I have no idea where in the country I will be and would ideally like to fly home over holidays, the most expensive time of the year. Having a companion fare discount would be great because I could split the difference with my boyfriend, so we both save some money! But then again, I'm just a college student who honestly doesn't know much about credit cards, and I don't want to be bit in the butt in the future by getting a card for the rewards.

8w32sr	personalfinance	Hey reddit, hope your July 4th is going better than mine. I done fucked up. It's looking bleak and I'm desperately searching for options, advice, and help from anyone who may have been in a similar situation. So, here's my story...2 years ago, graduating Grad school I designed a house for a new aspiring young professional couple (my gf and I - not married). The house is a 2br, 3ba with a tenant suite, an attached garage in a very contemporary design, green building. It may have been overly ambitious in retrospect, but everyone I'd talked to at the time thought it would be a great investment in an awesome up-and-coming neighborhood. I'd been with my firm for 10+ years, very stable job/income, sizable savings, and looking to settle in the city. My girlfriend currently owns the home we're in, and I'm not party to any of this property (ie she's isolated-ish from my mess). Working with the local city councilman, we found a land-banked lot controlled by the city. I purchased the property and went construction loan hunting. Long story short, I found a bank who would fund the project. $212K project funds. We set aside a 7&amp;#37; contingency (a little on the low side, I know). Everything was ready to roll and we started construction in December of 2017. Right off the bat, we were unexpectedly forced to remove two large trees on the property (we had expected to keep both) $4K in clearing and stump grinding. Ok, that sucks, but that was covered project contingency funds. Excavating the foundations, we encountered a large old building foundation that didn't show up on the geotechnical report, portions needed to be removed and back filled $3K.  As we're purchasing our lumber package to begin framing the house, Canadian lumber prices jump 20&amp;#37;, ooff, another unexpected $2.5K. Once we're under roof and enclosed in spring of 2018, there was a structural issue which required additional steel framing to secure the building, $4k. That's about 80&amp;#37; of the contingency, time to start cutting scope hard. Working with my contractor relations, all the plumbing fixtures were donated (awesome!). Door frames were contributed to the project, but we still had to buy doors. Due to the structural issues above, we had to replace one of the fire-rated garage doors we had previously purchased +$1k.  We dialed back finishes, opted for cheaper flooring, got rid of stone finishes, went with cheap ceramic tile, revised light fixtures, started tearing into all the options to cut scope without impacting the overall design and quality of the house. We get through all our mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and insulation with only minor issues. +/- $100 here and there from our expected costs. We get to drywall and painting and the sub we had contracted backs out of the project due to his workload and delays. The next lowest price was +5K (fuck me). I searched for more options, more contractors, negotiated what I could, and go it to +4.5K. god damn it. Siding package, unforeseen trim expenses. The house was broken into one night and a window was kicked in. Insurance deductible was more than the cost of replacement, so we had to pay that out of pocket. At this point our contingency was expended and my savings for the house had taken a substantial hit, some of which had been earmarked for appliances and furniture.We put my GF's house on the market June 30 and being the awesome neighborhood that it is, we had an offer on the house within 3 days, and are set to close on July 30th. So, the crush was on to complete our new house. Finding a short term lease, to hold us over a few weeks may be an option as we finish the house and get occupancy (or partial) if necessary. Then I got the worse news of the project, I was notified by the city that the existing water line we had expected to reuse failed it's inspections and would need to replaced. The new connection to the main would be at our expense. Requiring a street opening, city contractors and repairs, +$8K-$12K. Despite many exchanges back-and-forth with the city officials, the engineers, and councilman, they are maintaining it is the Owner's responsibility to cover these expenses. That's the nail in the coffin.As it stands today, July 4th, I'm 90&amp;#37; complete. I've paid out $185K of the $212K available in the construction loan. We're over budget by 20&amp;#37; and need about $20K (above the construction loan) to complete the house. My resources are tapped at this point. I've been contributing my time and labor, installing tile, wood floors and cabinets to keep the project moving.  I've come to the realization, that despite my efforts, I can't afford to finish this house and I don't really see a clear path forward. I've gotten advice ranging from declare bankruptcy, to sell the house unfinished and assume any additional debts. I've barely slept for 3 days, and am nauseous from the stress, worry, and frustration at my poor judgement and foresight. I don't want to bee seen as the failure, or incompetent over-ambitious kid who thought he could build, but that's the corner I've painted myself into. I've struggled to accept it. I spoke to a realtor last week. Off the cuff, without seeing the house he thought the value of the home was $250K - $280K. The bank appraised the house at $380K - $400K when we applied for the construction loan. I'm not sure there is any equity in the home to borrow against in the state it's in. My next call tomorrow morning will be to the bank.**TLDR: Spent too much building my house and can't afford to finish.

I'm looking for some assistance with my current financial situation, hopefully someone can help!**Stats:** I'm a 30 year old male, living in Ontario, Canada. I currently have about $10,000 in credit card debt, and I am paying a 19&amp;#37; interest rate. I have a good job that I enjoy, and my income fluctuates but I'd say on average I take home about $1400 per paycheck, so $2800 per month after tax.**Expenses:** I am living rent free currently. I have a cell phone, which is roughly $70/month. Car Payment which is $400/month. Gym membership $40/month. I'm on the road a lot for my job, so I do spend a good chunk of money on gas, and food while on the road (but I do try to bring as much food as I can). I would say this is where most of my income is going currently.**Goals:** Ideally I'd like to be debt free as soon as possible, and begin saving for a down payment on a house.I feel like I'm spinning my wheels making minimum payments on my credit card. I'm not sure the best course of action here, I've heard I could open up a line of credit or a new credit card and transfer the debt while taking advantage of a low interest rate?

9wzuqo	personalfinance	My [24M] wife [23F] and I are just getting started with our careers, and we almost have all of our debt paid off. Our credit scores are great, and we could live off of my salary alone fine, but she will probably be making more than me starting in two years once she finishes law school and gets a job. We are both pretty risk averse, and I’ve always been leery of the way Americans buy a $400k house for a 30-year mortgage (pronounced “debt”) and then end up paying much more for that house over that time period. So, we have been talking about staying in our apartment for a couple years longer than originally planned and trying to buy a house... in cash. Even if not the whole thing, maybe putting like 60% down or more, and trying to have it paid off within four or five years. To me, it’s about cash flow and getting things paid off as quickly as possible so that if something were to happen to one of us (disability or illness, lose our job, etc), we wouldn’t be screwed and living in a bigger house than we can afford. I’m big on not having debt - it terrifies me.I told my friends about it and they thought it was a very dumb idea. They said I should put 20% down or so - however much is needed to get the lowest interest rates possible - and then invest the rest. They said I would get better returns through investing, and it hedges against the risk of your house burns down or property values plummet. I get that, but a) isn’t that what insurance is for, and b) the beauty of owning a house outright is that if the property values plummet and the economy tanks... we wouldn’t really care because we own that house. To me it still makes sense to try to buy a house in cash even if it isn’t the best “investment” decision.Thoughts?

byxnxc	personalfinance	The housing market in my area has been hot. I bought two years ago right before the region took off for 229,000. I met with my realtor today, and he said I could easily list it for $400,000 - $415,000, and sell for 15 to 20 over asking. ( My neighbor recently got over their asking in the same range.)I knew this house wouldn't be my 'forever' home. It would serve as a starter home. However I've been tossing up the idea of moving outside of town, and purchasing a rural property with acreage.The properties im looking into are in the 600,000 to 800,000 range. With 15-50 acres. I'm looking in, and out of the county. A lot of the properties I'm looking at are not in a very hot market. However I could see a few of them become quite desirable in the next 20 years. As cities expand. Basically the only way I'm going to be able to afford this is (not my idea actually). Is my parents are wanting to move in with my wife, and kids on this rural property. That being said I've been looking for properties with a good split, so we would have our own areas of the home to make it work.If I do sell my home.Between myself, and my parents we would be putting a hefty down payment on the home (20 to 30 percent). So that should technically bring my part of the mortgage down to about what I'm paying now.I've tossed up the idea of keeping my current property, and renting it out. The rental market is also crazy (nobody can afford these houses anymore). But I would lose the downpayment.

I was hired as a service techinician (servicing/installing bank equipment - locks, safes, pneumatic tube systems, burg/fire alarms, cctv, etc) and was promoted to Service Manager Jan 1 2018.I'm the third person to take (and now lose) this job since I've worked there - It's a small company of 6 employees, and the boss is a hothead and very hard to please. I knew this going in, but I figured for the money it was worth an attempt.I was making $19/hr hourly working full time before, changed to $50k/yr salary once I took the manager job.Today, I had a pretty bullshit ""6 month review"" - He sat me down and basically said, ""I don't think this is working, so I'm making you a tech again, I'll pay you $20/hr. Take the rest of today and tomorrow off, come Wednesday we'll get you rolling in the field again."" He has his reasons, and I don't disagree that there were challenges in working together - but nothing was ever documented on paper, I would just have to sit through angry outbursts once in a while every time he didn't like the way I did something. Most critically, I just took a $9000 dollar pay cut - having just purchased a car, and this puts a huge crunch on my finances. I'm going to spend some time today redoing my budget, and I already don't like how it's going to turn out.Here are my thoughts. If I stay here, that management experience withers away, and loses effectiveness on my resume the longer I continue as a technician.Going back to work there is going to be awkward. That much I can manage, but I see it causing some interpersonal drama now that I'm back working alongside 4 techs I was previously in charge of.Lastly, would this qualify as constructive dismissal? I understand that my job duties are changing as well as my pay - but this is an 18% pay cut that was decided unilaterally. Would I be better served declining it and accepting dismissal, trying to survive off of unemployment while searching for something in the vain of what I was previously doing?This is the first time something like this has happened to me, and while my head is spinning a little, I feel like I can make the best of the situation somehow - just need a little guidance.I appreciate in advance any advice you can offer - and if there are any questions you have for me I'm happy to answer them."

I'm appreciated and respected by everyone I work for.My pay rate has doubled in the 11 years since I started. We've gotten year end bonuses and raises all but one of these years.Up until a couple years ago, our insurance premiums were paid 100%. It's only $40 a month now. Cons: There is no ""promotion"", I would continue in this same position till I retired.Health insurance is OK, not great. Premiums for dependants are all on the employee and are ridiculously high.

9ozhqy	personalfinance	So this past week, my fiancee and I found a vehicle we though we would like to purchase for around $23,000 sticker price, and we were aiming to negotiate to around $20,000. The car was used, but only 11,000 miles, and was 6 years old. Research of the vehicle put its fair price at around 19 - 20 thousand. Combined we have enough income to easily cover the price of the auto loan if we financed for 72 Months at around a 5%-6% APR, with $1000 down. I know that we both have very good credit, anywhere from 750 upwards for both of us, however, its is not extensively established. My longest line of credit has been open for about 5 years, but is not continuously used, and my other lines are around the 2-3 year range, also not continuously used. Hers were even less. We have no current mortgages or other liabilities. I know my first mistake was relying on the dealer to work through financing for us, but when they ran our credit reports they expected us to take on a loan at 15% APR! Being a finance major getting ready to graduate, I knew this was absolutely ridiculous for an automobile loan, and was never going to accept a 15% APR, no matter what monthly payments were. I expected a much more reasonable rate seeing as I have excellent credit standing, even without 10 years or more of establishment.So I guess my question to all of you who have gone this before, how were you able to finance your automobile purchases? Does extensive established credit matter that much for an automobile loan? Why did our situation end up this way when we were trying to work out a deal?Thanks All!

9krx1p	personalfinance	Been watching this subreddit for awhile, finally decided to register and ask for guidance. I'm 41, and hoping I can somehow make a good life for myself after decades of bad decisions. Here is a little background, when in my 20's I spent most of my time going out and having fun. Wasn't career focused, spent my time at manual labor positions, not saving, and didn't think about retirement. Got married too young, had a son, and divorced. Continued to be immature and party until my early 30's. Credit score - 574. Decided I should grow up and be a man and focus on being a father. I started to take night classes for the IT field. Worked some entry level IT jobs to get experience and work my way up. Still, no retirement or savings and not making much of a wage.Fast forward to today, I'm 41. Credit score hovering around the high 690's - low 700's. Have been in the IT field for 7 years now. I make a good salary for my area, $70,000+. I do pay child support, but that'll be done in 4 years. I finally started a 401k, have been bumping up my contribution, and it is now at 10%. Still, I only have about $15,000 in it. I don't have any other retirement accounts, I know next to nothing about that stuff. I just blindly throw money at it, but can't help but feel I am so far behind in the game of life, like, what's the point at this age.Recently, I took a part-time job, just to pay off credit card debt. I don't have much, under 5 grand. Just want to be debt free, maybe put extra in retirement, or savings... I don't know.Anyone have any advise, is it possible for someone like me, who has been a fuck up for a majority of my life, to possibly rebound and enjoy a retirement? I feel like all I do right now is bust my ass every single day to be the best I can be, but it is too late. Feel like I'll be 70 and still be working multiple jobs dreaming of retirement.

e7rgqw	personalfinance	"The situation: I am 27 years old and a father of two living in a flourishing city booming with tourists as well as the wealthy flooding in and scooping up property rapidly causing the property values to skyrocket. More to the point, I have gotten divorced this past year and this have led me down a destructive path of poor financial and personal decisions.  Well, I'm no longer making excuses for it and have to face the harsh consequences of the decisions I've made.  I had left my stable job and while I don't blame her for me quitting the job, I was mentally unstable at the time because her new flame was scooped up at my job, which consequently was/is also her workplace. Taking a massive pay cut whilst also making my financial duties more taxing and heftier. I have had to start over on my own with no vehicle or home of my own as I felt it the right thing to do as I'm rebuilding to leave her the car and condo for my children's sake. I then moved in with family while recuperating until they moved quite far away. I didnt really have much time to get stable and am far from it, thankfully, I was able to buy my own car without acrueing new debt. However it's falling apart by the hour and will need to be addressed soon. My current living situation is I am living in a hotel room, which is crippling  my finances. Homelessness is not an option. Mostly because my mom's not well and and can no longer help with money. Now, I make roughly 400-475 a week and the bill for each week of having this crummy roof over my head is 375. Not leaving much leftover after feeding ourselves and keeping gas in the car,  I only buy enough to get back and forth to work and occasionally visiting my kids on weekends.  On top of that essential toiletries and cellphone to keep in touch with the children. I will need to change my carrier or plan cuz I cant catch up. 20$ here, 40 there just to keep service. Sometimes skipping out on laundry to save and washing clothes in the sink and leaving them out to air dry. Beyond that only very small expenses. I have been contracting out for work since the separation because of the immediate need to get income flowing in. Some of the jobs havent worked out or my contract has been fulfilled and it's a revolving door sending me right back to the temp service. Missing single day is not an option and my pay is very baseline. Nobody is offering up any help and holidays without pay cause a snowballing of my weekly room bill along with late fees. I am looking for another job on top of my day job and am having no luck thus far. Not to mention the debt of one totaled vehicle, another one I cosigned for (Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!) And old debt I accrued with my ex. Coming to a total of somewhere about 50k.(Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!). I'm also having extreme difficulty find a rental property so I can  save some of money that hemorrhaging on the hotel room. And if I do I have extremely bad credit. Can't afford insurance nor could I fix the broken headlight on my car. So when i was pulled over I had my license suspended, adding to the list of urgent financial duties. Any advice can't hurt. Thanks for reading this short novel I'm calling, ""Tales from my pathetic existence"".  Don't look it up, it was a joke. Unless  of course you think I could get something published.

e2ur18	personalfinance	My boyfriend and I recently started dating ~3 months but we have been friends for about 2 years.I live in SF, which is notoriously expensive, and he lives with his parents and doesn’t pay rent. He stays with me about 6/7 nights out of the week because we like to spend time together but also because it cuts his commute in half. We really enjoy spending time together but it is starting to bother me that he doesn’t pay rent. He does take me out to eat and splits most groceries with me. But all other things (ex. Laundry, cleaning supplies, shower supplies) that we share, I pay for so a lot of things run out twice as fast like laundry detergent and soap and I also pay all the rent. Right now, he has about half a drawer and puts a few clothes in my closet but the space isn’t really his. Of course if he paid rent, I would be more willing to split the space more as well. Additionally, he makes more money than I do. I currently make around $75k and he makes around $100k+.We don’t really want to solidify and “move in together” I mean it’s only been 3 months BUT he already stays with me almost every night.

I make 75k a year so and I live rent free, so making a $871 a month wasnt bad. I have always saw houses as good investment, so recently i saw a really house that was going on sale and I was 100% into it once I saw it duing open house.

I was doing the math and mortgage calculators online I relized that my high monthly payment on the car is literally stopping me from affording it. I have a pretty good credit score (750) My first thought was to call my bank and ask if I can refinance the car to lower the car payment but reading online, people have said that taking a new loan is just going to damage your credit score and you may not even be able to get 250k from a lender.

8srppa	personalfinance	Hi all,I'm 27, single and stable at my current job. Currently renting a room in a modest beach house. I recently inherited about 110k in cash and I am toying with the idea of buying a property that has two smaller (sub 1k sqft each) houses on it. Currently they are a little dumpy but with some money and effort I think that they can both be pretty solid rentals that are two blocks from the one of the more desirable beaches in my area (they are 2 houses away from the flood line, I will not need flood insurance).It's kind of a weird situation, in that zoning only allows for the property to be sold with both houses and they cannot be split up. Listing price is 190k, both houses need carpets and tile ripped up, the hardwood floors redone and fresh paint at the absolute minimum. One may have a bad roof, one is more recent. I would likely try to knock out as many of the smaller potential problematic items that could cause headaches down the road prior to having tenants in the houses as well.I feel as though this could be a great opportunity to either live in one of the houses and rent the other house out, with their rent covering my mortgage for a few years, then down the road have both units rented out in hopes of a source of passive income. I am comfortable putting enough money down (20%+) that the rent received from one unit would cover the entire mortgage, property taxes and insurance so I'd only be covering it out of pocket if lived in one of the units and did not have tenants in the other unit, or if I did not live in either unit and had no tenants in either unit, which I don't think is too much of a stretch with my current income (one unit occupied would cover both units).What are you guys thoughts on this situation with my current income?

After doing some research it seems that all U.S banks have to use an intermediary bank for international transfers? Can anyone confirm this? Are there any U.S banks that receive international wires directly with no intermediary?  The only other option the law firm has given me is to have a bank draft couriered to me. This scares me for two reasons:  1. What happens if the bank draft goes missing en route? Does all that money just disappear with it?2.

One being, by putting the same amount of money towards our mortgage as we would in the 529 we can pay off our house in about 13 years where my oldest will be just about to get to enter college and our youngest will be a few years behind. We can then pay college bills out of pocket or worst case take out a HELOC. We also don’t know what college will be in 14 years and could be more online based which would lower overall costs.It seems like a no brainer but I feel like I am missing something. The amount we will save in interest alone by knocking off 15yrs of our mortgage will almost pay for a few years of college.

brc55x	personalfinance	"So, my parents (who are getting divorced soon) have flipped a couple of multi-family houses before and are in the process of buying a $665k house which they want to ""put in our name"". After a lot of hesitation I said yes, but after reading all the loan documents and everything I'm getting some really bad vibes about this. First of all, my brother and I would be the cosigners on the mortgage (30 years) for this house and I **know** both my parents have pretty bad credit, so I wouldn't put it past them to somehow miss a payment or something on this house. For reference, my credit score is about 770, my brothers is close to 700  I think (or maybe slightly higher now), my mom's is around 640-650, and my dads is either close to my moms or a bit closer to 610. It's also worth mentioning to me that my dad has asked me before (a few months ago) to cosign a car loan for him because he couldn't get approved at the rate he wanted... so yeah, that doesn't make my confidence go up about this whole thing either.Anyway... when I've questioned them on why I need to put this in my name/cosign it, they've said it's because when they rent it out to people, my brother and I will get some of the money (they said $400-500/month) from it to help pay off our school loans. I love my parents and they've been nothing more than supportive/helpful/caring my entire life, but this just seems like a very bad idea to me... especially for only an additional $500/month which would be nice, but not nice enough to make me feel comfortable doing this.I'm planning on moving out of my house with my boyfriend in a few months and I'm worried this will make it nearly impossible for me to get approved for an apartment or home of our own (although that's likely at least 2-4 years away).If anyone could give me some advice that would be super helpful."

behop5	personalfinance	I'm considering first time buying a house here in southern California because rent prices are fucking ridiculous.  We rent a 1 bed apartment for just over $1400 and the potential house is 3bed and would come out to $1250 a month.  Other than the usual fears of doing a major purchase and not having a clue about home buying, I'm specifically terrified about the near future of the economy.  I have been hearing whispers and other implications that we are very nearly due (or even past due) for the next housing market recession (or recession in general).  Is it currently considered a bad time to buy a house? I'm terrified the market will dive and the house will tank in value a year after we buy it.  It might also be worth mentioning that we don't hope to be here in California for very much longer. Maybe 2-3 years.  My SO thinks we'll just sell the house then and move.  My instinct tells me that buying a house to live in for only 2-3 and then hoping to sell it isn't realistic or maybe wise?TL:DR My SO wants to buy a house because mortgage would be cheaper than rent, but we are hoping to move out of state in the next couple years.  Is that wise or unwise? And is the current market a BAD time to buy (is it expected to drop?)ANY advice about this would be greatly appreciated.

at2j2l	personalfinance	I don't even know where to start... I am at a really low point in my life. Which is saying a lot!! Well to start maybe a little background. I am a recovering Heroin addict and I have been sober for over two years. I know I will probably get a lot of negative responses from just that alone but it's fine. So in the past two years I had completely rebuilt my life. I went to a sober living home for 8 months, during that time I saved, bought a car, and got my own place. It was extremely hard learning how to do all of that for what was basically the first time in my life but I managed really well. I had a nice little set up for myself that I was very proud of. Well in the past two months my life has been completely turned upside down. It started with the transmission going out in my car. Being that I worked a minimum wage job I certainly had no savings to get it fixed. So it got repossesed. After that things went down hill a lot faster. I was relying on friends I had made through work to help me when they could for rides to work and I would walk to the store if needed. My former employer knew my situation so when rides fell through they were pretty understanding but eventually they had to let me go. Which I am not mad at them at all and I understand completely. Needless to say I was evicted shortly after that. Luckily my mother has let me sleep on her couch for right now. She works two jobs to provide for herself and my younger siblings and barely gets by as it is so she really doesn't need the extra stress of me being here. She definitely can not help with transportation to a job. My other family hasn't quite forgiven me for the wreckage of my past (and I don't blame them) so I have no outside help at all. I feel very stuck right now and I have no idea how to get out of this hole I am in. I had help the first time around from the sober living program I was in. I had thought about that as well and it is a place for people fresh in recovery so that is not an option. I know all of this is of my own making and I should have had my life together a long time ago.I just need all of the advice I can get right now. Where can I start? Are there places willing to help that I am unaware of? I really don't know at this point. I just know that I need to get off of my mothers couch and get it together.

ca14wp	personalfinance	Hi all, I’ve been following here for a long time and I need some advice. Here’s my story- I am currently going to school part time this summer before I start Nursing in the Fall. The school I attend is a 20 min drive and I have to make that 4x a week. I currently work in a medical office full time (till the Fall) and make about $2200 a month. I recently found out I can’t keep my position while doing school and I’ll be switching to an on call/part time nursing support job that’ll give me the flexibility I need while in nursing school, but will be a big pay cut since I won’t be working 40 hours at the same rate any longer ($16 hr currently). I was told my other position will probably only be around $13hr and anywhere between 8-30hrs depending on what I can work. I’m also living at home while I get on my feet but I have a lot of credit card debt from a few years ago that I haven’t paid off. Because I don’t make much I haven’t been able to pay it off as originally planned. Several years ago I worked in sales and was flourishing financially, but depression and overall unhappiness in that line of work pushed me out of that field. So all the spoils of that lifestyle are haunting me...mainly my high car payment and the monthly payments I’m making on the cards. I have a SMALL amount of financial aid and student loans saved, about $1800 now and $1500 during the Fall semester. I was hoping those would be a buffer for the expense of driving to class 4x a week and supplementing my pay cut but I’m feeling like I’m about to drown right as I’m on the cusp of accomplishing this huge goal. The icing on the cake is that about 10 years ago I wasted 3 years in college at a university not knowing what I wanted to do and now I’m maxed out on loans. Probably about $50k. I get enough in financial aid awards to cover my tuition, but nothing is left over. I cringe typing this...I’m embarrassed and ashamed. Now I’m at the point where i can’t take out anymore student loans and I have to ask myself, do I let the car go...get something cheap? Do I stop making payments on the cards? I’ve always made my payments on time! Never been late. My credit score is pretty good actually! Probably lower now than ever but has always been in the 700s. I figure I could let my credit suffer for now and work on fixing it when I’m out of school, but I don’t know if that’s the smartest choice. I’m a single Mom and I want nothing more than to give my child every opportunity she deserves. Right now my Family is helping in every way they can and I feel terrible...I’ve gotten myself into a bind but I’m not giving up on my career.  Right now I have about 4 cards I pay on which equal about $450/mo and my vehicle payment is $695/mo. The only other expenses I have since I’m living with my Family are gas, food and things here and there for my child.

My reasoning is it seems like a no-brainer if you can withdrawal your contribution plus the interest with no penalty or taxes for a first time home buyer.

They recently flagged my account for fraud (although there were no fraudulent charges).  To clear the account they want copies of Nevada DL and SS card emailed to confirm my identity. I am not comfortable sending a credit card company hard copies of my SS card.  So I sent my DL and redacted the number.  They would not accept stating needing front AND back and number of DL.  Next I emailed them a copy of my Passport, copy of DL with numbers redacted, and a copy of my SS card with first five numbers redacted.  They would not accept. Next I had an ""Affidavit of Identity"" notarized which included the numbers for my Passport, DL, and SS card.  I mailed (snail mail) the original to Cap One.  They would not accept.  When I asked why they would not accept a legal notarized document, the manager's response was ""we have the right to ask for SS card due to the Patriot Act"" and ""anyone can become a notary"".  After all this I requested to close the account.  They will not close the account without a copy of my Soc Sec Card.  The Fraud Dept manager informed me the account would remain in ""suspended"" state indefinitely.  Furthermore I would be responsible for paying the yearly account fees of $39 even though I cannot use the account....or close it. In addition, they also have $95 in cash back rewards that is also ""suspended"".Last week on 1/4 I paid the remaining balance in full.  However, two days ago they charged the yearly fee of $39.

8q1zmj	personalfinance	"Hey everyone! Sorry if this totally isn't the right place for this but I couldn't think of a better subreddit to ask this question. The title is a bit hyperbolic but I'm really at the end of my rope. I'm 24 and feel like I'm trapped in my home. Here's kinda how things went:I was a pretty stellar student until about my sophomore year of highschool. My sophomore year, my parents decided to get into daily yelling matches. Call me a pussy, I'm fine with that, but this absolutely was not the norm for 99% of my life up to that point. It shook me up big time.Starting my sophomore year, my grades began to plummet. I was terrified at school worrying about what I might come home to. I thought about trying to get my license and trying to find a job just to be out of the house as well as having spending cash. My dad would kinda do the whole ""Oh well it can wait."" Blah blah blah. Fine. Whatever. I had ALWAYS planned on taking a break after highschool. I needed it. So after my grades plummeted, I was able to get my ass in gear to focus on schooling again. I graduated and was pretty happy. But the stresses of my parents fighting constantly for 3 years was just too much.To make things worse, my mom had to quit her job because she lost a leg to a random blood clot.Well of course, my dad started hammering me on getting a job. The issue is that he owns a furniture repair business. He REALLY wanted to force me to work for him. For free. The idea being that he feeds me and houses me and all that. I get it. But I dunno it felt a bit ridiculous. He used to HIRE someone else to do all of that. These are things I'm fairly certain you can pass off onto customers OR the new opening in work load can allow you to take on more business I would think. Of course, I didn't look too far into it so I could be way off. It seems like, now, he's constantly gating me off of improving myself. I want to get a job, get a license and improve myself. But every time I bring it up, my dad gates it behind the idea of like ""Why work for someone else when you can work for me and take over the business?"" or ""As soon as you get a job I'm gonna expect you to start paying rent and stuff."" It's not that I think the paying rent is unreasonable but if that's the case, I'd rather just have my own place. It'd prevent drama and arguments over things. I don't use tv in my house for example so paying for cable would be a waste of money.I thought about doing Job Corps but I'm not totally convinced it's the best route for me yet. I still have several months to decide on that anyways if I've exhausted all other options. I feel like my biggest struggle in life is finding the route to get started. I think I'm responsible and focused enough that once I get going, I can manage myself really easily but I have NO CLUE how to actually get going.I feel like one of the first questions I'm going to get is ""Well why aren't you just applying everywhere?"" I have been. I've sent out about 8 in person resumes and about 20 online resumes. No call backs. I feel like I have A LOT of skills related to computers, typing, programming, some design work and things like that but I don't know where to go from here. Any guidance would be helpful. My goal is to get a job, get out, and continue to focus on learning programming in hopes to improve that way.Where do I begin?

I got my first request for interview yesterday and I asked for a phone interview, which the hiring manager declined. I'm not 100% sure it'll be the best fit for me, but I'm trying to be conscious of not using too much time to interview. Not so much from a moral standpoint, but more in terms of how little PTO I have, and how difficult it is to use. At this point, if I use any more after my interview next week (for which I took half a day, called it a doctors appt.) I'll go into debt with the company for time. If iI do end up taking a new job, I'll have to pay that back when I leave if I haven't accrued it yet. That's not a huge deal for a few hours, but if I'm interviewing with 3-5 companies, I can see a lot of time going into it.

I have 2 years of experience as a sysadmin and before that I used to work as a developer. I honestly don’t know how long I have been coding, I started coding in university but my degree is in unrelated field. I probably have been coding since 2011 or 2012. So few months ago my company accidentally leaked document which implies that they are planning to close branch I’m working at. They have been closing smaller branches for past year or so. A third (!!!) of people already have gotten notices and either have been fired or will be fired until end of the year. I’m safe for next 6 months or so… Needless to say I have been looking for a new job for a while now. First I even tried to write down every company I’ve applied to in a spreadsheet but I gave up on it. At this point I have applied for over 100 positions. I have tailored both my CV and my CL for those positions. What frustrated me is that a lot of them have unrealistic requirements, like 5+ years of experience with dozens of technologies for a JUNIOR position. Of course for a junior salary. What’s more I’m feeling betrayed in my current job. A while ago I realized that my company doesn’t give a flying fuck about employees. Most of my peers make more than I do, even juniors make more. One of my managers admitted (when we were out drinking) that I don’t make more because of my lack of social skills... Well, that's how his manager justified not increasing my salary. Right now it seems like company is wanting for us to quite. All overtime has to be pre-approved by someone waaaaay up in management chain. Due to ‘budget reasons” and they have implied that we should not expect any salary increased anytime soon.   At this point I just like a complete failure. At first I even tried to write down all positions I was applying for and how long it took them to respond. I gave up after first 50 or so...

Then I couldn't see the text that was on the RAM stick, so I spent 5 minutes trying to remove it. I looked at it, and put it back. I then powered the pc on, and heard beeping tune. I turned the pc off, unplugged it, opened it up, and checked the ram. It was in the wrong way. I quickly corrected that, plugged my pc in, and turned it on. Everything works except my monitor. It's not completely urgent, as I don't use my pc as often as most people here, but I'd like it restored as soon as possible.

I have a terrible history of not having any friends, aside from those who were just looking for sex, and I think my lack of my own personality just stems from that need to belong somewhere, and how I try to fix it by belonging anywhere.  My counselor and I have both noticed that I have no clue who I am, and I just become whoever I am in a romantic relationship with at the time. Now I am married, and so finally I have been the ""same person"" for a while, but it still causes a problem whenever I am away from my husband, because I feel like an empty shell, and although I don't outwardly show it (it's looked down upon as ""clingy"") I feel panicky like a dog without its master.

8vbsaa	legaladvice	This happened in Boston. My friends and I (4 women) were coming back from the bar at closing time. One of us was being kind of loud and obnoxious, but the rest of us were fine. While on the trip, I noticed that there was a display screen next to the rear view mirror showing both what was happening in front of the car and the passengers inside. I told the driver that this made me extremely uncomfortable. He claimed that it was legal because 1) he had posted signs and 2) it didn't record audio. There was a sign he had made on the side window next to us about no smoking, eating etc. that included a notice about audio and video recording in progress. But I  hadn't noticed it and it was hard to read at night. I told him I was a law student (not in MA) and that it made me very uncomfortable. He claimed it was for his own protection. The rest of the ride was basically an argument and at the end he told us to get the fuck out of his car. Am I right, that his camera is illegal? I don't like being recorded by strange men like that.

8vm0a1	Advice	Hey, I’m 19 and a half and I’ve been out of high school since 2016. I haven’t started college yet, mostly because I can’t decide what to do. But now I’ve kind of narrowed down my options and the people I know aren’t really willing to let me know, since they want me to figure it out myself. So I used to do this thing called Mock Trial in middle school and high school. To say I was good at it was an understatement and I have several state championships under my belt. I really enjoyed it too. Which leads me to my options.1. I’ve got a job at a big box grocery store (one of the classier ones, ahaha) and I totally feel like if I went for it, I’d be able to make a career out of it, without having to go to school. This is tempting because I really hate school but obviously the money isn’t great 2. I could become a paralegal. This ties in to the fact that I like law, and don’t like school. It only requires an associates degree. 3. An attorney. Obviously  this requires wayyy more school than the others. I don’t doubt I’m bright enough to do it, but I don’t want to get 3 years into my bachelors and decide I want to do something else and then spend more money on school. But it wouldn’t be worth it if I didn’t get top of my class.  (as many people know there are more lawyers than there are job openings for them)My family is lower middle class, I have no college savings but we don’t qualify for a lot of grants because we don’t suffer. I will probably have to take out more loans than someone who grew up poor due to grants (I’m not mad about this, I understand why it’s done this way, I’m just  taking the brunt of it.)

8yb80r	Advice	Over the last 18 months my life has somewhat imploded. Our dog (only 2 years old) had a series of unforeseen medical problems that have resulted in a lot of stress. Currently he’s being kept alive by a load of medication, a state that I don’t agree with but my mother refuses to put him down as to her ‘a life is a life’. But seeing him in the constant lethargic state instead of the energetic puppy I knew is desperately sad to me and it’s something beyond my control.I had a 6 year relationship that ended 5 months ago as I discovered my boyfriend had started another relationship behind my back, and eventually when confronted he chose her over me. To go from a promise of moving in together and an imminent engagement to having the life I thought I would have being ripped away is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. I’m getting better, but the pain does still rear its head.The most stressful thing however, is my father. He is extremely mentally unwell with what consultants believe is paranoid schizophrenia, however he refuses to accept any treatment. He has been kicked out of the home as he has become aggressive and erratic, and that behaviour has become directed at us. We have been placed on a police victim list (meaning we have a dedicated worker as they feel there is a real threat of harm), and my father has taken to stalking myself and other members of the family and sending threats of physical harm to us or himself. This often happens in the middle of the night and the constant looking over my shoulder and worry for him as a human being means that I’ve fallen into a deep state of anxiety. We’re working with the police to hopefully get him arrested and assessed with the ultimate aim for him to be committed in a mental institution for treatment even if it is against his will. There's just a lot of bureaucracy involved so the process is slow.The culmination of these things have spun me into terrible anxiety and near depression. My sleep habits have become poor and I’ve lost a ton of weight due to the stress. I look terrible and often I feel like I’m present in life but not ‘really there’. Unsurprisingly this has bled over into my work life.I go in and perform my duties, I think it peaks and troughs on whether I’m having a good day or a bad day, but I know my performance has been patchy. The main issue though is that my work places emphasis on joining in with ‘office culture’ and being friendly to everyone, apart from a guy my own age who knows about my problems, I’m not particularly friendly with any of them. I’m nice of course, but when they’re laughing and joking with each other I feel like I’m outside looking in as I can’t bring myself to ‘snap out of my funk’ so to speak. It's like I'm watching these happy interactions but my own mind is fogged and I can't think of what to say even if I wanted to join the conversation. I’ve heard in bits and pieces that my boss isn’t too keen on me for this reason, and I can tell that along with some others she doesn’t particularly care for me at all. I will say that the people I am friendlier with seem quite fond of me, but those who I’m disconnected from seem to have little positive feelings towards me. I know this is my own fault for letting my situation get the best of me and I deeply regret that this is the situation and it does make me uncomfortable knowing that people don't particularly like me.My appraisal is coming up in two weeks and at the bottom there is the obligatory box for ‘is there anything else you’d like to discuss’. I’m debating whether to request a brief conversation regarding my personal circumstances to assuage the feelings around it and give them confidence that I’ll make steps to try harder in future. But I know there seems to be a stigma around divulging this type of information at work, so I’m unsure. Is this something that I should bring up do you think, even if it’s just to acknowledge it? I know my boss and others are aware of bits and pieces, but I don’t think they know how deeply it has affected me or how serious it is. Things are finally starting to look up and I’m feeling happier than I’ve been in a long time but I feel stuck in this awkward rut I've created for myself. I’d very much like to be part of the office culture as we are a small team of about 20 people, but I’m wondering if it’s too late to explain and try again. Especially where these situations have been going on for a long time it might be a case of there’s no point in mentioning it as people are too set in their opinions. I’m not in danger of losing my job, but just to increase my happiness at work I’m wondering if it’s a good idea? Would my boss sympathise and understand me a little better? And what could I even say that would remain appropriate for a work environment even if it is a very casual one?

8zog29	personalfinance	Throwaway because I don't like to let most folks know about my financial situation.As the title says, I'm 25 years old, and inherited a large sum from my grandfather when he passed away. He passed when I was around 9 years old, and to my understanding, the account was somewhere in the $500k range at the time. By the time I gained control of it, it was just over $700k. Since then, I've used this to pay for two years of community college, a surgery, a reliable car, and a 20% down payment on a modest house. I've also been living off of it, almost entirely. The only other income I make is on my own attempt at starting a small business, which, in all honesty, only makes me a couple hundred bucks a month. The money has been in an Edward Jones stock account for years, and I left it there when I gained control of it. To my understanding, they have it in some sort of diverse stock portfolio, where they automatically move things around based on the level of risk I decide on each year. It's at a low-moderate risk right now. I have about $105k in a single account, and about $310k in an IRA. Thing is, I know... nothing about money. My parents never taught me anything about finances, even knowing what I was sitting on for 15 years, and I guess I just never knew where to start in learning. I know that's almost entirely my fault, but now I just have no idea where to start. I feel embarrassed asking my Edward Jones rep, because I've been sort of trying to pretend I know what he's talking about for four years. He seems like a good financial advisor and he seems to have the best interest in mind for my money (probably because the more I make, the more he makes), but I've just been blindly trusting that he's doing the right thing for years.The money has been sitting steady at $415k since I purchased my home, which was in November of last year. I take out $2,500 per month for living costs, and the accounts gain enough that it stays even. However, I know this money has the potential to gain a lot more, but I feel clueless on how to make better use of it. I don't want to end up slowly dwindling it down to nothing before I'm even 40.

Mind you he has worked all these years and in the process lost 1 home to bankruptcy another home to foreclosure and doesn't own the property his business sits in cause he took a loan against it.

93gycl	legaladvice	I am currently enrolled in a summer class at a small state school here in the state of Kansas. It's a sociology course, and we had a class earlier this week that was in regards to hate speech. We frequently have similar conversations where students are able to express their opinions on different topics and in many cases these topics are relevant political issues in today's news. Usually I am quiet, but as a supporter of freedom of speech I was pretty attentive to this one, because it was about racism and hate speech. A student got up and basically it should be against the law to say words like the N word and other things if you aren't apart of that race. After that I then said my opinion which was essentially being a free speech absolutist. We had a back and forth completely non threatening in any way and I didn't raise my voice at all or make any movements or anything. Eventually I started asking what words were and weren't okay. This was in an attempt to show how ridiculous this could be. I said and used examples and said them these words were Honky, Coon, Wet Back, Bitch, Chink, Uncle Tom just to name a few although I don't know how many others I used (Not many). That was pretty much the end of the discussion some people were clearly uncomfortable, but I honestly didn't care. I didn't use any of these words to refer to other students, or in a demeaning way. I was just asking about what words were okay and what ones weren't. This was yesterday morning when this class took place. I am supposed to have class again tomorrow, however I got an email from my instructor saying she had gotten contacted by a number of students who said they were uncomfortable with the language I used, and she doesn't think I should attend class anymore. She also stated that she had set up a meeting with me, her, and her boss (I believe the dean) about how to move forward from here. She told me she could kick me out of class if that was necessary. This class is just about over. The final is next week. I think this is unfair, and I would argue illegal. I plan on attending class tomorrow, and I've called my boss to tell her I will be late because of the meeting. If they continue with the threats of kicking me out of the class should I call a lawyer?  Should I try to get one to be present at this meeting? Should I at least record this meeting?

95u09v	personalfinance	"Hey all, I'm a 19 yo who just started his swim into the great world of adulting and I want to swim out to the open waters and settle down in another reef, so to speak.A bit of backgound info about me:My credit history runs for just over a year now, with a total of 5 accounts (4 credit cards, 2 of which are retail, and a Self Lender credit builder account). My current scores hover around the 720-730 range. I follow religiously by the 30% rule, and I don't have any derogatory accounts, no major debts nor am I in danger of going into collections. I also have a total revolving credit limit of $7,000 (split 50/50 between the two retail cards and my two general cards). The self lender account is a $545 loan locked in a CD until 11 months from now.My family came from the Philippines and I am a first generation child here in America. Because of this, I don't have the sort of $10k lying around from Mom's investments accounts or whatever the story may be. We manage to get by with a little wiggle room for luxuries. That being said, communication with my parents isn't the best, which will come to play later.As of right now, I'm currently working a retail job, with a annual gross pay of roughly $19k, given my current wage and average hours. I have just under $2,000 stashed away in savings. I recently started investing with Stash, but I don't expect to see any huge gains until I'm in my early mid 30s and I've got actual money to invest and not get mere penny returns. Currently, I have regular monthly payments of roughly $210, for my phone bill, public transport and the self lender account.So here's my situation:I want to move to an entirely different state. I'm currently in Hawaii, looking for an apartment and roommates in the SF Bay area or an outlying city, with the plan to have a lease signed and have at least one roommate by the end of the year. I want to move for both personal reasons, and for career/school reasons. I currently am not in school, and I don't plan on returning until I settle in (or have my dreams of moving completely shut down), so I have time to focus on getting me the sweet cash money. I have thought about just dorming for the moment while I plan out a more permanent move plan, but I don't want the burden of student loans bringing me down in the future.Because I'm a first generation American, there's quite a bit of culture differences between how my mom and I see things, and communication is shaky a lot of times (I live with my mom and step father, both from the Philippines, and my step father is an ass so he won't be involved). I have expressed this need to fly out of the nest; both to grow as a person, and in pursuit of a potential career. But due to the general lack of funds and shaky communication, I don't expect much financial help from my mom. Though she is willing to help, she won't be able to contribute much in the way of finance, nor is she a source of guidance for me (sorry mom! Love you, but your comments of ""how come you wanna move"" and ""don't you know it's expensive"" without really... guiding me isn't going to help). With all that being said, quick recap:* Young adult want to move from Hawaii to SF Bay Area at end of year* Good credit, but relatively low funds saved* Not expecting a lot of financial help from parentsI know my situation isn't all that great, and I know y'all are gonna tell me to sit back down and wait until I'm more established financially, but I'm not willing to give up on this plan without a fight, so please humor me.

I decided to wait until the court date to take further action so I could get an exact dollar amount on how much the ticket would cost and then maybe request and extension and try to fight it. I went to court and they said they officer hadn’t put the ticket in yet and that he has a full YEAR to do so and it is my responsibility to keep checking every week to see if it’s in and then showing him my proof of coming into court. This is ridiculous I just want to get the ticket solved and over with. I get the police is busy but this is the way the make money shouldn’t they be promt about this.

9d03up	personalfinance	Hi everyone - I'm 50 years old and have about half a mill in my retirement savings with probably another 8k in other retirement accounts.  I have another 10k in my HSA and 22k in a bank savings account.  SSA.gov predicts I'll get 1500 or so monthly, and I might inherit some money as well.  These are my only assets - I have no house and my car is worth a few thousand at best.  I have zero debt.  I worked as a registered nurse for 25 years and left due to burnout.  Originally I was going to take a year off but it's going on two.  I am working as a package handler which takes care of the few expenses I have (I live with my elderly parents) and provides excellent health insurance, but of course I haven't put anything in my retirement since I started.  I probably will go back to nursing eventually but it will be on a part-time basis, both to take care of my parents and because being a nurse is very difficult.  Am I on track for retirement even if never put another dime in?  I live very frugally but I don't want to be a burden to my daughter.  Also, what should I do with my 22k?

9gzh87	personalfinance	Long story short, I work in a cozy office for a University. I am on a team managed by one woman. Last week I made a couple mistakes in my work and things weren't really going my way. I noticed that my boss started to act passive-aggressively towards me: Not saying hello in the morning or making eye contact when I try to talk to her, trying to do my work ahead of me having a chance to get to it, piling on work asking “Where do things stand with this” and adding short turn-around deadlines—basically setting me up for failure. After a couple days, I had enough. Late into an afternoon I walked into her office and asked if I could speak to her. I came off entirely unaggressive and said something to the effect of “I’m not really happy with the way things have been going and it’s making me a bit upset. I don’t think I’ve been quite as effective as a could be, and I would like your help to improve” to which she says something to the effect of “I agree you haven’t been doing well” and nothing more.  She let the conversation die and I stared at her, eventually saying “well I hope I can find a way to improve” and I walk out.This week I had hoped her attitude would be a bit better but she is no different. She continues to ignore me while socializing with other team members. Today, we all had planned 1:1 meetings with her. She ran a bit late on the first one then had the second one. I was suppose to be third in line at 3:00pm. The 2nd meeting got out a little late so I sent her an instant message “if you are tired and would like to reschedule for tomorrow, that is okay with me”. She didn’t respond, and instead hosted the final 4th meeting. She then rescheduled my meeting until tomorrow.Now I am a bit annoyed. I have a cool and calm composure and I can handle a little tension—that’s fine but this is just petty. She is blantly going out of her way to passively toy with me and is ignoring me from a professional standpoint. I am still a solid performer, I know I am. I churn work all day and I try my hardest but she continues to act like this. I’ve considered bringing this to the manager above her, but this honestly does not bother me enough yet. I am not annoyed from a personal perspective but professional. How should I handle this situation?

They want me to finish my electrical engineering degree before putting me on any client jobs, which is more than understandable, so I dont really have any income from them. The problem is that school has left me \~$14,000 in debt, normally this wouldnt be an issue because of student loans, but my bank (and all I've looked into) dont offer student loans for students attending 2 year colleges. Here's the *real* problem: My first account of borrowing for school was when I went to a program through my community college at PSU for a nanotechnology degree. Here I borrowed \~$6,000. My banker told me to put it on my credit card (I know, red flag) so that I could come in at a later time and not borrow more than I need; A big fuck no went off in my head, but I'd been banking with him through my adolescence - present and didn't think he would do me wrong, also my dad went to the bank with me and he wasn't really phased.After placing that and my next semester on my credit card I went in to transfer my debt to a loan. Well, even after having an appropriate income, a good credit score (\~750) and working with them for the entirety of my life, they denied me a personal loan due to ""not enough credit history"". At this point my banker that I trusted gave me some sketchy af options, so I dont think I'll be working with him again. So basically I need a way to keep my head above water until I start working on client jobs in a year. I'm working part time to pay bills, but my finances are staying stagnant. I dont care if I rack up $100,000 in debt, I just really need help getting it off my cc. Thanks for helping, it means more than you think&amp;#x200B;For anyone who is interested in the options my banker told me* Get new credit card with 0%APR and roll credit onto that, rinse and repeat until I start my job* Shop around* Get fucked an die (Obviously he didnt say this, but thats how it felt)"	TIME	How did you get into this situation?	<RESPONSE_TIME_1_AUTHOR>	How did you get into this situation in the first place?	<RESPONSE_TIME_0_AUTHOR>	author_token_model
9jelvh	personalfinance	Hi, longtime lurker, though I seldom post. I recently interviewed for a job at a company that is a closer commute to my home than my current position, and I would end up making substantially more money. As this is my first job after getting a couple years of experience on my resume. However I have an acquaintance who held this position in 2013, at the time he would’ve had a year less experience than I do now when he was hired in. As his base pay he received  $72,000, in my offer letter they are offering me 60,000. Are they lowballing me because it is expected that in this day and age people negotiate a higher wage? I mean on the one hand I’d be making way more than I am now, so am I crazy to even be complaining about it. But if I settle for a lower start pay it would be years before I even reach the other amount let alone even higher. I guess I’m just nervous about trying to bargain for better pay and get the offer rescinded. And even though it’s a closer commute I’d still be commuting an hour and that adds up over time, could I include that as a reason for negotiating a better pay? I guess I am looking for people opinions on the matter and the best way to come off professionally when negotiating, as I’ve never done it before. Any help is appreciated!Ps. Glassdoor does not have a salary listed for this position for this company, but paysa does, but I’ve never heard of that site so I wasn’t sure how reliable it was.

I walked into the nearest dealership got a 13,000 Loan and drove off with a used 2016 Dodge Dart SXT. My monthly minimum payment is $247.00 at a 10% rate, it was the best I could find with no credit history on the insurance side I was looking at $184.27 for monthly full coverage insurance with a clean record. Fast forward to now I have been medically discharged from the military, starting school Oct 23, working 15 hours a week, making roughly $200 every two weeks  and I just found out today my insurance is doubling due to the state I live in. Now I am looking at my $247.00 car payment as well as my newly discovered $360 insurance bill. I have looked at other insurance companies and this is the best I can get, crazy to think that.I have absolutely no clue what to do, my classes start October 23rd and are 7:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. and I will work 5:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M.

9ohp1z	legaladvice	OK here is the long and the short of it. I was dating my former partner for 10 years up until this fall when our relationship went south. 3 years prior, we had purchased a to-be-built home in a new suburb. When we bought the home the money came from 3 sources mine, his, and his Aunts. His aunt was willing to help us out and was looking to invest some extra cash. The cost was split 3 ways divided like this mine=1/4, His=1/4, His Aunt= 1/2. All costs were split this way, except living costs (heat hydro ex.) those were split between me and my partner alone. Now we are selling the home but I’m facing one big issue, I don’t have any legal document saying I’m part owner of this home. I fear that if things turn more hostile between the ex and myself (fyi I’m not in any physical danger and I’m 100% safe) I might not have any legal right to part of the sale of this home. That cannot happen; I need this money for my own future. So my question is can someone point me in the right direction in terms of legal advice? Like what kind of lawyer would I need to talk to make sure I get what is mine? Edit: their names are on the deed.Any information would be super helpful.We live in Ontario Canada.

9ozhqy	personalfinance	So this past week, my fiancee and I found a vehicle we though we would like to purchase for around $23,000 sticker price, and we were aiming to negotiate to around $20,000. The car was used, but only 11,000 miles, and was 6 years old. Research of the vehicle put its fair price at around 19 - 20 thousand. Combined we have enough income to easily cover the price of the auto loan if we financed for 72 Months at around a 5%-6% APR, with $1000 down. I know that we both have very good credit, anywhere from 750 upwards for both of us, however, its is not extensively established. My longest line of credit has been open for about 5 years, but is not continuously used, and my other lines are around the 2-3 year range, also not continuously used. Hers were even less. We have no current mortgages or other liabilities. I know my first mistake was relying on the dealer to work through financing for us, but when they ran our credit reports they expected us to take on a loan at 15% APR! Being a finance major getting ready to graduate, I knew this was absolutely ridiculous for an automobile loan, and was never going to accept a 15% APR, no matter what monthly payments were. I expected a much more reasonable rate seeing as I have excellent credit standing, even without 10 years or more of establishment.So I guess my question to all of you who have gone this before, how were you able to finance your automobile purchases? Does extensive established credit matter that much for an automobile loan? Why did our situation end up this way when we were trying to work out a deal?Thanks All!

To this day it is the single  most nostalgic place on earth for myself and my two brothers (and is very likely the sole piece of inheritance we will ever get from my family). In 2012 the cabin was getting to be too much of a burden on my (then 84 year old) grandmother. She deeded the cabin over to my aunt (who was the one taking care of the property at the time) and her husband. My grandmother has told me several times over the years that she did so on the condition that my aunt put myself and my two brothers (the only grandchildren she has) as heirs in her (my aunt's) will.Sadly my aunt passed away last year. Her husband (who originally was married to her sister until they ran away together) says he never heard anything about passing the cabin to us and suspiciously can't find any will. My grandmother (now 90) calls him and tells him that the cabin is for her grandchildren. He basically tells her to F-off and is now selling the cabin fully intent on keeping all the money to himself.Is there anything I can do to fight this legally?

That's an awful lot of money for a student like me. On top of that, a good graphics card cost around 500-1000$. That just seems insane to me.

9wzuqo	personalfinance	My [24M] wife [23F] and I are just getting started with our careers, and we almost have all of our debt paid off. Our credit scores are great, and we could live off of my salary alone fine, but she will probably be making more than me starting in two years once she finishes law school and gets a job. We are both pretty risk averse, and I’ve always been leery of the way Americans buy a $400k house for a 30-year mortgage (pronounced “debt”) and then end up paying much more for that house over that time period. So, we have been talking about staying in our apartment for a couple years longer than originally planned and trying to buy a house... in cash. Even if not the whole thing, maybe putting like 60% down or more, and trying to have it paid off within four or five years. To me, it’s about cash flow and getting things paid off as quickly as possible so that if something were to happen to one of us (disability or illness, lose our job, etc), we wouldn’t be screwed and living in a bigger house than we can afford. I’m big on not having debt - it terrifies me.I told my friends about it and they thought it was a very dumb idea. They said I should put 20% down or so - however much is needed to get the lowest interest rates possible - and then invest the rest. They said I would get better returns through investing, and it hedges against the risk of your house burns down or property values plummet. I get that, but a) isn’t that what insurance is for, and b) the beauty of owning a house outright is that if the property values plummet and the economy tanks... we wouldn’t really care because we own that house. To me it still makes sense to try to buy a house in cash even if it isn’t the best “investment” decision.Thoughts?

9yrk4g	legaladvice	Location: NJ, USAHi, everyone. I recently made a few orders online at this outerwear company because they were having some crazy deals. The company is well known and popular. I used the browser extension Honey, which automatically applies coupon codes to your cart. I ended up getting items at around 10% of the retail price. I took screenshots of my receipts after ordering online just in case. I was originally charged on my credit card the amount that the receipt showed, which was the amount I agreed to pay. A few days later, the items were confirmed and shipped. In that shipping email, however, the price was different from what the website had shown me and what my screenshots show. I had a few orders, and each order had a different price increase, so it doesn’t really make sense. One of my orders went from $7 to $20, and another went from $40 to $500. At first, my credit card still had the pending charges of the original price, but when I checked this morning, they had posted higher. What should I do here? If I call the company and argue that since I have screenshots of my orders clearly showing the lower prices, should I be reimbursed? Will screenshots hold up? Can I call the bank and dispute it?Tldr: bought items online for a great deal, took screenshots of receipts on website. Was shipped those items, but then charged more than what I agreed to pay. What should I do?Thanks for reading.

a1rw81	personalfinance	Recently around September I purchased a fairly cheap used car.  The buy was sort of risky, so I decided to use the in house financing to lessen how much money I had tied up in the vehicle.  They do all the registration and DMV work in house, I drive the car home, and patiently wait for the bill.  I found out the car is in really good shape and doesn’t need as much work as I thought, and at this point I want to just pay the vehicle off.  Fast forward 2 months and I still have not received a bill.  The first time I called the bank was waiting on the dealer to submit the paperwork, the second time I called the bank needed a verification of address (guess the dealer forgot to get this?).  So I called the dealer and they said that they used my DMV records for that and that I should be receiving a bill soon.  Another 2 weeks passes, still nothing.  I don’t want to keep calling the bank because I’m scared that would be admitting fault for all of this.  What should I do?

a8ak9c	personalfinance	We've taken our daughter to a really well known gymnastics class starting when she was 5.  She started in the Kindergarten class there in the fall of 2017.  She's 6 now and moved up to their level 1 recreational class.  Its only an hour and a half, one time a week.  She loves it.  Its $100 a month.  She makes friends there, the coaches are great, she's learning a lot of self confidence and fitness, which are the primary reasons we wanted her there.  It was actually her idea to do gymnastics as opposed to Soccer or Dance or anything else that we showed her.  So, she's happy and the price and time commitment are reasonable.  &amp;#x200B;So, last night my wife and I were there watching out daughter and we started chatting with some other parents there.  Their daughters were 7 and 8.  One is on their competition team, the other is on the pre-competition team.  So, their time commitment is 2 weekdays of 3.5 hours, 4 hours on saturday and on top of that, they have to go to a dance school one night a week for the floor routine.  Time commitment aside, the one blurted out that its $3,000.  We're not sure if that is per quarter (which is what they bill, ours is $300/qtr), semi annual or annual.  We didn't wanna ask because our jaws were already on the floor.&amp;#x200B;Now, there is no guarantee that our daughter will even want to do that.  She might want to just stay on the recreational side and just have fun.  But holy shit!!!!!!  That cost is astronomical, as i'd lean that it is most likely per quarter.  My wife and I are on the Dave Ramsey 7 step plan.  We're working on paying off debt, which we're doing well with.  But even if we paid off our debt before this, we'd be on a diet of rice and beans.  &amp;#x200B;I wanted to ask some others here, parents, who the hell do you do this?  Are there any tips or tricks that i could learn to make this more manageable?  How would you even consider this if you have a second or third child, let alone a kid in daycare.  My wife and I have a HHI of around $145/yr.  We have a monthly budget, and almost all our extra money goes toward paying down debt.  The reasons i'm asking is because i want to have a mental plan for this if my daughter would eventually want to do this.

ab0ip9	personalfinance	**Some context:** (Sorry if this doesn't belong in this sub.) In October I stopped working in NY and sort of coasted off of my savings until this December. My boyfriend who lives in WI had the option to terminate his lease early and took it so that we could move in together. Right now I'm going to be working here for ~9.50/h full time starting in January. The main problem right now is housing. &amp;nbsp;The places we've applied to so far seem to dislike us because I just moved and am not working yet or because my last pay stubs were from October and I guess that raises some red flags (I honestly thought me finding a job so quickly and having a decent credit score would be enough to show that I'm a competent tenant/not a liability but I guess I'm wrong.) &amp;nbsp;My boyfriend used his savings for his termination fee + other surprise expenses and I'm pretty much dry right now and coasting off of my credit card. I don't *think* this is too much of a problem right now because I can afford to take the hit to my credit and can pay it all off in January but that's only true if we find housing. So I need some advice/resources for finding housing.&amp;nbsp;**Some general info:**  * Both of us are 21  * My boyfriend's credit score is just above 650, mine is roughly 730 last I checked. * I have ~120 in my checking account, 120 in cash, ~1.2k available credit, and another ~0.5k available credit via Paypal Credit. My boyfriend doesn't have a credit card and as far as this post is concerned is basically dry.  * My boyfriend's last pay stub was from this month, mine was from October (or half way through this January since pay is biweekly.) * Our total monthly income would be somewhere around 2.1k before any reductions.  * Worst case scenario is he moves back in with his parents and I move over overseas to start fresh, but this would have a strong negative impact on his health and composure. We're both obviously trying to avoid this.&amp;nbsp;Right now it looks like either the both of us are going to be staying in a hotel until things get better or he'll move back with his parents and I'll stay in a hotel until can get things sorted out. I can (barely) afford to stay at a hotel alone while I work here (I'm going to have a electric burner to cook on and utilize the free breakfast to try and cut down on food costs) but this is obviously a short term solution and I can't seem to find a place that doesn't view me as a liability. Plus between the hotel/food expenses and my income those application/holding fees are going to start adding up *really* fast. Could you give me some advice?

ady61s	AmItheAsshole	I need some help, Reddit. I’ll try to be as unbiased as possible and present both sides as fairly as I can.Presently, I [M27] am the sole provider for my family’s finances. I work tech support from 7am-4pm on weekdays, and I’m on call with a second job every weekend (Sat 9am-4pm and Sun 9am-9pm). My wife [F28] is a stay-at-home mom for our daughter [7], and she regularly keeps the house tidy, does laundry, often makes dinner, etc. She also hasn’t needed a job since we got married, as my salary has always covered us well enough. We have a modest house, a single used-car payment, and have decent finances compared to other low/middle class families.But lately, our finances have been getting worse than we’d prefer. We have several thousands of dollars in credit card debt (all from necessities, gas, groceries, etc), and only enough savings to last us a month (with roughly the same amount in our checking account). Long story short, we’re spending slightly more than I’m making, and it’s causing some strain.We’ve already made some of the simpler lifestyle adjustments (no unnecessary spending, less fast food, etc), but we’re still hurting financially. My proposed solution to this problem is for my wife to find a part-time job in town to work while our daughter is at school. As an act of fairness, I’d step up and help with housework appropriately. It’s not a perfect situation, and we’d definitely need some adjustment, but adding a part-time salary would relieve our entire financial situation in a few short months, and we’d build savings after that with her added income.The problem with my proposal is that my wife doesn’t want a job.Her proposal instead is for me to find a better/higher paying job. That way, things can stay as they are, but I’d be making more money. Right now, I’ve had the same position at my company for three and a half years, and it’s a great company, but I’ve tried to “climb the ladder” many times over the years with no success. As a response to this, our financial situation, and my wife’s desire, I’ve been considering switching jobs lately. My wife is hoping for me to get a position in management to increase my salary (though I don’t have the skills for management just yet, so that’s not really an option).The issue with her proposal is that I’m already near the salary ceiling for my position/skills. We crunched the numbers, and if I switch companies/jobs, I won’t be making any more money (or much more) at all.  Another consideration is that I’m pretty established in my current company (I was employee 14 in what’s now a growing 75 person startup), and if I move to another company, I’d be starting from square one in terms of tenure/reputation/impact. My wife and I have been having discussions about this on and off for a few months now, and she’s applied for three positions in that time, but because she doesn’t actually want a job, our conversations about it have become unfortunately intense.I want her to get a part-time job to help with the finances, she wants me to get a different/better job to help the finances, and our conversations often devolve into fights where one of us eventually leaves the room. Her resistance to help with the finances is weighing down on me, my pressure for her to work is weighing down on her, and our fights are weighing down on us both. We’re exhausted talking about it, but she’s called me an asshole once or twice in fights about this, so I need to know, AITA for pressuring her to get a part-time job?

afypod	legaladvice	For a bit of background: My husband was a naval aviator and then a commercial airline pilot. Due to some health concerns (high risk pregnancy for me, our resulting newborn, and a heart condition on his end) he decided to start looking for a different career. As his background is in engineering, he found a phenomenal job in his field as a private contractor for the Federal Government.  This of course means all of the background checks, etc., to allow him clearance and access into the place is he’ll need to go to perform his job.This is where things get tricky. A couple of months ago, my husband stopped into thegrocery store to pick up some onions.  For some reason, our debit card wouldn’t go through. More than likely he just entered an incorrect pin, but regardless he texted me to make sure I had transferred money into that account. I stated I had, but by the time I replied he said he had already put the onions back and left the store.A couple of weeks later he received a call from the local police department. The store had reported him for shoplifting. The officer stated that they had my husband on camera. This was very baffling, as my husband said he clearly walked the bag of onions back to the produce section and replaced them. The officer replied that it wasn’t the onions, but when my husband walked from the checkout stand to the produce department he had something red in his hand, and when he left the store he no longer had that in his hand. Guys, our debit card is a bright red Wells Fargo card. My husband informed the officer of that, and asked what they thought of the red object was, exactly? The officer couldn’t answer that, but advised my husband and the store had looked in other areas of the store where he had shopped and it appeared that a box he had been looking at had also been opened so it must have been one of the things from the box. My husband asked what was inside this box that was red and the officer did not know. Regardless of the store not actually being able to say what they think my husband took, the officer issued him a citation and gave him an optional court date for the 28th of this month. As a result, my husband has had to leave his temporary-pending-clearance role at his job until he goes to court and the charge is either dismissed or he is found innocent.This was over a week ago now, and even after the court date it’s possible that it will take him several more weeks to get his clearance back. The salary for his position breaks down to nearly $60 an hour, and even under the best of circumstances he will be out a month’s wages at that rate.First of all, what is the best way for us to approach this shoplifting charge? Anyone who knows my husband knows it’s completely bogus, and frankly it doesn’t sound like the store has anything other than paranoia and some poor video driving their case.Second, is there any way to go after the store for lost wages? After our myriad of health issues all hitting at practically one time, our family really needed this money. It’s in credulous to me that a business could throw out such a flaky accusations and a literally cost a family thousands upon thousands of dollars to deal with it.**TLDR**:  my husband was accused of shoplifting by a local grocery store, after their security footage caught him carrying out his own debit card and they thought it was a product from inside the store. Due to the pending charge and court date, my husband cannot work at his position which requires he have a federal security clearance. First of all, how do we deal with this flimsy charge? And second, is there a way to go after the store for what will turn out to be over a month of lost wages?

It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.A few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.The one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.This was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.

I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.Was I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?

Everytime I think about this I have a nervous breakdown at the thought of my parents having sex. It feels like I have been betrayed, and it has ruined my relationship with them both. Please help.

He was upfront and told my mother we did it and so did I. Now my mother wants us to marry. And we only had oral sex, not even actual intercourse, but my family being heavily Christian. Think I should marry him. He’s only 17 still in his final year of high school about to graduate. I’m in my first year of college. I don’t have a car of my own nor do I have job yet. Obviously he’s still in school. So yeah. I guess what would y’all do in this situation? I’m honestly just disappointed in myself. I broke my mothers trust. I hurt my mother badly.

ajngfi	personalfinance	My dad is in his 60s and he currently has whole life insurance (100k policy) - with cash surrender of 40k. Annual premium of 1.5k, which he apparently doesn't pay cuz the interest earned from the policy is enough to pay it.That 40k seem alot to be sitting around in his whole life insurance. So I'm  thinking about improving his financial situation by -- cancelling his whole life insurance, and withdrawing the 40k- put the 40k in an index fund and not touch until retirement- buy a 20 year term life insurance w/ 100k policy (I got a quote for 93$ monthly/ 1110 annual)I calculated how much insurance our family needs and how long we need it for, and 20 years /100k is right for our situation. So does my idea sound good? It seems to be a Better option then his current option, but I'm a high school dropout so I feel dumb and stupid.

akn3i0	AmItheAsshole	My older sister is going through a messy divorce and she's pregnant. I am graduating college in April and my friends and I are planning to travel from May - August to Europe, East Asia and SEA. We've been making plans for months and discussed the itinerary many times. My sister wants me to cancel the vacation and come stay with her to help with her infant. She's giving birth in April. I told her that I don't want to miss out on this opportunity to travel. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I do not think I will get the chance to travel for an extended period of time with my friends ever again. Unless we're all retired 60 year olds. She called me selfish. But she had the chance to travel after university with her friends too. I think she's being unfair in trying to deny me this opportunity that she had.Both our parents are coming over to help her during the first few months. The father of the child is also committed to helping financially. She argued that both our parents are elderly and would not be of much help. But I don't feel like that's my problem to solve. I've been looking at some affordable domestic workers/hired help to do the household chores so that she can focus on the baby but she shot that suggestion down because she doesn't want to pay extra for outside help. She would rather make me miserable for free. I arranged the baby shower that she complained was too small. I know she's family. It's duty. I don't want my future nephew to suffer. Etc. But I do want to go on this full vacation.So AITA for choosing to go on a vacation instead of staying behind to help her with her infant?

ans8wm	legaladvice	"Right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. Here is the story.&amp;#x200B;Last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. While we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. My brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what I know it's one of his biggest hobbies. Well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal&amp;#x200B;Well, until yesterday. My brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and I needed to return it immediately. I honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. Well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a Boba Fett figure from his collection. He confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.&amp;#x200B;I was furious and took it from him. Here is the problem though, after I confirmed with my brother it was his I found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. Apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. So my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. Well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. I told him I would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. &amp;#x200B;Honestly, what are my options here? I can't afford to pay him back right now.

He was very sweet, and I liked spending time with him. He lived an hour and a half a way and would drive up all the time and stay at my house. My pet had a vet appointment near him (long story but no exotic vet in my area) and he came up for a day, we drove down the next, and drove back the day after so my pet could heal from surgery. My nana died the day we drove down and I wasn’t in the best mood. The day after this was my birthday. So at this point we had spent the last four days together. For my birthday we got lunch and went to dinner with my family. Then i wanted to go to a bar with my best friend. He got very upset that I didn’t want to spend my birthday with him (even though I did, and several days prior) and stormed out of my house. I angrily texted him at like 3am a little drunk that I was mad at him for making my birthday about him. He ignored me for four days until he called me last night and broke up with me (the day before Valentine’s day.) I understand that he drove a lot for me, and I thanked him a ton and offered gas money, but I feel like this is a weird thing to be dumped over?

at2j2l	personalfinance	I don't even know where to start... I am at a really low point in my life. Which is saying a lot!! Well to start maybe a little background. I am a recovering Heroin addict and I have been sober for over two years. I know I will probably get a lot of negative responses from just that alone but it's fine. So in the past two years I had completely rebuilt my life. I went to a sober living home for 8 months, during that time I saved, bought a car, and got my own place. It was extremely hard learning how to do all of that for what was basically the first time in my life but I managed really well. I had a nice little set up for myself that I was very proud of. Well in the past two months my life has been completely turned upside down. It started with the transmission going out in my car. Being that I worked a minimum wage job I certainly had no savings to get it fixed. So it got repossesed. After that things went down hill a lot faster. I was relying on friends I had made through work to help me when they could for rides to work and I would walk to the store if needed. My former employer knew my situation so when rides fell through they were pretty understanding but eventually they had to let me go. Which I am not mad at them at all and I understand completely. Needless to say I was evicted shortly after that. Luckily my mother has let me sleep on her couch for right now. She works two jobs to provide for herself and my younger siblings and barely gets by as it is so she really doesn't need the extra stress of me being here. She definitely can not help with transportation to a job. My other family hasn't quite forgiven me for the wreckage of my past (and I don't blame them) so I have no outside help at all. I feel very stuck right now and I have no idea how to get out of this hole I am in. I had help the first time around from the sober living program I was in. I had thought about that as well and it is a place for people fresh in recovery so that is not an option. I know all of this is of my own making and I should have had my life together a long time ago.I just need all of the advice I can get right now. Where can I start? Are there places willing to help that I am unaware of? I really don't know at this point. I just know that I need to get off of my mothers couch and get it together.

auqnv1	Advice	"  This is a true story. Details have been changed to protect all parties involvedA colleague of mine recently submitted a request to work from home once a week. The circumstances are as follows: A few months ago, her one-year old son was diagnosed with a rare, terminal disease. After months in the hospital, her once perfectly healthy baby now has a breathing tube and feeding tube. He has multiple seizures daily or per week and calling 911 or racing to the hospital has become a norm. Home health aides, nurses and hospice care are in and out of their home daily. Her son will most likely not survive to the age of two.She and her husband have been on FMLA (unpaid leave – protects employment) since the first hospital stint… they did work on and off, in the office, from the hospital and from home.  Currently, she has returned to work in the office full-time. She lives 60 miles from the institution. Her department works on laptops. They do not leave their desks – no forward-facing work.The institution’s HR policy states an employee can work from home if *approved by their direct report/management.* In several departments, throughout the institution, working from home is common under special circumstances (Example: When a mother returns from maternity leave, a department manager may approve she can work from home one day a week, to assist with caring for her newborn baby.)The employee submitted a request in October of 2018 to work from home. She received her answer in February of 2019 (after several inquiries regarding the request’s status). She was not denied permission; however, it was clear her management team was not pleased with the request. She was told she can work from home every third Friday. If it snows, and the roads are bad, she must drive in or choose to stay home and take a personal day. (Please note: During inclement weather, nurses and home health aides commonly call-out, as they too have their own families.)Her management team stated, *“If we allow you to consistently work from home, other staff members may expect the same privilege.”*Then, my colleague contacted HR – hoping something else could done. HR’s response, *“If management is consistent with all employees, there is nothing we can do.""*My colleague is heartbroken, stressed, and feels defeated.I am posting this for two reasons:1. Is there any advice someone can offer for my colleague? She can’t quit, as her family needs health insurance (the medical bills are already astronomical) and finding a new job would be difficult under these circumstances.2. Perhaps, I’m bias or just a rational person with empathy or both! … but I need to understand *WHY?* Why did the management team keep the request for over four months, and then, basically deny it? Why would a leadership team show little to no empathy for their employees? What do they gain? And how does HR not see a breach of protocol and policy? Clearly, these are extenuating circumstances - the woman’s child is dying - and yet, working from home once a week is seen as a “privilege” by her management team? It’s revolting, and as an employee of the same institution, I am both horrified and embarrassed by their actions.

b2wgt0	AmItheAsshole	A few notes; I have a full sized truck, live in an apartment building, and have an infant still in a huge reverse car seat. Getting the kiddo in and out of the truck requires the door to be pretty far open and I'm terrified of hitting another car with the door so I park as close to the opposite line as I can without being on it. This leaves my passenger side with a crap ton of room and allows me not to worry. This doesn't leave much room for me to get out or the person next to me to get in so I always try to park in the last spot but it's not always available. I pull in my mirrors when next to another large vehicle to try and help with the spacing but am I still the asshole for knowingly giving the other person less room to get in and out if I'm still technically in my spot?

b4n1hq	AmItheAsshole	"No, I am not an anti vaxxer. I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.I discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his ""anti vaxxer sister"" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. I asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him.

My father never seemed like he would ever leave us out. Now my mother is dying of the same thing and keeping me in the dark. She won't tell me anything regarding her diagnosis, I had to learn from other family members who live out of state. Rumor is she is in her will she is giving everything to a non profit.  I'm afraid it maybe too late to challenge my fathers will and how to get evidence that might prove me right. She has made statements that I denied her the ability to practice her religion by refusing her the ""right"" to have my child baptized, she also has blamed my wife and I for making rules that she couldn't follow which led to us denying her visitation to her granddaughter.

bepaue	AmItheAsshole	"My husband and I have a 5 year old boy (R) who is named after my father, who died when I was 14. His middle name (C) is after my MIL's father, and he has my husband's (therefore FIL's) surname. My FIL is known exclusively by his middle name, as was his uncle who raised him, but my husband has always been called by his first name.  When my son was a baby my FIL started calling him by his middle name. I asked him to stop, and told him how important the name was to me. FIL then said that he would always be known as C to him. I told him, mostly jokingly, that if he kept calling R that, then I would change his surname to my maiden name. Everyone laughed. Since then however, both MIL and FIL refer to him as C, but not around me, only around my husband. R doesn't like it, and has told them C is not his name.  My husband has asked them to stop, but there is a pretty strained relationship there so he's reluctant to rock the boat. In Christmas and Birthday cards they only ever write ""To our grandson.""Today the in-laws had come round for a visit, and just as they were getting up to leave FIL called my son C in front of me. I said ""who?"" very loudly, but FIL just walked off to the car. MIL had missed it, but could see I was upset and asked what was wrong. I told her and said that I thought it was incredibly disrespectful. I did swear a few times, but then apologised and explained it was just because I was so angry. She was not impressed, she told me that I was being ridiculous and that it wasn't important. I that it was to me, and that if it wasn't important to them, then they should call him by his given name.  FIL had then come back to see what was happening, and MIL was laughing when she told him that he'd upset me. He also laughed and said ""story of my life"" before going back to the car. My husband understands how angry I am, but doesn't think the fight is worth it. He's right in that we can't change them, but my current attitude is that if they can't call him R then they don't see him.

bg0cw3	AmItheAsshole	Just as a preface I work as a cashier for a pretty big grocery store, the job sucks most days because some managers are incompetent and like to either micro manage or do absolutely nothing. The job pays less than minimum wage because we have less than 25 employees but everyone still gets about 27 hours a week because people with seniority get the hours (which is fine). This September will be my second year working there.Now there is a system in place to request days off. Basically you just have to do it at least 2 weeks before the schedule is set but you can do it as far back as 5 months. I had a trip coming up in July that was very important to me. So last November I told every manager I could including the director at the time that I would like to request those days in July off as my vacation I get every year. All of them said it was fine. So I reminded them in December and January that I wanted them again. In February as soon as I could I requested my vacation week in July and reminded them again. I have reminded them at least once a month since. We even got a new director and he said it was fine. Now last week I was talking to a coworker and brought up that I requested these day and he say oh really I was actually planning some thing that week too, I asked him if he requested the days and he said no not yet I'll just wait till the end but they'll give them to me because I have seniority, he then told me that another co worker was going to request that week as well and that she also had seniority. Both these people only have maybe 1 to 3 years on me but seniority is taken very seriously at this job. I later asked the co manager( who makes the schedule) If I could still get those days off and she said she didn't know she would have to see because other people requested it that day. Usually taling a week off isn't a big deal but the problem is that 3 people want to so they may only let 1 maybe 2 go. So I thought if I don't get these vacation days then that's it I'm perfectly ok with losing this job. I drive for uber, postmates, Lyft, doordash, and uber eats, on my time off so I could do that until I find another job or just continue going to school.  So my question is, WIBTA if I just don't show up to work if they schedule me on the days I requested?

bg0yvp	AmItheAsshole	Hello,&amp;#x200B;I wanted to ask: AITA for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?&amp;#x200B;Last month I took part in a retreat. The location's internet didn't work, so we all just had our mobile data. There was a deaf participant from Russia, and he couldn't access the mobile network with his phone. So he asked me if I could give him access through hotspot so he can communicate with his family.I have limited mobile data, I get 500mb per month and from there on, I pay 5 bucks for each 100mb (it's pretty expensive here). I only use mobile data for WhatsApp and maybe sometimes to check my schedule. So I agreed to give him hotspot under the condition that he only uses it for WhatsApp. No videos, no excessive photo transmissions because it's limited. He agreed.&amp;#x200B;But when I got lasts month bill I was kinda shocked: he apparently used over 6GB additionally. I was able to track it down to him because this huge amount of data was consumed during these two retreat days. But before confronting him via Facebook, I asked a friend who was his roommate, if he noticed anything. He told me that this Russian guy did sign language videochat the whole night through with his parents. I asked my friend if he had the impression that it were an emergency, but he said that their chat seemed very lighthearted and included lots of laughing.&amp;#x200B;So I don't know what to do. The bill is over 60 bucks, my budget doesn't really allow it. And I told the deaf guy in advance to only use WhatsApp, but I didn't get a warning that he was using so much data, so he maybe didn't even realize it. In addition, my friend told me that I should give him the benefit of being disabled where videochatting is often the easiest way of communication...

bi10jn	Advice	Hi all. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Some background: I (17F) have been babysitting since I was 12, and have been babysitting for this particular family, which consists of 3 kids (currently ages 3, 6, and 9) since I was 14. I adore the kids and the family. I babysit for them often, even staying over night a few times.Where I live, according to care.com, the rate is about $14.50/hour for all the things I do as a sitter (keep the kids ofc, clean, drive kids around, homework help, cook, give baths, etc.), and i always charge &amp;10/hour, which I think is fair. On to the situation. The mom reached out to me asking if I could keep their youngest all day when they take their oldest to the beach to celebrate her birthday. She asked me to come at 7:30 AM and estimated they would be home around 9:30 PM. So, 14 hours. I agreed. So the day comes (yesterday), and I show up at 7:30 and it turns out I’m keeping both of the youngest kids. Okay, no problem. Wish I knew before hand, but, no problem. The mom told me he would be with the neighbors a lot throughout the day (his best friend lives there). The middle child was also already awake when I got there.Throughout the day, I spent about $17-ish dollars of my own money on them, as they didn’t leave any spending money (despite that all their suggestions of what we do with the day included going out and spending money). I honestly didn’t mind though because I figured I would get paid adequately. I made sure the kids had a blast, we went to the park, got donuts, went to the play place at chick fil a, played outside for hours, etc.. The only times that the middle child spent any time with the neighbors, it was in the front yard and I was monitoring (unlike the mom said). I think it’s also important to note that the 3 year old is kind of going through a “terrible 3’s phase”, and she has been very difficult and defiant lately, which makes things quite difficult. The parents know and acknowledge this). After giving them a bath (not to mention we used a bath bomb I bought them) the kids finally went to bed at 8:30. I cleaned the house till 9:00, and they got home around 9:30. They were very appreciative like always. The mother wrote the check, folded it in half and gave it to me (she normally did this). I left, and when I got in my car I noticed I only got $100. That’s $40 less than what I expected for working for 14 hours. This has happened before with this family. There have even a couple of instances where they would underpay me like $10-$15, but I always let it go because although they aren’t poor, they defiantly aren’t rich. Another very important factor is that the mother is my moms co worker, which is how I met the family in the first place. They both work at a preschool, and they are good acquaintances. I don’t want to just never babysit for them again, because they are where I get most of my money because they ask me to babysit so often. It would be a huge toll if I stopped. I also have to be delicate because I wouldn’t want to make things awkward for my mom at work. I want to address this, perhaps over a text message because this is our main form of communication all the time. What the hell should I say???

bi3tz2	AmItheAsshole	My husband values material things highly, and gets upset if something he owns gets damaged in any way. And I’m not talking large, expensive items. If the spine of a paperback book is opened all the way and cracked, it’s ruined. He once returned and reordered a DVD from Amazon 4 times because there were minor cracks on the case. This past Christmas, my parents gifted us a new Apple TV. The remote is glass. We have two boys, a very rambunctious almost 3 year old and a 1 year old. In January, the 3 year old picked the remote up off the couch and dropped it, causing it to crack. I was immediately worried because my husband had been having a terrible week. Let me preface the next few sentences by saying that my husband has never been physically abusive in any way toward me or our children. My husband’s fuse is short. He is angered easily, and he is not a calm angry person. He screams and shouts and says cruel things. Every little thing the 3 year old did that week was setting him off, and I was starting to see the 3 year old being afraid of him. So I told my husband the baby did it. The baby was in a phase of grabbing and throwing anything he could get his hands on, so it was totally plausible. I had assumed that my husband would realize that a tiny defenseless baby would not have done it out of malice, and that he would be much easier on the baby than on the 3 year old. I was wrong. I should have just told him I accidentally dropped it. He would have been furious with me, but that would have been the end of it. From that day on, my husband has shown an obvious and strong favoritism toward our 3 year old. He’s even said on occasion things like, “3 year old is my favorite.” And, “I don’t like baby.” It has honestly broken my heart. The baby feels everything bigger than his brother, and babies are perceptive. Even my mom has commented that she thinks the baby can sense that his father dislikes him. Now to the event I am asking about. Last night, I was cooking dinner, and my husband was supposed to be getting the baby down to sleep. He was getting a cup of milk ready for baby when I noticed baby was crawling around with the Apple TV remote in his hand. I mentioned it to my husband so he could go grab the remote from baby. My husband responded with something along the lines of, “What does it matter? He’s already ruined it.” I responded with, “funny story. It’s actually 3 year old who broke it.” My husband lost it. He called me a liar and said that he couldn’t trust me. He blamed me for his dislike of baby, saying, “you’ll have to live with the fact that YOU are the reason I don’t like baby!” He then told me that I owed him an apology for lying. I absolutely refused. I told him that I would not apologize for trying to protect my child (the 3 year old). Now he won’t even talk to me or be in the same room with me.

bivkpa	legaladvice	so since last week I noticed my trash has been being taken from our neighbors but I didn't think much of it until I noticed it was filled with cement. I let it slide up until this week today to see if it was a one time thing. Next thing you know when I left to school the dude grabbed it, took my trash out, and filled it with cement yet again and my trash bin keeps breaking more than it already is. I'm going to speak with him later today in hopes he stops but I seriously doubt it won't. Many neighbors around here don't respect other peoples property. What can I do if he doesn't stop? I don't want to have to pay for another trash bin if it breaks or pay a bill from the trash company if it comes to that.

bj3yub	legaladvice	Basically, due to personal reasons I was unable to cash checks for a while and my employer would not offer direct deposit so i had some checks pile up for a while and forgot about them. There are about 20 checks that total to around $7,500. Back in January, I contacted the payroll company and the secretary took my info down and said she would follow up and get somebody to deal with my situation. I have called the payroll company about 6 times in the past 3 weeks now. The same secretary answers every time and has told me that the person I need to talk to is in meetings every time I call and she will pass on my information to have her get back with me. When I called yesterday, i was told by the same secretary that the woman she has been passing my info onto has just gotten back from vacation and she has passed on my info already and will follow up with it again. I have no idea what to do now or if i should be talking to a lawyer. I have the checks and pay stubs in my possession which from my perspective are signed receipts of debt from the payroll company.

bkdol0	personalfinance	Hello everyone, as the title suggests I will be graduating college with over 120k in student loan debt. My parents and I made the decision to go to this school because it offers very good placement into Econ/finance which is what O have been aiming to study. Due to our family income level we are considered the lowest end of upper-middle class so we paid full tuition over the four years. My parents were able to contribute a total of 100k over four years and took out 80k in loans. I am responsible for the remaining 120k. I’m graduating with a double degree in Econ and CS and I will be starting as an entry level consultant at a medium sized consulting firm in the Boston area. I don’t think I would have been able to get this job without the opportunities I got at my college. Of course, on the other hand, I’m saddled with so much debt. My expected starting salary is around 75k and I’m struggling to even ask myself how I’ll pay it off. Does anyone have any advice for me?

bl7d35	AmItheAsshole	I always knew my daughter really liked to draw but she always liked to draw mythical creatures like dragons. I never expected anything vulgar from her until today when she was rushing out the door for school I noticed she dropped her sketchbook so I went to bring it to her and to my surprise- there was multiple pages of nude drawings of men AND a women. I was appalled. Don’t get me wrong I understand the concept of this for artists and that it’s normal for artists but my daughter is only 14. She has absolutely no business with these types of drawings. She was out the door before I could say anything. Obviously they cannot allow nude models in school so the only other explanation is that she has been viewing the images on 18+ websites. I did what I had to and went on her laptop (which her father and I paid for, btw) to see the history and as suspected a website full of adult nude models and even google searches for specific poses. I waited until my daughter got home and confronted her, i tried to be calm as I could and explained that she has no business viewing 18+ images and those models can get in big trouble if the police find out and underaged girl is viewing them. I told her I would then be confiscating her sketchbook and laptop until she agrees to draw something more age appropriate. i think that this is fair as she can have her stuff back immediately once she agrees, but she is mad and refusing to give in. If she need to practice drawing humans she can draw them from her head not from an adult websites. AITA?

bqflu9	AmItheAsshole	Married 5 years, no children. So I have some baggage, first and foremost. I was the oldest of 5 and my mom was an abusive alcoholic. Dad not in the picture. I was forced to raise my younger sibs as a result and hated it. I really had no childhood and went back to college in my late 20s because I never had the chance to focus on myself. As a result I really cannot stand children until the age of 14. I can’t stand their shrieks, their erratic movements, their whining, their sticky hands, their drool. I can go on. My husband and I are both childless and we’re happy that way. Two years ago my husbands brother and sisters started popping out children nearly at the same time. He now has a niece and nephew both under 2 year old. They live about 30-40 minutes away. My husband wants his sister and her baby to come over during the day (he works from home) so they can have lunch or walks together. He needs to stay at ours in order to work, but they like the idea of spending an hour together in the middle of the day while my SIL plays with her baby for 2-3 hrs. I really don’t feel comfortable with this and have told him so. There’s something deeply uncomfortable with having young children in my living space, even when I’m not there. I would hate coming home to the smell of diapers or baby food or spit up. We’re fighting because my husband thinks I’m being unreasonable to ban all children from our home even when I’m not there.

My mom allows him to stay at home with us for two reasons (from what she’s told me) 1) she’s afraid of him 2) she’s sorry for him. They are both incredibly toxic and it’s to the point where the court or ACS, I’m not sure which, has assigned my siblings therapists but we are coached by my mom on what to say and can only answer yes or no questions. I really don’t want my dad home with us and it hurts that he always avoids these consequences, but the problem is I don’t know how to go about it or what could actually happen.A few of my questions are1) If I tell someone who should I tell? My therapist, our lawyer, or the ACS worker? I am worried about confidentiality in the sense that they will tell my parents I told and I will face backlash of my parents.2) What could happen to my mom if I tell? She is our sole provider and I don’t want her to get into trouble because of her fears.3)What could happen to my siblings if I tell? My mom has instilled the horrors of foster care and group homes into our heads.

In 2015, a young family moved in. In 2016, we had a survey done in order to build a fence. The surveyors found that a 3x 3 foot area of neighbors driveway is on our property.Consulted a local real estate attorney recommended to us by the attorney who handled our wills. He recommended that we kindly approach new neighbors, discuss the situation, and ask them to sign a “permission of use” letter stating they have our permission to use the part of their driveway that is on our property.They refused! Mumbled something about a family member recommending they not sign it.Went back to our attorney who said “huh that is very strange. Nothing you can do now but take them to court, which could lead to hard feelings”.My main (only) concern is that we don’t want any trouble if we try to sell in a few years.

( My neighbor recently got over their asking in the same range.)I knew this house wouldn't be my 'forever' home. It would serve as a starter home. However I've been tossing up the idea of moving outside of town, and purchasing a rural property with acreage.The properties im looking into are in the 600,000 to 800,000 range. With 15-50 acres. I'm looking in, and out of the county. A lot of the properties I'm looking at are not in a very hot market. However I could see a few of them become quite desirable in the next 20 years. As cities expand. Basically the only way I'm going to be able to afford this is (not my idea actually). Is my parents are wanting to move in with my wife, and kids on this rural property. That being said I've been looking for properties with a good split, so we would have our own areas of the home to make it work.If I do sell my home.Between myself, and my parents we would be putting a hefty down payment on the home (20 to 30 percent).

c17hpk	AmItheAsshole	  My boyfriend Cam and I have been dating since early this year. It’s been great for the most part, but for the past couple of months we’ve been having arguments about his friend Lauren. Lauren and I don’t really get along. She’s like a sister to Cam so I tried to befriend her when we started dating, but she was always aloof to me. She’s very friendly with other people, but whenever I tried to talk to her, she would just answer with a few words then talk to someone else or leave. She would also make me feel out of place whenever we hung out with Cam’s other friends by bringing up things from their college days so everyone would be talking or laughing about something that I don’t know. I told Cam how I felt but he said that I must be misreading the situation because Lauren is not that kind of person. He said that I should give it more time, that maybe Lauren doesn’t know me that well yet that’s why she doesn’t talk to me a lot. But I know that she has befriended people who were introduced to her after I was, like Arlo, Cam’s friend from his new job which he started in March. The three of them play online games for hours while she hasn’t spent 3 minutes talking to me. More than once I asked Cam to talk to Lauren about why she doesn’t like me, but he refused. He said that unless Lauren was ignoring me or talking shit about me, she technically isn’t doing anything wrong by not being besties with me, and it would just make things awkward between the three of us. One time I told him that would talk to Lauren myself, and he said that I was making a mountain out of a molehill.Last Friday was Cam’s birthday so I threw a small dinner party at his favorite restaurant for him and invited our friends, excluding Lauren. I figured that I’m the one throwing the party so I should be able to invite who I want to, and I don’t want to invite and pay for someone who has shown time and time again that she doesn’t like my company and is not interested in being friends with me. Cam was really happy about the surprise at first, but when he learned that Lauren wasn’t going to be there, he pulled me aside and said I was an asshole for leaving Lauren out. He said I should’ve thought about how Lauren would feel if she learns that I invited everyone except her. I was shocked that he would say that when he knew how Lauren has treated me, so I told him that I just gave Lauren a taste of her own medicine and maybe now she’ll know how I feel when she leaves me out of conversations. Cam got really angry and said that he can’t be with someone who would treat Lauren like that. He stormed out of the restaurant and we’ve only talked once after that. I texted him yesterday to apologize and he said we should meet in person today to talk about this. I don’t even know what I should say to him.Am I the asshole?

c1gr3n	AmItheAsshole	I was in the TSA Precheck line where people are generally cognizant of the regulations. Unfortunately, a woman with her 3 children somehow ended up in this line. I have no patience for people who hold up the TSA screening line. This woman had to fish out all her feeding bottles from her 3 or 4 poorly organized bags and empty them before putting her belongings through security screening. As a result, she held up the security line for a long time. I finally had it and told her she should have been aware of the rules about liquids before getting in line and should have prepared for security screening before getting in line. I suggested that she step aside and let other travelers through and my suggestion was met with a few cheers. She seemed really embarrassed but didn’t apologize at all. After I passed the screen I mentioned to the TSA agent he should manage the queue better. When a traveler was holding up the line he needed to step in, and he failed. He apologized and I moved on. I don’t think I’m the ass but my co-worker mentioned I could have shown some compassion for the woman who was clearly struggling and clueless.

c1wmya	AmItheAsshole	Sorry, English isn’t my first language.I’m gay, my boyfriend is bisexual.I’m admittedly insecure and occasionally have jealousy issues. My boyfriend is insanely attractive and, while I’m not “ugly” by any standards, I’m nothing compared to him.It bothers me that he can virtually have anyone of either gender. I’m afraid that he will leave me for someone else.It’s always bothered me that he is also attracted to girls. I don’t really get it. Why is he attracted to other people (of the other gender) when he is dating me (who is a guy) ?I’ve never really gotten the whole “bisexual” thing. Maybe I’m shallow.We were watching a movie with another friend (his friend, who is a lesbian) when his friend made a remark (to him). She pointed out that one of the girls in the movie was “hot”. My boyfriend kinda shrugged and said that “she’s cute”.I don’t know why, but that really bothered me. I didnt want to make a scene, so I waited until his friend left. We had already talked about him and his attraction to women. I’m not saying that he can’t be attracted to women, just that I personally don’t “get” it, and I don’t want to know about it either.He apologized, said he forgot and that he was just responding to his friend. That’s understandable, but then he said that he “can’t just stop his attraction for women”. Which started a whole argument. I told him that he shouldn’t be attracted to other people when he’s in a relationship, he said otherwise.He said that its okay to find other people attractive, just as long as you don’t act on it. I said that he only thought that because he was bisexual, and that all bisexual people think like that. He said that it wasn’t true, and I told him that he should just pick a side at this point. He is a guy, dating a guy, so he should just he gay. There’s no need to be attracted to women unless he has the intent to cheat on me.I guess that made him upset, because he told me that he wasn’t going to talk about this with me and he left. I really couldn’t tell if he was mad or not but he just left. His sister called me a few hours ago and told me that I was being a jerk. This isn’t the first time this has happened. She said she doesn’t even know why my boyfriend is still with me, implying that I’m *always* a jerk.I don’t think I said anything wrong.

c2cmv9	AmItheAsshole	To start this off, I love my sister. I support her 100%. When she told me she is trans I got behind it immediately. I referred to her with the correct pronouns privately and used her chosen name for a full year before she came out. I fought for her when members of our family rejected her and I would and have immediately cut anyone off if they are in any way hateful towards her. When she came out she was embraced by many but rejected were loudly by enough people for it to be absolutely devastating. As a result we became very close and spend much more time together than we did before. Now, for the shitty part. Ever since she came out she’s been getting progressively more annoying. She FAKES stupidity, like will actually put on a 2000’s style Paris Hilton ditzy act. She’s taken up cattiness that she never ever had in her before and just recently I caught her pretending not to know how to put windshield wiper fluid in her car. Like, she actually created this whole scene where she was confused and needed help doing a task I know she can do because she taught me to do it when I got my license!A cousin eventually said something to her which resulted in a lot of tears and her calling that cousin transphobic (i know he’s not but he did come on really strong telling her that she was being fucking annoying) so I know that I have to tread very carefully.Now I’m wondering if this is just kind of like her going through the same self discovery I went through as a teenager and it will pass?

c7atcl	AmItheAsshole	"I should explain: there's no LGBT marriage or adoption/surrogacy in my country. The family bonds are quite strong and there's an expectation you'll get married and have children by the time you've reached mid-late 20s.When I was in university, I dated a man for a longer period. It was a secret relationship, like most gay relationships are. He left me after two years because he wanted to ""stop wasting time and focus on starting a family"", or something along those lines. That break-up mentally devastated me, but at the same time, I think it made me contemplate my reality and options.I rarely get sexually attracted to women. Still, I can have strong intimate feelings for female friends, and I've kissed women before and genuinely liked it, although not as much as kissing other men. But I have a strong desire to be a father, to care for my kids, and I think I'd do a good job at that. I also have a stable and secure job in naval engineering and I could provide for my family.There's a female friend whom I've known since childhood. Since returning to my hometown, we've been spending a lot of time together. She's a wonderful person and we share many similar interests regarding the future, family, values in life etc. My parents like her, though I'm sure they're also worried for me because I'm turning 27 and I'm still single. But the social pressure aside, if I ended up marrying someone like her, I think we'd make for great parents. She's traditional (in the no sex before marriage kind of way) and wants to be a mother more than anything. I relate to that strong will to be a parent.Given the circumstances, WIBTA or unfair if I did this?

I care for both of them since they are close friends but getting baby this early would make their life so much more difficult as they both go to high school. Where I live, the age of consent is 16 so my female friend might get into some deep problems but I'm not quite sure on that. It also is a taboo where I live to get pregnant at such a young age. Even if they'd decide to keep it, I'd still stay friends with them and be there for them if they'd ever need anything but I don't want them to start this part of their life so soon.What can/should I do? Since she has tested positive, I'd have to convince her to get it aborted which would be really difficult to do even for a friend and maybe even be insulting.

c8bw67	AmItheAsshole	"I work in an office building with a rather well-paying job that took several years of education to get (pay is in the low 6-figures). It's a great job that makes me feel like I'm doing more than just paperwork. Bottom-line is, I really love this job and probably won't be able to find anything else like it.I'm eating lunch with some co-workers, and this girl from a neighboring department joins us. After a while, when other people are breaking up into their own little conversation bubbles, she turns to me and says she likes how I look. I say 'Thanks' and then go back to eating. She touches my shoulder and says ""You alright?"" I nod 'Yeah' and go back to eating and listening to other people talk.On another day, she says, 'Wow you keep in shape. You must work out' (which I do). I say 'Thanks' and go back to lunch. She gets closer and says, 'So how do you do it?' I just keep giving short, direct answers. Point is, I don't have any interest in dating co-workers. There's a saying **Don't shit where you eat**. I've heard of people getting fired when workplace relationships turn sour and things get awkward or hostile. I love this job, and I don't wanna do anything to compromise it.Third time this happens (on another day), she asks me when I get off work (schedule is publicly posted so she could find out if she really wanted to). I say 'Probably when I feel like shooting myself'. That was a baaaaaad joke but she laughed anyways and said I was funny. Then she put her hand on my knee. I gave out this awkward laugh and shifted away. She asked me if everything was alright and I looked at her and said 'Maybe you shouldn't do that again' We just stared at each other for a while before she got up and left.Later I heard she was telling people I couldn't take a compliment and that I made her feel 'uncomfortable'. Some of my co-workers didn't believe it, mostly because they were there, but the others weren't so they just believed what they heard first. I went to her to talk about it but she said I made it clear that I didn't want anything to do with her and to leave her alone otherwise I was 'harassing' her.The moment she said that word, that set off red alarms in my head, and I headed to HR. I gave them my side of the story, and I heard later on that they interviewed co-workers that I said was there at each incident. Afterwards, they said the investigation was closed and that no further action will be taken but they will keep a record of this for future incidents.When the girl heard about this, she was *pissed*. She said I was trying to destroy her career, that I was taking advantage of her (she never explained how), and how hard she worked to get here. She started breaking down and crying, everyone was looking at me. I just sat there, eyes wide, until she and another co-worker left the room together.

c8o0w8	legaladvice	This morning, I went to meet a client that that I’ve been talking to for a few days. The son was 8 years old. He was very quiet and was messily eating his breakfast. He didn’t speak a word to me and I thought he was very shy. The mom just told me that I would have to look after the house and feed him. And she told me the hours I had to work and I gave an hourly rate. She was doing a tour of everything and showed me his room. When I was in there I noticed a box of diapers in the corner, one diaper on the dresser and a box of wipes. I got a little concerned and asked her about it. I thought she would just say the diaper is only because of nightly bed wetting. Turns out her son has autism, he is not really verbal and not potty trained. I told her that I charge more when I have to give that much care. She got angry and said she was going to report me to the website. And that it’s illegal and discriminatory to charge her more for her sons disability. My usual rate is cheaper than most. I only do older children that I basically just have to be in the room with. I do homework and study for classes for majority of the time. I’ve only had like 4-5 special needs clients and they required more care so I charge more. The other parents were upfront about the child’s needs and what my duties were (diapers, hitting, spitting, bitting, cleanups, constant monitoring)  She never mentioned her son being special needs since we’ve been talking that’s why I told her the cheaper price.She also threatened to report me to the board of nursing, even though I didn’t get hired as a CNA. I recently got my CNA, the only reason she even knows about it is because this morning as we were chatting over coffee, she had asked me about my life/college/nursing major.

caiqdh	AmItheAsshole	My wife has a younger brother (29) who has been in a relationship with his high school sweetheart (who's also a 29 year old male) for about 12 years. I think of both of them as my family, they're my children's uncles, we spend a bunch of time together and we get along great. I recently had a vasectomy, I'm 44, we have 3 kids and we aren't planning on having any more. After one Sunday lunch with our BILs, we sent the kids away and us adults had some drinks and started talking about my vasectomy. At one point, I said how great it was to finally not have to worry about protection, and how great it felt without it. And I said I almost feel sorry for them not experiencing it. My BIL laughed and said: What are you talking about, we haven't used protection since high school.I was going to reply something, but the kids came running in so I dropped the topic. I later thought about what he said and talked to my wife about it, saying that I don't think it's safe for them to be having sex without condoms, as a couple of gay men, and my wife laughed at me. Apparently, just because they've been together for a long time, it's safe? She told me to drop it and let them live their lives however they want.I thought it was ridiculous of her to have that reaction to her own brother not using protection and realized she wasn't going to tell them anything about it. So I figured I would buy some condoms and give them to my BILs and tell them I was worried about their safety and that they should really rethink not using protection.A couple of days ago, we had another lunch together, we sent the kids away again, and I gave them the condoms. I rehearsed a whole speech about how I wouldn't want anything to happen to them and that they should stay safe. But, rather than seeing my gesture for what it was - a gesture of care - they were offended. They asked if I am suggesting they shouldn't trust each other? They said they had never slept with anyone else their whole lives and if they managed to have an exciting enough sex life not to cheat on each other for 12 years, they'll probably manage the same in the future. And my wife's brother also said that, by the same token, I should be continuing to wear condoms despite having had a vasectomy. After shouting at me for 10 minutes, they just left. My wife has been incredibly mad with me and demanded I apologize to them, but I refuse to apologize for caring about their health and safety. I don't see how what I did was THIS horrible. They could have just declined the condoms. And their arguments are ridiculous. So what if they've been together for 12 years? People have cheated on each other after being together for longer than that.	EXPERT	How do you not see that?	<EXPERT_PCT_0_AUTHOR>	What is wrong with you?	<EXPERT_PCT_1_AUTHOR>	author_token_model

She’s incredibly upset with me and our group of friends think I’m being cruel. Here’s the backstory, she’s been dating her boyfriend for 10+ years. They have 2 kids together. He cheats on her every few months. I can list at least 15 different women/incidents that he has cheated with in just the 4 years I’ve known her. That’s not an exaggeration and those are only the times she has definitive proof of. She won’t leave , she’s never going to leave. I try to be understanding but I’ve also told her I don’t understand why she stays, her response is always a different variation of “Men will be men” and that she loves him. I’ve always been there for her, usually she catches him late at night. Going through his phone while he sleeps. She’ll call me hysterically crying, I’ve always dropped what I’m doing and either talk to her on the phone for hours or go get her and talk in person. This drama typically goes on for 1-2 weeks of me basically being her on-call therapist. I feel as if I put in more effort to help her recover emotionally than he does.I’ve offered every bit of advice and resource I can possibly think of. At this point I’m exhausted. She is a sweet person and a good friend to me and I understand the hurt of being cheated on and I know leaving isn’t easy but I honestly just don’t want to hear about it anymore.

I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.​Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.​Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""Me: ""It's John.""​Ted: ""What?""​Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.""​This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""​His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""​Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.​Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""​(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)​As promised, I ignored him.​7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.​I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.​Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""​I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""​A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.​*AM* I the a-hole on this?"

We have managed to work it out until now, but I feel like something is absent. She will always talk about future plans, like moving in together and marriage. And in response I would just agree and go along with it. I never really had those feeling back though. I just pretended and it slowly just transformed into a reality. I am not sure if I want the things she wants, or if I don’t want them with her. Another part of our relationship is that she does not really have anyone she is close with besides me. Her family is tough, and she spends most of her time with me. I am afraid if I leave her she will literally have no one.

cd9tqr	Advice	"I originally posted this on AITA wondering if it would be wrong to flat out cut her from my life, but there were a few replies on other ways to go about our friendship so I figured I would ask you guys for your opinions.I was at my tennis club waiting for my  mate to get there one day so we could practice a bit, when he texted me  and said he couldn't make it. No big deal, there is normally someone  there I can have a hit with or at least sit and watch for a bit. No such  luck, the only person there was a 12 year old girl all by herself. This is weird because we don't have any junior teams but I figured why no  ask her for a hit. We got a talking a bit and I found out that she's  newish to our city and her parents just dropped her off there and left,  and she was just going to walk home whenever she wanted. This struck me  as unusual, but I did similar things at that age so it didn't ring too many alarm bells tbh.Eventually some other guys showed up and I introduced her as the lost child she  was and they joined us for a bit. After a few sets they wanted to go and  practice for real, and I don't have that much stamina so I was looking  to head off. I asked her if she had any friends she could play with  normally and she told she doesn't at school, she was just planning on  coming to the club and seeing who she could find. This is where I  suppose I made a risky judgment call and gave her my phone number and  said to text me if she ever wanted a hit.Fast forward a few months and I would consider us friends. We go out once a  week for a hit of tennis, she tells me about her life and me about mine.  I made some calls to my junior club and managed to get her signed up as  a fill-in for some teams, and even once got her dinner once because her  parents were off god knows where.This is the main point of contention. Her parents don't know I exist and  tbh, I don't know that they exist with 100% certainty, I've never seen them nor spoken to them. They are very much absent a lot of the time  (not abusive though, I've done all the phone calls and whatnot) and I  can tell it weighs heavily on her. This makes me extremely uncomfortable  as I am well aware of the implications of hanging out with a 12 year  old girl as a 19-20 dude. At the same time though, I'm her only friend  at the moment. I've done my best to help her make new friends her own  age and with similar interests, and at some point I feel like for both  of us it's best we part ways.I just want the best for her, she's extremely intelligent and capable and  I do legitimately care for her, and only being friends with a grown ass-dude is not the best thing for her. I just wonder if cutting her off  now would make me an asshole and do more harm than good. I have asked friends and they give me a  mixture of ""what are you waiting for"" and ""how could you even think  about it"". Maybe I should wait until she makes at least one other friend?"

cdkcm8	AmItheAsshole	I (23F) recently went to a dealership to get new wipers put on my car. I was there for all of 5 minutes while a guy who worked there (late 20s M) put the wipers on. We had a short, friendly conversation and then I paid and went on my way, thinking nothing of it. However, later that evening, I received a text from a number identifying himself as the guy from the dealership. He basically said he had a great time talking to me, and was hoping that we could meet up some time to talk again in the future. This made me really uncomfortable because I never gave him my phone number. He must have gotten it from my profile with the dealership. I feel like that’s a breech of privacy on his part, and if he wanted to shoot his shot he could’ve just done it while I was there in person. So WIBTA if I report him? I would have no doubt about it if he had made me uncomfortable during our irl interaction, but we had a pleasant conversation. I don’t want to get anybody in trouble, but it just really sits the wrong way with me that he has access to so many peoples information and is willing to use it in that way.

ce3499	AmItheAsshole	"Okay, hear me out.  I saw a similar story to mine on this subreddit and I decided to make a throwaway to talk about it.  Last summer we finished building a treehouse in our back yard for my 10 year old son to play it. One day he went up there with his friend and ran to me telling me ""our neighbor doesn't have any clothes on"".  Apparently our neighbor, whose family is friends with my family, was sunbathing without a top. I used to be close friends with her husband, but we've definitely drifted apart after this whole situation.   Anyway, this happened a few more times so I told my kid to stay out of the treehouse until I could talk to her.   I texted her husband (my friend) asking if they could text me before she bathes topless in her backyard so I could make sure my kid was inside or at least out of the treehouse.   Within an hour, she came storming to my house knocking on the front door. As soon as I opened it she was screaming at me to mind my business and to tell my ""perv kid"" to keep his eyes out of their yard.   In my opinion, she completely overreacted. I didn't push it further than this though. I just boarded up the window on the treehouse that faces her yard. It was a different story for my wife on the other hand. They ended up getting into a huge argument and are no longer friends. Eventually her husband started to ignore me as well and we haven't golfed or done anything together to this day.   I feel like thanks to me our entire friendship has been ruined. I wish I would've just said nothing and boarded the window up in the first place.  AITA?"

cebttk	AmItheAsshole	"I'm almost 70 years old, my daughter is in her late 20s. I had to adopt her as I have never been able to get pregnant myself. While my daughter is married and graduated college, she is not... mentally healthy. That's just the truth.She was a deeply disturbed child. Always unhappy, always on the edge of freaking out. I tried to help, but she never wanted to hear it. She displayed some distressing traits, but not regularly enough to get it reported. She could never focus on anything and still can't. I am shocked that none of the places she's lived in her adult life have ever burned down, because she frequently started fires as a child out of negligence.She has always rushed for substances to cope with anything unpleasant in life. As a teenager, I had a suspicion that she was abusing cough syrup, but was never able to prove it. She has always drank too much. I'm sorry, but when you're regularly drinking entire bottles of wine and daily need a shot of liquor to ""fall asleep"", you have a problem. But she was ""doing well in school"" and then ""had a good job"" so I wasn't able to comment. I know now that she's likely just a functional alcoholic. She's always flirted with Xanax, but was never given a regular prescription.She always wanted children. After getting married, she actually did stop with the drugs and alcohol and got pregnant three years in. She lost the baby fairly late stage (18w). I hate to say it, but that's for the best. She and her equally...not well husband held a funeral for the child, which I of course attended. They were devastated, and for health reasons had a full year wait to try again. The year has passed and they're having the same difficulties and more. Her husband, my son in law, is a frequent flyer in the psych ward for depression issues. She's gone back to previous drinking and now takes Xanax on a daily basis. Her old medical issues that forced her on the pill are back. She is in therapy that clearly doesn't work and is always in hysterics about it. I'm sorry, but objectively, this is for the best. I'd rather go to a funeral a month for the same dead child than subject a living one to a life with these two as parents, with the high chance of inheriting it themselves.She wants to still be called a mother, which people oblige her in. I told her honestly that she needs to get herself and her partner in order before she should even think of getting pregnant and that a woman popping pills every day and washing it down with alcohol is in no way a fit parent. I'm apparently the asshole and ""don't understand pain"". Am I really the monster here?"

cel7lr	AmItheAsshole	I always wanted one of each gender when I set out to have a kid. Our goal was to have three kids total, but I wanted at least one boy, one girl, could care less what the third would be. Our first two were boys. Then we had our third and ended up with another baby boy. Don’t get me wrong, I love all my sons. I wouldn’t trade them for the world or change them and make them girls. They’re amazing, wonderful kids and we are a happy family. I cannot stress that I love these little boys more than words can say. I also know that even if I had a girl, there’s a chance that she could identify as trans in the future (and I’d be 100% okay with that). Even so, there’s a part of me that just feels like there’s something missing. I know I’d feel the same if I had three girls and no boys.My husband and I were talking, now that our youngest is 3.5 years old. I said I really felt like I wanted a little girl. He said that he felt the same. However, we knew that even though we’d love and accept a fourth boy, we wanted to do what we could to have a girl. I had heard of a process to select the gender of your child through IVF and we’ve been looking into it. We also haven’t ruled out adoption, either. Nothing is official. We’re still in the looking stages and saving stages as well, as both of these things would be costly, but it would be worth it.I was telling my mother about this, as we are very close. At first I just mentioned that we were planning on having a fourth baby, either through pregnancy or adoption. She got very excited, until I mentioned that we wanted to make sure that we would have a girl. She got upset and said that she thought it was selfish. She said that my older two sons are old enough to understand why I want that and that I’m being selfish. She said that we don’t get to pick the gender of our kids and that if I want a fourth kid, I should just go through with it. I suddenly started feeling really bad about myself.

cesd6o	AmItheAsshole	"I work at a small tech company where it's basically split between designers and project managers. I'm the admin assistant, so I do a little bit of everything until we find out what I'm good at. The others in the company come from much different experiences and life backgrounds than me. On the PM side, it's mostly women, and they love to talk about all the things they buy, travel, etc. One of them pulled me into a conversation about travel and said we should all bring in passports to compare places we've been. I said ""Oh, I've never had a passport."" She was shocked, asked me why not. I just said ""Oh, I can't really afford to travel."" She looked confused and asked about when I was growing up, where would we go on family vacations. I said we didn't and changed the subject. She kept looking at me weird after that.Then came the purse thing. I've carried the same bag with me for about 6 years. One of the girls laughed at a fraying strap and said it was time for a new one, and suggested this brand I'd never heard of that kind of matched the style. I looked it up and said ""That's a really nice one! But wow, $150 for a purse!"" She looked at me funny and said ""Do you think that's a lot...?"" I said yes, that's basically two weeks groceries for me. She was very taken aback.The ""inciting"" incident happened last week. One of the women recently started the process of buying a house. She's really excited and got her a nice candle. One of the women said that I was next, and I just said ""Haha, yeah right!"" One of the women asked when I thought I'd start looking, and I was honest and said that I don't really see home ownership as a part of my life. They were all shocked and kept trying to tell me why I was wrong, and I admit I got a little annoyed when they wouldn't drop it. I said ""With what money?""It got awkward after that, and the next day one of the women pulled me aside and told me that they're sick of the way I always have to be a downer about money, and that I always make it awkward when I talk about what I can't afford. I said ""Well, how do you think it makes me feel to have you guys constantly flaunting all the purses and high end makeup and designer clothes you're wearing."" She said that they were bonding, that's what women do, and that from now on, I should try to be more discrete about the income disparity between us. I said ""Sure, if you guys will be, so will I."" She gave me a look and said that I'm acting kind of like an asshole and punishing them for something that's not their fault.

ch8uen	legaladvice	Hey Reddit!My father was a singer and died of a stroke about 10 years ago. He was in a band in the 80s and had a big hit but signed a horrible record deal where they pretty much took all his money. I think he signed with another record deal and he had been releasing music since then. He was also performing in France and other overseas countries a lot. His music is currently on Spotify, Youtube, etc however we are not sure who put it there and who rightfully owns it. It even plays on the radio from time to time. Strangely enough, we did receive a royalty check years ago for a hefty amount, $20,000 and would like to know if there is more we are entitled to. I believe we have the name of the current record company that owns his music or at least is responsible for royalties.

ci2e9b	AmItheAsshole	"My boyfriend and I (I'm female if that matters) have been together 1 year. We live 40 minutes apart. When we spend nights together (up until last week, 5-6 nights a week) we spend them at his place because he has dogs and it's a closer commute to work for both of us. His commute is 5 minutes, mine is 10. Three weeks ago I switched jobs and now we both start work at 7 am (I can really walk in around 7:15 though). It used to be 8:30. I'm quick getting ready so I can be out the door in 20-30 minutes. This means I'd ideally wake up and shower at 6. My boyfriend though, wakes up at 5:40 and doesn't get out of the bathroom until 6:20. Every single day. That's fine. Not even an issue, still time for me to shower and get to work.Except. For whatever reason. And I will never be able to understand this. He doesn't shower until 6. Ever. Never ever. But he turns the freaking water on at 5:40 when he goes in the bathroom and let's it freaking run until 6 am. He uses the time to trim his beard (every freaking day), go pee, wake up, check his phone, whatever. Which not only is a tremendous waste of money and a fucking strain on the environment, but it means that my showers are ICE COLD. I've complained a billion times. He says that it's his routine and he's been doing it since way before he met me. He basically said that if I don't like it, wake up and take a shower before him. Which would mean waking up a full hour earlier than necessary considering there is plenty of time to get ready after him. I complained about it for two weeks, then woke up one week ago today and checked for hot water and it made me so mad that he'd done it again that I told him that I'll no longer be spending the weekdays with him because I'm not going to continue to inconvenience myself and start every morning off of a bad note with an ice cold shower over something that could easily be fixed. I offered to spend Friday and Saturday evenings with him, but have made it clear I'm going home every Sunday afternoon. For a week I've stuck to this. He texted me this morning telling me that he's looking forward to seeing me today but that he thinks I'm being very overdramatic about the situation and need to get over it before I ruin our relationship over something ""so stupid"".

ciw8o4	AmItheAsshole	I work at a summer camp where you drop your children off in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon after your work. The camp is funded from the state so the parents have to pay only about 30 USD per week while we take care of their children. It is an IT camp, children from 6-15 are taught how to work with 3D printers, build and code lego robots, make youtube videos, use computers, etc. It was required that the children have some sort of relationship to these kind of things or at least take interest in them. On wednesday we had a new kid show up because he was sick the first two days of the camp. His mother told me how he's only 6 but he's clever as a 9 year old at least. Also she told me how great he is with technology and how awesome his lego building skills are. I believed her and was very happy that we have such a kid. So I take him to the classroom and show him his computer. That's when he tells me that he doesn't know how to read and has never been on a computer, smarthphone or a tablet - basically everything this camp is about. Well, I gave him some lego robots which he could build. He came to me every 2 minutes saying that it's too hard and he can't do that. So basically there was nothing for him to do for the whole week. Later when I talked to the owner of the camp he told me that the mother signed him up for two weeks and he allowed it after she told him her lies. I was really pissed at the kid's mother for abusing the price of the camp and using it as a really cheap daycare. Me and the girl who works there with me persuaded the owner to kick the kid from the camp for the next week because there was nothing for him to do and his mother was lying about his skills.  Now my friend and my girlfriend think that I'm an asshole for this but In my opinion work with children is really exhausting and I can't give all my attention to this kid. So AITA?   tldr; Mother lied about her kid being a second coming of Albert Einstein to get him to IT summer camp. We found out he can't even read and has never used a PC.

cj19fa	AmItheAsshole	Hi, all! I’m (26F) struggling with a gym issue. I joined a gym 2 months ago and after a gym staff member became friendly with me. He has been inviting me to come to the gym near closing so we can work out together after closing to be workout buddies. I declined because I don’t want to work out alone at night with someone I don’t know and I like to workout alone. Each time, I’ve been more and more uncomfortable because he watches me workout until it looks like I’m free to talk. I politely asked him to leave me alone during workouts so he started stopping me at the door on my way out.  2 days ago, he asked me if I would be interested in joining him for lunch so we could get to know each other better. I told him I’m married but could get lunch as a friend. His face turned red and he accused me of lying because I wasn’t wearing a ring. I explained to him that my husband and I don’t wear one because we think the money is spent better elsewhere and I never mentioned I am married because it was never relevant to the conversation. He started to go on this rant about how he just knew I was the perfect woman for him and if I gave him a chance I’d also realize that. I repeated that I am happily married to X (his name is clearly Asian). He claimed as a white man he could make me happier than my Asian husband.That’s when I lost it. I am Asian and received plenty of “me love you long time” shit from all types of men all my life. Not only that, I am angry this man insulted my husband and our race. I called him a racist creep and I’d never even consider dating someone like him and I was sure his d*ck must be withered from all the steroids he’s been on to build his swollen body puffs. He walked away after that, and some other members told me I’d crossed a line. Only one person told me he could understand my anger. I’ve also been banned from the gym for being inappropriate and body-shaming (which also makes me think I may have taken it too far by what I said and I am horrified I have body-shamed someone).My husband is fully supportive of me putting in a complaint. A friend of ours told me it was harmless and the guy probably just thought I was attractive but didn’t handle rejection well and my words were hurtful to my friend (“someone like you”) because they could be confused for refusing to date a white man due race. Well, this also upset me because I don’t think our friend understands and took an unrelated situation and applied it to himself (he is a white man married to an Asian woman). He asked me to post this for judgement.AITA for insulting the gym staff member? WIBTA for reporting his previous behavior now that I’ve been banned?Thank you, I will be so appreciative of any comments.

clvbkj	legaladvice	Good day, people. Please read the story after the question for context; thanks for the legal advice.For those familiar with the Philippine laws, is there a Republic Act that states that all companies and owners of arcade game cabinets (e.g. World of Fun, Quantum Amusement, Tom's World) are required to maintain the cabinets to be updated (to the latest versions) and maintained constantly for the customers?Here's why. There is a branch of World of Fun amusement arcade in a Walter Mart mall where they have a Pump It Up Fiesta EX machine (which is already old \[8 years to be exact from this post\], because there were like 5 versions newer than this, with the newest being Pump It Up XX \[20th Anniversary Edition\]). In the last 2-3 years, the P1 and P2 pads in the cabinet were malfunctioning - with P1 pad with some or all of the buttons not working or squishy, and P2 pad either shaky when using the bar or the back buttons not working consistently. The worst part is that in those the cabinet is still there today with little to no repair, and with NO update at all; I played there every once in a while to see if the pads would be fixed at least - but they did not, which is frustrating for avid players.I brought this problem up to the branch's maintenance crew, and despite them promising to repair the pads or to upgrade the game to the newest version, they did little or nothing at all to alleviate the problem. In my opinion, they could have just pulled out the game altogether, sold the cabinet and saved tons of money so that they can either buy a new PIU game or fix the other arcade games (there are others not working as well).

Chloe's bio mom is in and out of the picture, but has only seen her a handful of times this year, and last year was the same. Chloe's mom is now with another man and has two other children (aged 1 and 2). She does not pay child support.Since we've been engaged, I've been nudging my fiance to get a paternity test for Chloe. He and Chloe's mom broke up because she was cheating on him, and he acknowledges there's a possibility Chloe isn't biologically his. I just want proof she's his before we get married.

cpvoug	personalfinance	Dear redditorsSo I am in a bit if regret, up until last week i never regretted buying my car. I was very happy that I will pay it off soon and be done with the monthly payment. I make 75k a year so and I live rent free, so making a $871 a month wasnt bad. I have always saw houses as good investment, so recently i saw a really house that was going on sale and I was 100% into it once I saw it duing open house. I really want to take out a mortgage and buy it (listed for 250k). I was doing the math and mortgage calculators online I relized that my high monthly payment on the car is literally stopping me from affording it. I have a pretty good credit score (750) My first thought was to call my bank and ask if I can refinance the car to lower the car payment but reading online, people have said that taking a new loan is just going to damage your credit score and you may not even be able to get 250k from a lender. What advice can you give me? Thanks!!	TIME	What is the interest rate on the car loan?	<RESPONSE_TIME_0_AUTHOR>	What is the interest rate on the loan?	<RESPONSE_TIME_1_AUTHOR>	author_token_model

I currently have an associates degree in communications. Unfortunately, I also have $25,000 in student loan debt from a history degree I didn't complete (through no fault of my own, I had a 4.0 throughout my 2 years there taking 24 credits a semester and was on track to graduate in 3 years).I know this is probably a pointless question that I already know the answer to but I'm naively hoping there is just some way that I've overlooked.Is there any possible way to get from my ""career"" path now to where I want to be without making myself destitute in the process or incurring even more student loans? I already know I will likely never pay off the ones I have now so I don't want even more. I am open to anything, certifications, additional associates degrees, taking classes slowly.

cri9nw	AmItheAsshole	I have a pretty decent paying job, he lost his job at McDonald’s back in early May. We have a mortgage to pay, bills, groceries, and all that normal stuff. I’ve also paid his credit card bill, traffic ticket, and put money into his overdrawn checking account. I’ve been the only one financially supporting us since he lost his job and it’s been really really stressful, especially since I detest my job and am miserable at it but I can’t afford to find a new one and take the pay cut right now.Money was becoming increasingly tight as time went on. He applied for unemployment a few weeks ago finally, but still hasn’t gotten any money from them. And he just got a job offer from the one place he applied to and starts in September.The main issue/fight:This guy is addicted to his energy drinks, he’ll have 4-6 per day and buys them two at a time from the gas station. He would just take my card from my wallet and my car without asking and go buy some and/or snacks. It got to the point where that was too much and I asked him (multiple times) to stop. I couldn’t afford it. Couldn’t even afford the gas he was using. I had to start hiding my wallet from him.Now he will be starting a new job soon, he’ll still get the backpay from those few weeks of unemployment whenever it goes through, and I was forced to work a buttload of overtime at my shitty job this past couple weeks and will be getting a pretty hefty paycheck next Friday.I’ve been really extra depressed lately, mostly due to the financial stress and hating my job, so I bought a PC game ($30) on my CREDIT CARD to give me something to keep my mind off things. Then I MENTIONED to him that I wanted to buy a cheap new PC because right now I just have a shitty old laptop. I’ve been setting aside $20-40 per paycheck for a few months to save up to eventually assist him in buying my engagement ring. I have $300 from that already, and I’d need $130 more out of my checking account to purchase all the computer parts. And again, I haven’t bought it yet, I was asking what he thought about it.His response was salty as fuck and he bitched me out for wanting to spend MY money on ME (now that I can finally afford to) but not wanting to give him $15 every single day for energy drinks anymore.. when all he’s been doing is staying at home and sleeping all day. And he said “just don’t expect me to ever spend another cent on you... except for the bills and your engagement ring whenever that happens.” I countered with “don’t even bother” and left for work.AITA?

ctvpr0	legaladvice	Posting for my brother. He lives in Texas. Recently, he was involved in an accident and the insurance company declared his vehicle (2007 Lincoln Navigator L Ultimate) a total loss. In case it matters, he was hit by another drive, but because the other driver lied to police, the police listed my brother at fault.Based on NADA/KBB/local comps, his vehicle was worth between $10,000 - $11,000, but the insurance company is only offering him $7,100. They’re using non-L (L is the designation for physically longer versions; he has 6 kids and can’t fit everyone in the standard size SUV) versions of his vehicle with fewer options as the basis for their valuation.After my brother emailed the adjuster back with the details that his vehicle is an L version, and a laundry list of options that his Navigator had that the insurance company’s comps did not have, they insist that the payout for his total is $7,100. One of the reasons they cite is that the payout is “the lesser” of either 1) what it costs to repair the vehicle or 2) what it costs to replace it. It would cost less to repair, so they insist they can only give him the repair amount.I know insurance companies are highly regulated, but he’s getting nowhere at this point.

cu2eyk	AmItheAsshole	"I met my boyfriend (2+ years) through his best friend, \*Andy, who was also a close friend of mine.  Andy is dating \*Becky.  Once when I was with my boyfriend, Andy called and I -- completely unintentionally -- overheard Andy say that he had cheated on Becky with his ex.  My boyfriend and I exchanged a glance about this.  Andy talks about his ex a lot and admits he has feelings for her.  I've been cheated on several times, and hearing that a close friend did this to someone I knew and liked admittedly upset and disappointed me.Becky is much younger than Andy and I.  In addition to the cheating, I feel that Andy is kind of a dick to her: for example, after just a couple of weeks of dating and her spending several nights, he started demanding that she pay rent and split groceries that he would buy.  She capitulated, even though Becky still has her own place, and they still do their grocery shopping separately, etc.  So, sometime in February, Becky and I start chatting on Facebook and I end the conversation with a lot of supportive generalities: ""You are so smart and beautiful.  Andy can be a dick sometimes.  You shouldn't feel insecure or think that anyone has the right to push you around.""  That kind of thing.  She thanks me effusively for being so encouraging and nice, and that's it. Months pass, and I learn that Becky has accused Andy of cheating on her, alleging that she found out because I had drunk dialed her in the beginning of May.  My boyfriend and Andy are furious at me.  However, Becky's story is conclusively not true: 1- I was out of the country, backpacking with my parents, both teetotalers, at the alleged time of the call, so I was definitely not out drinking or making weird international calls; 2- I have never had Becky's phone number; and 3- My boyfriend, at my insistence, looked at my phone records on the Verizon site during this time and was able to see that I didn't call Becky (he knows her number).   I honestly wish I'd told her about the cheating, but it seems like she's been suspicious of Andy and used me as the fall person. Andy has blocked me completely, he's poisoning our friend group, and my boyfriend -- who now believes my version of events -- refuses to give Andy my side.  He says he won't ""choose between his best friend and his girlfriend.""  I'm not asking him to choose.  I am asking him to tell Andy the truth.  AITA?"

cubq3j	AmItheAsshole	The setup: I’ve known this guy for a couple years and we’ve worked together occasionally. We’ve had a couple dates before. We split the bill without any discussion or issue. He Snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. I say sure.I forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied “pizza and a movie” and he replied “yeah see you soon!” It was just an innocent phrase but I didn’t eat that day and assumed we’d get food together.I show up and he has the movie. I say “so are we getting food?” He says “I already ate. But I’m sure you have apps on your phone if you want something.” Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.I sit there awkwardly. This guy previously talked about being a men’s rights guy. A normal one, not an incel dickhead. He also mentioned he’s low on cash. But isn’t it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? If he was too broke I’d obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn’t the vibe I got since he bragged about a new game he bought. He returns and turns on the TV and turns off all the lights. Then he goes into the kitchen, which I assume is to get alcohol. I call out casually “what do you got to drink?” He calls back “Do you like tap water?”This is not some red pill bullshit. I know this guy, he’s serious. There’s nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. I call out, “Yeah, sure.”He brings me back a glass of tap water. He winks at me.I’m starving. I haven’t eaten since 8am. I say “Hey, I don’t wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza.” He says in a sympathetic tone, “Oh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn’t clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.”This is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn’t offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. After the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he’s weird with money and I’m uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn’t think my pizza was his responsibility. Then he asks me to have sex with him.I decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.I don’t expect or need people to buy me things, but I think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners.

cv9lxs	AmItheAsshole	"So let me preface this, I don't agree with what happened as I believe recreational use of marijuana should be legal. I've been living at my current complex for about a year, it's a very small complex where everyone is cramped up together. So smells travel quickly.We have a group down the hall that always constantly stink up the hallways, and subsequently my apartment, with the skunk smell of weed. I've initially left messages asking them to try to filter it better or at least do it somewhere else. We don't have windows we can open, so there's no way them or I can let it out.After still dealing with it for a month, I spoke to management and all they did was say ""no smoking on premises"" in an email.Smells persisted.Now I have family come by alot, and I do my best to give good impressions....but with the constant smell they don't want to visit anymore since they think the complex is full of druggies.So I did the unthinkable, I filed a complaint with police on kids smoking weed. They stopped by, and essentially did a sweep of the complex. Note, this IS NOT what I requested. I just wanted them to tell the kids to do it elsewhere or just stop smoking in the complex.They busted two different tennants, one was in the process of lighting some up and apparently had a personal bag big enough to be considered distributable.The second Tennant was actively dealing from what I overheard, he was busted with a few bricks but did not actively smoke.AITA for essentially ruining these people's lives all because of a bad smell?

This is the daughter writing the update. My mom didn’t know how to do an update post and asked me to write it for her. We’re both here to respond to comments if you have any.I saw that a few people asked what my aunt’s opinion was after the verdict was given on this post! Here is the answer to that question: My aunt said that she had told my cousin from the beginning that excluding me was going to hurt my feelings and suggested to her that I be a bridesmaid instead of my mother. My cousin turned down this suggestion but would not say why. I also saw some people wondering if something had gone down between my cousin and me that I wasn’t telling my mom. This is definitely valid question! The answer is no, she and I haven’t had any problems prior to this (that I know of, at least). She has always been like a sister to me. If she ever had a problem with me or anything I’ve done I would hope she would tell me.Another question I saw was about my relationship with my father. He and I have a very tense relationship due largely to some mental heath problems that he has. Prior to all of this I had confided in my cousin a lot about this. This made her decision to include him over me hurtful in a very poignant way.After reading all of your comments and some more deliberation, my mom ended up staying in the wedding party. I appreciate her desire to stand up for me but I really did want my cousin’s wedding to go smoothly (despite my feelings being very hurt). My mom respected my wishes. She is an amazing mom all around and I am lucky to have her in my corner. After the conversation I had with my cousin (described in the last post) I was on the fence about attending the wedding. I then heard from other relatives that she was concerned that I would “sabotage the wedding” if I were to attend. I found this comment to be bizarre and confusing. At this point I decided that it would be best to remove myself from the situation entirely. I told her that I wouldn’t be attending and left it at that. It was a hard decision to make, but your reactions to the original post made me feel more confident in my choice.The wedding did end up going smoothly. I heard from multiple sources that there was plenty of extra room in the bridal suite. I wish I could have been there with my family to support her on her big day. She and I have both been part of each other’s major life milestones for as long as I can remember. I still haven’t figured out why I was the only one excluded but I have come to the conclusion that she and I must not be as close as I had always thought we were. At this point I’m not sure that I want to be. Your feedback on the original post played a large part in me realizing that.Thanks to everyone for reading and for all of your responses! We got great insight from everyone who commented (especially those with different perspectives from our own). If you guys have any more questions feel free to comment!

cz4z9j	AmItheAsshole	My dad has two small companies, one is selling/laying tiles and the other one is room rental.I started working in the first one about a year ago when I got out of school. He had a woman doing all the management for the second one but after a huge argument she left and I had to replace her (FYI, I don't have any training in that field at all). So for the past 6 months I am in charge of everything. Sales, marketing, customer service and managing the rooms. I'm his only office worker (he is responsible for the construction sites) and having to manage two companies at a time has been very stressful in the last few months. As you can imagine, when you have so many things to keep an eye on you tend to make some mistakes. And when I make them, even if they're little, I get absolutely destroyed with words. I'm not saying he's an asshole for yelling at me because let's face it, almost every boss is strict, that's how the world works and I'm not expecting to have a nice and understanding boss in my next job. Still, being called an idiot is not fun, especially when you're doing your best to keep your fathers company afloat.Now here's the thing, as a father he is actually great, he was always there for me, even after losing custody over 10 years ago when my parents divorced. You could say maybe he is doing all the yelling and inducing stress to help me become a man, and I respect that. But I can only endure it this much, I'm fresh out of school after all.He never tells me this personally but what I've heard is that he always talks about how he couldn't keep going without me, that he had to close the company if I were to quit suddenly. That's why I've already told him that I will probably quit soon and that he should start looking for someone to replace me, but so far he has not made an effort to look for new employees.I can't keep up this level of stress much longer, It's making me physically and emotionally weak. Selling tiles is something I could imagine doing, but I absolutely hate the other job. WIBTA if I quit the job, risking the company?TL;DR: Working 2 jobs at a time with maximum responsibility and high stress. Thinking about quitting it, meaning the company could go bankrupt.

czaetj	AmItheAsshole	So I recently saw a post that described an issue similar to the one my girlfriend and I are having right now, so I figured I'd share.For context, I'm a guy who tries my best to keep it pretty clean. Thankfully I'm not naturally very hairy, and regularly shave my arms, legs, chest, and armpits (partly due to personal preference, and partly the result of habits I developed when I swam in college).I also just cannot stand body hair on women. Sorry if that statement makes me an asshole, but I just can't get over it. Yes I understand women can do what they want with their bodies, and I respect their decision if they choose not to shave. But no amount of posturing is going to sway me on this one (and I think most guys would admit to feeling the same if you put a gun to their head). So I feel that if I keep myself clean shaven, I'd have more of a leg to stand on if I were to ask a woman to do the same. Anywho my girlfriend and I have recently arrived at that stage where we are living together and are comfortable being disgusting around each other (shitting while the other's brushing their teeth, etc.). She's also stopped shaving her armpits as frequently, which has really gotten on my nerves. I politely told her that this is an issue for me, and asked if she would shave more often. She replied by saying that it's 2019, and that women shouldn't be stigmatized for having body hair. Yea I suppose she's right, but it still bothers me, so I am refusing to shave my ass/around my asshole until she relents, which has in turn really gotten on her nerves. She thinks I'm an asshole, but I'm merely trying to get her to see things from my perspective.

All those fucking doctors, healthy living and it comes back. The worst part is that it's looking like a worse case scenario.

czn08t	AmItheAsshole	My ex and I were high school sweethearts and we were together for around 6 years. We started dating in high school and we stayed together in uni since we were in the same city, then we broke up a few months after we graduated. If it matters, I broke up with him. This was in 2012 and we literally haven't seen each other or talked since but we still have some mutual friends from high school and uni.One of those mutual friends got married last month and I was in the wedding party. When he and his fiance were putting together the guest list I asked them not to invite my ex. Weddings are hard enough when you're single and I really just wanted to celebrate and enjoy my friend's wedding in peace. I didn't want to stress about running into my ex and his new wife all night. They understood and they did not invite my ex to their wedding. Recently I was hanging out with some friends and my ex got brought up and someone asked why he missed the wedding. The bride explained he wasn't invited because of me. I saw some of the other people exchange glances with each other like it was weird. But no one actually said anything to me.One of my best friend is getting married at the end of the year on NYE and I'm a bridesmaid and I asked her to not invite my ex to her wedding for the same reasons. They haven't sent out invitations yet but as far as I know he will not be invited.I feel like since I'm in the wedding party it's not unfair of me to ask my friends for this favor so I don't feel uncomfortable. I probably wouldn't have asked them if I was just a regular guest. Also I'm much closer friends with the couples getting married than my ex is and I think if they really wanted him to be there then they wouldn't have uninvited him just because I asked.

cznr3c	Advice	We were having a discussion about dealbreakers, sexual preferences and things like that. We were both a little drunk and I though this could be a good moment because I wanted to hear opinion about that from someone close to me for a long time now. I told him I'd lose attraction to my partner for crying, showing weakness (more like mental instead of physical) and opening up about some personal trauma or past abuse to the point I'd consider breaking up with him.He when freaked out and basically now thinks I'm asshole who lacks empathy. I wanted to tell him that these are my preferences and it doesn't reflect on my opinions and believes about people with traumas, past abuses or anything. I can be fully supportive and empathetic to my male and female friends and relatives, but if we are talking about sexual preferences that just means I will probably never have sex with him again.I mean I can hold my partner back for a few minutes and let him cry but after that I cant seem him the way I used to. And even when, if I get tired of him I'd just grab him and bring him outside if that was my place or leave if it's his place. I admit I would have much less patience if my boyfriend broke down instead of a friend or a relative. I'm 37. am I the asshole?

d0rwl9	AmItheAsshole	My friend and I both have a moderately dark/edgy sense of humor, and often joke around when we're hanging out. We have a handful of youtubers we both like who make similarly edgy jokes as well, and we often reference stuff we found funny from their videos, mostly just because it makes us laugh.My friend shares an apartment with a good friend of his and said friend's girlfriend of several years. I've never gotten into it with either of them before, we're not particularly close but have generally had a decently friendly relationship. The other week we were hanging out at his place, and naturally, some edgy jokes came up, nothing out of the ordinary for us.Generally whenever I'm hanging out at his place, both his roommates are out of the house, so we normally don't have to worry about bothering them, but his friend's GF happened to be in the house for part of the time I was over. We tried to keep things a bit quieter so as not to bother her, but apparently she overheard a few jokes we said from the other room, and got pretty upset, though we didn't find out about this until later.None of the jokes we make are intentionally mean-spirited, everything's all generally good natured. I do understand why she might have felt uncomfortable by some of the jokes, not everyone shares our sense of humor, and tried to apologize for anything that she overheard that might have upset her, but she didn't want to hear it. I'm apparently now barred from going to their apartment ever again, and not welcome at any group activities in that friend group anymore. She's insi My friend is also under a lot of heat for what happened, he's told me things have been pretty tense around the apartment and that she's trying to convince her boyfriend to kick him out (he's been really removed from the whole situation and I feel like he just doesn't want to get more involved than he has to), which I feel really bad over.I never meant for anyone to get hurt and only planned to keep the more edgy humor in private between us, but she's insisting that the jokes we make are completely unacceptable. I don't think anything we said was nearly as bad as she's making it out to be, but given how upset she is, I really don't know what to think anymore. Am I the asshole?

d1btlg	AmItheAsshole	I’m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don’t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I’m assuming my dad has told her I’m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I’m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. I just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I’m justified in saying no.

d1p5q1	Advice	"I really haven't been this depressed in a while. To start with a little context; all my life I've thought of my father as a kind, hard working and honest man that wanted nothing for the best for his family. Unfortunately my perception of him has changed recently though a part of me still believes this. My older brother has always had problems with our dad. Various different things over the years some my brothers fault and some dads. I never really understood. It was only until the last year or so where my brother (26) had really started hating dad even disowning him as a   father which broke dad's heart. I'd always be on dads side as I didn't fully understand why my brother would overreact like that. My brother won't ever speak to him again as he is known to hold a grudge. It's only now I know the reason but I'm getting there. Dad and mum split up 10 years ago and about 6 months after that Mum moved in with a new boyfriend. They were technically still married. One night Dad showed up to their place (boyfriend wasnt home) and proceeded to rape my Mother. I had no idea what happened at the time as I was 9 but my brother was the one who told me this recently. How he found is complicated. I straight up did not believe him at the time and thought he was making stupid and wild accusations out of his hate for dad. I was completely convinced my own father would be incapable of doing something like this as I thought him as the most honorable and loving man. In some respects he still is and has always been a great father to his sons which make this more difficult for me. I live with Mum these days and Dad lives a few hours drive a way. Before this I kept in contact with him. Anyways I asked mum next to hear the truth. I know I shouldn't have brought the memory back up with her but I needed to know. She confirms it did happen as in her words ""he felt it was his given right"" because they were still married. I said it's no ones right to rape anyone. I was so angry. Keep In mind this happened 10 years ago and they still spoke afterwards. She just accepted it and moved on with her life after and I can't fault her for that. I haven't dealt with dad yet and he's been trying to call me as I haven't spoken to him in a while. I'm scared to face him. He doesn't know I know and mum said to just leave it. How can I but? He's a different person In my mind now and I can't speak to him like nothing happened. I know it happened a long time ago but still? I'm quite depressed and I don't know what the right thing to do is. I finally understand my brother now and his resentment but don't know if that's the way I should act. This is why I've posted here today. I'm not quite sure. Right now I just need help and to speak with some people about this and to hear some outside opinions/advice. Also thank you for reading."

d2fq6q	AmItheAsshole	I feel pretty comfortable with it but some recent posts in r/insaneparents have me questioning myself. Backstory: I have three teenagers and they are all GOOD. Like, they talk to me, don’t lie or sneak etc. (that I know of, of course, but I’m pretty sure). We have very open relationships, they are good students, have jobs, talk to me if they are going to a party where people are drinking etc and never ever drive under the influence. I have a full time job and sometimes we don’t connect until nighttime. So. I love having them on location services for a couple of reasons. First of all, i don’t want to be a helicopter parent who says “where are you” all the time. A quick check lets me know my son is at work or my daughter is at a friend’s house and then I don’t bother them. No calls or texts, all is well. I also think about how fast we move around and if something bad happened I’d be able to find them ASAP. One of my kids was in a car accident and I was able to get there immediately without having to ask for directions. Another kid went off to college and it gives me so much pleasure to see him in another city without getting in his face and asking what he’s doing. It makes me feel connected without bothering him. That said, a lot of people are saying this is a huge invasion of privacy for a young adult. None of my kids seems to mind (maybe because it makes me call them less?) but people online seem to think it’s horrible. so... AITA?

She tells me i am being financially irresponible and why wasn't she consulted. My response was its my money and we have seperate finances. At the end of the day  it should be my choice. It would be different if she was sacrficing her career so I can earn more then i would understand but we both have our careers and we both do the same amount of work around the house.

d3cizk	AmItheAsshole	"My mom and I are planning on living together. Here is some backstory.  I am 19 years old. We're having to move out because my step dad recently passed away from cancer. And this is his house, and how he left the will we won't be able to live here anyways. So we need an apartment. She wants me to put bills in my name (ex. Lease, Utilities) My moms credit is fucked up because she took all of the bills from my dad when they divorced to ""keep the peace"" while also taking the minimum amount of child support possible. My mom has alienated me from my dad, and made him sound like the bad guy a lot through my life. She even has to mention every time about my $8,000 hospital bill from when she put me in the mental institution. (Lots of childhood trauma I went through)  I just start training on my job this Monday and I need money to pay for a TB test and a money order for the application. I gave my mom all of my money ($70, I do landscaping to get money for now) for the cable bill that was overdue, and it was shut off. I also gave some money for the electric bill. And trying to give her to spare me $40 for all of this was like pulling teeth. She's borrowed money from her boss, coworkers, friends, family and it's easily like $800+ right there. She doesn't have to worry about the mortgage. Only cable, electric and a car payment. So I expected her to be able to help me out for this job I need if I want to support us. I've given my mom over $2000 easily from a college grant last year (I'll talk about that later. I couldn't go to college for a lot of reasons that were out of my reach) When she handed it to me, she asked me to run to the store and get her cigarettes, and drinks and toilet paper. So I told her no. She tried to take it back but I demanded that I need it for my job. She then threatened and said for me to live with my dad. She did this before to hurt me because I used to not talk to him. (again, alienation so I thought he was the bad guy)  If I live with my dad I have a promised place to live, and not worry about bills being in my name, and overall my credit can start to be built. My dad just wants me to pay off the other half of the car he gave me, my insurance, and some money for bills so we both can live comfortably. I have the moral dilemma because of how vulnerable she is. Am I the asshole? I can give more backstory if need be."

d4grrh	AmItheAsshole	live with my best friend and his girlfriend in a 2 bedroom apartment.Everything has always been smooth and our arrangement works out fine for the most part, everyone split rent evenly. We have 2 bathrooms so one they use in their room and I took over the other one.Last night it was my turn to do laundry and I needed to switch everything over but my boy’s gf still had clothes in the dryer. She was at work and forgot so she texted me if I can just dump her clothes on top of the dryer and she will take care of it later.I had no problem with this but when I started taking her clothes out I saw these button pad things in there. I was kinda weirded out because they looked like diapers so when she got home I asked her what those are for.She told me they are washable pads. Like for her period. I wasn’t mean or tried to be rude but I asked her if she’s seriously washing used bloody pads in our communal laundry. She said yes. I was honest and told her that’s a little gross and that I thought pads were meant to be disposable for a reason. She got upset and said there’s no reason why she shouldn’t wash them with the rest of her clothes and if I expected her to go to a laundromat. I told her no of course not but maybe to hand wash them next time in her bathroom.She told her bf about it and he said I crossed a line and to apologize. Just to keep the peace I did but she’s been giving me attitude since. I don’t think it was unreasonable to ask her to just clean them in her bathroom because they are essentially covered in blood. I would never ask her to pay money or make a trip to go to the laundromat but at least wash private things like that in private. I’ve always been uncomfortable with blood and it makes me uneasy.

d59br7	AmItheAsshole	I (22f) and my friend (21f) recently booked an Airbnb apartment for a week long holiday to the beach. We both brought along our boyfriends, who we have both been with for around 3 years. We talk often about sex, what we're up to, issues if we have any, just normal girl stuff. I've confided in her before that me and my boyfriend don't really have sex anymore because of work and he's on antidepressants, and it really gets me down. The last time I told her about this was a couple of months ago. She often tells me little funny things that happened while she was having sex, and if anything happens to me, I tell her too. When we went on holiday, I assumed that she wouldn't be having sex with her partner.  My boyfriend has always made it clear he finds it weird to have sex in hotels/not his own house or mine, and he was my first partner so I assumed it was a normal view. I have to admit, I also didn't want to risk hearing her have sex because I'm really insecure that I'm not, and also because, to be honest, I feel like my relationship is going downhill and I'm jealous that after the same amount of time, her relationship is near perfect (from her own words). I think it's normal for relationships to not be as exciting and sexy as they were at the start and I honestly think that because hers seems to be, they're probably forcing it or actually unhappy. Anyway, the first night we were away I went downstairs for a glass of water (their room was ground floor, ours first) and I heard quiet moans from their room. I was immediately super pissed. I had tried it on with my bf in the shower earlier (I thought he would be ok with that because the mess would just wash away) but it hadn't worked. Without really thinking I opened the door and told them to shut the fuck up. She immediately looked horrified and covered up, and said they weren't being loud. I rolled my eyes and said that it was 'gross, disrespectful to me, and honestly just weird' and then went to bed.

They got back to me within a few days saying repairs are done and it's been shipped, awesome! Come the day the GPU arrives at my doorstep and to my surprise, it's still broken! So here I'm trying to explain to ASUS that it's still broken, and the only option I have is to pay shipping a second time for them to check for problems again?

d9m02m	AmItheAsshole	About two months ago, my husband and I got “married” in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it’s their only daughter’s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn’t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he “proposed” (something I didn’t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren’t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn’t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I’ll call her Carol) and I aren’t close. She’s fine enough in low doses, but...We’re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must’ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a “gift grab” (our wedding website stated that someone’s presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband’s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I’ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes.

dc5tr3	AmItheAsshole	wife makes about 55k a year (teacher) and I make a little more than her. right now she still owes quite a bit for student loans but nothing too crazy. in the 20ks. she’s been feening to shake the debt off, and she feels like it has a hold on her even though it’s not that much compared to what I notice from other people I have talked too. so I inherited money because of property sold in the country my family is originally from, and the amount I’m getting is more than enough to cover her loans. she wants me to pay at least 30-50% of the what she owes. I on the other hand don’t really want too, money’s mine, if I was making a ton of money of course I’d take of it, I am getting more than enough to cover it, but she’s not happy with me at the moment. “you’re my husband, you should not want me to owe money like this and should want it to go away, because I would do the same for you”. No kids either... but expecting. Have to think about the little one too. Am I really obligated to take of her loans?

dgkgu6	AmItheAsshole	I’ve been with my boyfriend for a couple years and normally we get on wonderfully and there’s 0 clash of personality. One of the things that we don’t always see eye to eye on is food- I love to cook and experiment with food, and he is very much a meat and potatoes kinda guy. I recently ate a steak that was well done that tasted REALLY good. I know there’s going to be a lot of people turning their noses up and saying ‘impossible’ but honestly, it was delicious and I wanted to try and recreate it at home. I asked my boyfriend if he would be interested if I purchased some steaks and I specified it was an experiment to give the well done steak a try at home. He said he was on board. On the day of I prepped and was ready to go. At the last minute he decided he wanted it rare. I was super disappointed and irritated because I wouldn’t have ordinarily bought the steaks midweek, it was specially to give this a try- and I was excited because I thought he could try it and I had a feeling he’d enjoy it.I said I was NOT preparing him a rare steak. I said if he wanted to cook his own steak rare that was fine but I had been excited to prepare this for him. I ended up cooking my own steak and he ended up making his own. He’s been telling everyone and anyone that I’m petty and should have just accepted that he changed his mind.

dh9dfp	AmItheAsshole	My boyfriend and I [both 25M] have been dating for almost a decade. For the most part, our relationship is pretty great. But my boyfriend is a very sensitive person and has a lot of emotional baggage. He’s had a bit of a difficult life and can get spun out over minor inconveniences pretty easily. This is not usually in a toxic “taking it out on me/others” kind of way; more so he becomes too upset to function normally and needs a lot of support/comfort. This especially happens in the Fall, since he’s experienced a lot of loss around this time of year and tends to be a bit fragile.Every year, he visits his grandfather’s grave on what would have been his grandfather’s birthday. The grandfather passed when we were in high school (so about 7 years ago) and I attended the funeral at the time. Several years have passed, but they were close so my boyfriend always tends to get pretty upset around this time of year.Skipping forward to this week, my boyfriend had a very bad day at work and was spinning out about how he hates this time of year and how he was upset. As usual, I was giving him an outlet and trying to cheer him up. While doing so, he asked if I would visit his grandfather’s grave with him and his mother this weekend. As mentioned earlier, I had attended the funeral 7 years prior. But I had never gone to (nor been asked to) go to the grave with him before.I told him him that I would prefer not to visit the grave with him and that doing so would make me uncomfortable. He asked me to clarify, so I explained I’m not a big fan of cemeteries (not that I’m creeped out by them, but just being there makes me uncomfortable and I feel no connection to the deceased by being there) and that I don’t even go to my own deceased family’s graves. I also explained that I’ve been stretched pretty thin at work lately (which he is aware of) and didn’t want to give up 3-4 hours of my weekend.We didn’t have a big blowout over it or anything. But we did have a back-and-forth where he said he could use the support from me and I explained that I felt like I’ve given him a lot of support these last few weeks and that I need to draw the line at some point if supporting him puts me in an uncomfortable position. He understood that, but wished I hadn’t drawn that line at this particular instance.The conversation ended here and we’ve been fine since (it’s been a few days). But he will be visiting the grave this morning and I am worried he might come back resenting that I wasn’t there.I don’t want to misrepresent my boyfriend as an emotional vampire. He’s definitely always there for me when I’m upset (which is admittedly less often than he is upset). And I also want to make clear that he is not an emotional wreck all of the time, though he has definitely been a lot more fragile these last two months.So AITA for not just sucking it up and going to the grave with him?

dhrhuw	AmItheAsshole	Healthy eating is super important to me. I have small children at home, and a large part of my mental space is occupied by thinking about how I can ensure that my family has a generally healthy diet. I'm not completely obsessed. The kids eat cake and ice cream at parties. We take them out to ice cream now and then. I give them a few pieces of chocolate in their lunches. We do a special breakfast once a week where the kids can vote on pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc. But I see healthy eating as one of the most important values that I can instill in my family.The kids usually choose crepes for their special breakfast. These are the richest and least healthy option. I make pancakes and waffles with wheat and oat flour, but crepes I do by our traditional family recipe--butter, sugar, white flour… It's a special treat, and I want them to enjoy it. The only filling we use is pure maple syrup, and the one thing I ask is that we don't use a ton of it. Crepe batter is super rich, maple syrup has lots of sugar, and it is very expensive. I tell them a little goes a long way. Plus, it's healthier to use just a little!We roll our crepes like a burrito, and just like putting ingredients in a burrito, I ask everyone to apply a single line of syrup down the center along the roll rather than pouring haphazardly all over the surface. Not only does it help us use less, but it’s reasonable given the burrito roll method. (When you cut it into small sections, each bite will have the same amount of syrup in the center.) The kids get the rationale, and I make sure that I lead by example.My wife can't get behind the single line of syrup thing though. She likes sweet things and uses lots of syrup on her crepes. She pours in a spiral over the whole surface, using about 3x what anyone else does. For a long time, when she helped the kids fill their crepes, she refused to pour a single line, instead slathering syrup all over. I think it was a sort of protest, as she sees me as being too nitpicky. After a lot of complaining on my part, she did change, but it was a real headache.I want her to jump on board with the syrup thing so that we can send a consistent message to the kids. I have suggested this to her on various occasions and explained my reasoning carefully. I don't think it's unreasonable or irrational to think that we should have a family policy around this, and I have trouble understanding why this should represent a significant problem for her.She thinks I'm being unreasonable and irrational in asking this of her--that it's purely a matter of preference and that I shouldn't be pressuring her in any direction. I want us to be a team on this. This is the only breakfast for which I feel the need to have such family standards--I don't say anything specific about pancakes, waffles, etc. (you need to spread syrup all over the surface of those, although I do still want people to be modest about syrup use).AITA?

dk2rkt	AmItheAsshole	"Ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.Rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. She would make noises in between conversations like ""Bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""Awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. This is especially embarrassing when I am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. I have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. I have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.It was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. We went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:""Yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah.

dll9bx	AmItheAsshole	"I have three kids, two boys aged 20 and 19, and a daughter aged 24. My ex husband is still very close with us and we remain basically best friends. We all planned a vacation together to cape cod, but we sort of came to the conclusion that we shouldn't invite my daughter Laura. Laura... she can be a mean person. She is quick to anger and can be extremely demanding to others (especially aimed at her two brothers) and sometimes even just a night out to dinner with her can be hard to get through because of the way she acts. I just wanna give a quick example, we went to my cousins wedding and had to sleep over my sisters house the night before. My son had a blanket on the couch, and left it there while he went to go make breakfast. Laura, when she woke up, looked at the blanket, then asked him furiously ""are you going to fucking pick this up? You're just going to fucking leave this here like some slob? Pick it the fuck up"" at a volume that most of the people in the house could hear. My son doesn't even want to talk back to her for fear of escalating her anger, so he just did it. Another example is that my son left a pan in the sink to soak before washing it, and she flipped a shit and started calling him lazy and a brat and all this stuff. Over one pan. One time she asked my husband to do Yoga and he didn't want to, and she basically started berating him for being unhealthy and making his refusal to do yoga into this big thing. One time my son was having a migraine and had to cancel going to his aunts dinner, and Laura just absolutely berated him and insulted him for not 'sucking the pain up and going'. That is a microcosm of how she acts, not only to them, but to us as well, and her boyfriends and friends. If she finds even the slightest thing wrong with someone, she will point it out, viciously. She can also be funny and charming and talkative! She isn't all bad. But she seems to have a problem when it comes to not being able to keep quiet over even slight things she finds annoying. We want to have a fun vacation. But the thought of being with her for a week makes us all groan. It only takes one of her 'attacks' at us to really dampen the mood, especially when she starts insulting peoples characters and demeaning them. Me and my husband try to calm her down and tell her she's being irrational but there's no point at all, she just aims it at us and escalates further. So we aren't telling her we're going. We're just gonna go. Are we the asshole for this? For basically abandoning our daughter to go on vacation without her? She would 100% be excited to go if we asked her, and she only lives 2 hours away from where we're going (we live in nyc, she lives in providence (but spends half her year in nyc). It sucks, because I do love her, but I also don't want to ruin a family vacation. I keep thinking how much fun it'll be to go with just the boys, and how awful it will be to go with her... but also how bad it is to not invite my own daughter."

To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david. The school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a ""normal"" class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david. Well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. I woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her. I just want my son to have a good party and didn't mean anything by this. AITA?"

e52boc	AmItheAsshole	I am 38F. I have been married for 2 years to my husband, 57M. We have 1 baby together (2M) and he has 4 kids (11M, 19F, 20M, and 23M) from his previous wife, who passed away 7 years ago shortly after they divorced.To help me out with my baby son, I hired a nanny (55F) who also used to take care of my stepchildren when they were younger. She lives in with us through the week and sometimes the weekend. She is splendid, very nurturing. However sometimes she can be a bit too overly familiar.My youngest stepchild is 11 years old. He is a very smart, well-behaved child who attends boarding school, and has done so for the past 3 years. Sunday (yesterday) was his birthday, and on Friday I asked the nanny if she could drive down to his school and take him home for the weekend. She agreed, and he came home, we threw a party for him.Before he left, I noticed that he had a toy from McDonalds in his book bag. I asked when he went to McDonalds, as there are none near his school. He told me that the nanny took him to McDonalds on Friday after she picked him up, and that she even drove him to her family’s house (about midway between our home and the school) for a quick visit with her family and kids.I asked him why he did not tell me, and he said “I didn’t think I needed to tell you.” I let it go with him but afterwards, spoke privately with the nanny about how it’s inappropriate for her to take my stepson to places without letting me know. Plus, I told her that if he was hungry, they should have just eaten at the school instead of going to somewhere as unhealthy as McDonalds.   I don’t think I was harsh with her at all. It just a gentle reminder more than anything, but then she teared up and said she “feels sorry for him”. I said he’s perfectly happy at school, he’s a very privileged kid and that there’s no reason to feel bad for him. Now there’s a bit of tension between us.

I have a boyfriend of about a year and a half. He comes over/sleeps over about three days a week. He’s a shift worker so he gets off around 2 pm and sometimes I am not home at that time. So occasionally I’ll give him my key the day before. One of these days my roommate was home and was alarmed he had a key. I explained the situation to her and she said that if he was going to stay over a lot, she was uncomfortable and that he would need to pitch in for rent. I felt like both of these requests were slightly ridiculous. When we moved in together, I told her my boyfriend comes over often (although she claims I said two days a week). Additionally, he’s in my room 99% of the time. It’s not like he’s hanging out in the living room or taking her food or anything crazy. However, I am not a confrontational person and, in the moment, I agreed he would only comeover two days a week. I want to value her being comfortable and maintain that relationship. That being said, I pay just as much rent as she does and do just as much upkeep around the apartment as she does.

They asked me for my banking info to wire the funds to my account but then said their bank refused the transaction because my bank requires wires to go through an intermediary bank first. After doing some research it seems that all U.S banks have to use an intermediary bank for international transfers? Can anyone confirm this? Are there any U.S banks that receive international wires directly with no intermediary?  The only other option the law firm has given me is to have a bank draft couriered to me. This scares me for two reasons:  1. What happens if the bank draft goes missing en route? Does all that money just disappear with it?2. Is an American bank just going to allow me to walk into a branch and deposit a large amount of money drawn on a foreign bank?

ea4hnu	AmItheAsshole	"My (20) girlfriend (21) has a very severe phobia of cold things. We live in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.It's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is ""ridiculous"", and she needs to ""get some therapy"" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know how she intends to get through life like this.She was extremely upset and told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she tried to get some help. Just to add, she is okay going outside in the cold air, but as usual won't touch anything cold."

eayhjt	Advice	Context: So we're on a college vacation as of right now.And its not been going smoothly and theirs quite a few frustrations going around. The trip organisation isn't that good.So, today we're in a small bus. 16 people. Our group consists of 8 people. The other 8 people included the driver and one of our professors.So my best friend is a real talkative person. And she likes to blabber on and on... And she likes to be really social... Since its a long journey, she had entrusted her snack bag to us. And due to unfortunate circumstances, she was shifted to a different car/vehicle. So we kinda snacked on some of her stuff. She doesn't have a problem with it tbh. She loves to pamper us..But as i said, shes social. And today when she found out we had emptied quite a handful of her stuff she started to tease us in front of everyone.Saying that *oh my god how can you do something like this! You could've asked me! This food was for everyone! How can you eat everything all by yourselves you bunch of thieves!* And stuff. In front of everyone. All the while, she was taking it rather with a chill. Like laughing and having fun while saying this. Ofcourse she didn't mean any of that. But my other friends took it seriously. And now they're really pissed at her. Two of them especially were in a pissy mood when this happened, and that kinda elevated the situation. So they're like *I'm not gonna eat anything that she gives.* Or *I'm never eating anything she cooks*., Etc etc.I dont know if they're really serious about this.. cause as i said, shes a sweetheart. But having quite a show like this just for the sake of social interaction made them a little pissy..I really dont want her to get isolated. Or a target. Cause we've had to deal with enough shit in our college life...I really dont know if i can reason with them. And i dont know if i should tell this to my bestie. What should i do?I need an advice ASAP...	EXPERT	What should I do?	<EXPERT_PCT_1_AUTHOR>	How can you eat all by yourselves that she gives *you* food?	<EXPERT_PCT_0_AUTHOR>	author_token_model
ebjcyh	AmItheAsshole	I sound like a real asshole but I've completely lost my mind over this.I'm 17 and my stepbrother is 17. We both have our driving license.I just found out 5 days ago that my dad and stepmom bought a used car for my stepbrother. They got me a 600 dollar gift card to best buy. I know $600 is a lot of money but what the fuck? Am I crazy or is it super unfair? It's literally the straw that broke the goddamn camel's back.I'm actually so pissed off that I've moved to my mom's house full time.My dad seems to be genuinely sorry and told me he's looking for a car now but that it'll take a while.I messaged him back saying that I'll decide if I want to see him after he decides to be fair for once. I've ignored all other calls and messages from him since.My stepbrother messaged me saying that I need to chill out and that he'll let me use his car. He also said that I need to stop bitching and ruining everyone's Christmas. I told him to get in his civic and fuck off.AITA?

eennei	personalfinance	Hi PF,My SO and I both work from home. He plans to continue WFH for the foreseeable future. I will be for at least the next year, probably longer. We have two paid off cars: A 2011 Kia Soul with about 30k miles and a 2011 Scion XB with about 120k miles. I thought of selling the XB (the market tells me I'll be able to sell it for between $5-$8k) to bolster our savings since we really don't need 2 cars just sitting there, especially since we pay insurance on both. What would you do in this situation?	TIME	How stable is your job?	<RESPONSE_TIME_1_AUTHOR>	Do you have a 6 month emergency fund?	<RESPONSE_TIME_0_AUTHOR>	author_token_model
eerl33	AmItheAsshole	So I (21F) am in my junior year of college. I’ve been extremely careful on not getting pregnant and have tried all avanues. My IUD moved and I almost died so I had to get it removed, the implant in my arm left a rash and started to burn so I had it removed, so me and my FWB started using the calendar and condom method which is basically when I’m not ovulating we would use the pull out method and when I was we would use a condom and a Plan B just for backup.Well, I’m pregnant. I found out in the beginning of December that I am four weeks along. I knew immediately I didn’t want to keep the baby. I considered going through with an abortion via the pill. I got them but couldn’t do it. I know that it was selfish, but until you’re in those shoes you never know how it truly feels.So I decided adoption. I told my friend that I was planning on delivering the baby and she told me about her brother and her sister in law back in her home state that have been struggling with infertility and have been desperately trying to conceive a baby for years without fail. We FaceTimed a few times and I think they would be perfect parents for my baby. They’re both well educated with well paying jobs and an amazing home they could raise a baby in. It actually made me excited to be able to know that the baby will go to a family that so desperately wants them. I decided they would be a great fit and since they’re so far away, it’s like it never happened kinda thing.I finally brought it up to my mom yesterday that I’m pregnant and everything else. My moms first words were “What about Sylvia? Her and Jon would love a baby”. My older stepsister is 28 and infertile. She’s known this for years and we aren’t that close so I didn’t know if she ever planned on having a baby through other means.I said no. Sylvia lives in the same city as me and I see her during holidays and any other family gatherings. I don’t want to adopt the baby into my own family circle and still have to be in some form of its life. I would basically become the step aunt? I just prefer the idea of having a closed adoption in a far away state with a picture every once in a while. My mom started gushing and called Sylvia immediately despite my protests who seemed really happy. She told my mom they were looking into an egg donor and a surrogate but this baby is so much less expensive and less of a hassle.I told Sylvia that I don’t want to give the baby to her for the reasons I listed above and kind of already “promised” another couple that they could adopt the baby. Now I haven’t went through any legal channels via the other couple so it’s not like I HAVE to do it, but I really want to. Sylvia got upset and asked why I would choose a random couple that I know nothing about versus my own “flesh and blood” (Our parents have only been married for 3 years and we never lived under the same roof as she was 25 then). She and my mom both called me assholes.

ef23l3	personalfinance	I apologize in advance if this isn't the correct place to post!&amp;#x200B;I'm 23 years old and planning on buying a house in the next 5-10 years. My question is would it be a good idea to create and treat a Roth IRA solely as a down payment savings account? I'm already contributing/employer match to a 401k for retirement. My reasoning is it seems like a no-brainer if you can withdrawal your contribution plus the interest with no penalty or taxes for a first time home buyer. After the 5-10 years and I buy a house, I would then start to treat the Roth as another retirement account with my 401k.&amp;#x200B;Would this be a good option, or would I be better off using another method for saving for a home?&amp;#x200B;Any advice is appreciated!

efe8fg	personalfinance	"Hi all,just a question I was wondering about recently as I am no expert on cars. Lets say I buy a car for 50k, how would I value / capitalize / depreciate my car overtime? The main questions are the following (assume that no accident / major damage has ever occurred):1. how much value does the car lose in value immediately after purchase (thus a certain part of the purchase price was normally the profit margin for the dealer, how much would that be)2. lets say I never use the car after purchase, at what rate would the car lose value (assume I still take care of the car in the sense that I drive it from time to time so for example the battery doesn't die. This implies an abnormal use of the car, but I am asking this simply as a means of control).3. Lets say I use the car normally, does the car lose value by kilometer / mile, or rather by its age or do the two factors interact?4. Is there a ""terminal value"" of the car where the car still has like a rest value and is no longer really losing value or rather the loss in value is marginal after that point?5. Is there something else I should consider that I did not write here?"

ei904z	legaladvice	"I've used a throwaway account to make this post as anonymous as it can be because I'm lost and I don't know what to do at this point. I'm desperate and fearing for my safety (my mom is not taking this as seriously as I am).They've been married roughly ten years but separated for I'd say about one. Since then, he has become very financially abusive. He's threatened to kick us out of our place ***at least*** three times and turn off our cell phones more than that. My mom said he has always spied on her (early in their relationship he used to tape record her in the car) but since his name is on the phone bill account, he was able to go through the numbers my mom has called and ask them what their relationship is to her. She says she's caught him stalking her (no pictures of this) multiple times since he moved out. One time during an argument he told me to my face that my mom is a lying bitch and has instigated fights with her in front of my little sister whom he is the father of even though my mom tried to walk away. There are many different instances (he gave my mom a black eye once during a mutual altercation) I can go into but I'm trying to stay as vague as possible for fear of this backfiring on my mom and her case in any way. I don't think they've begun the formal divorce process. He also has a card to posses a firearm. The last time I checked, he has one in his possession however my mom says otherwise.Today, however, my mom confronted him about some precarious information she found about him and he has called me over 18 times, sent me a threatening text to once again cut off our phones (he uses the words ""tell her to stop playing with me"" though which scared me to no end), and has been stalking around our house for three hours now. He banged on the doors and windows. I suspect he's still out there as I'm typing this.I'm truly stuck here. My mom is not taking these things seriously. I'll admit, I have always been very anxious about/around men since I read a lot of stories about domestic violence ending in death and step-father's killing their families, but this seems like a textbook case for disaster. I'm not sure if any of this warrants an order of protection, I think it does, but I'd appreciate it if anyone can comment on that. Also, what further steps I can take to protect my family. Also, I don't know if this questions fits here, but is there a way we can keep our phone numbers without going through him first? **CHICAGO, ILLINOIS**"	TIME	Do you live with your mother?	<RESPONSE_TIME_1_AUTHOR>	Do you live in his house?	<RESPONSE_TIME_0_AUTHOR>	author_token_model
