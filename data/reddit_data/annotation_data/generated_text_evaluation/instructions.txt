# Generated text evaluation

1. Read each post ("post") and the questions that were generated in response to the posts ("question_1" and "question_2), in text_quality_annotation_data.tsv. Then, decide which question is better according to the following criteria:
- Fluency
	- Example post: "I got offered a job on the border of South Dakota and Minnesota. From various real estate sites, it seems that similar houses are considerably cheaper in Minnesota. Are there any reasons I should not look at Minnesota as an option?"
	    - Q1: "How long do you plan to live there?" => question is grammatical and easy to read
	    - Q2: "When you move there?" => question is fragmented and harder to parse; text_that_is_more_fluent=1
- Relevance
	- Example post: "I got offered a job on the border of South Dakota and Minnesota. From various real estate sites, it seems that similar houses are considerably cheaper in Minnesota. Are there any reasons I should not look at Minnesota as an option?"
	    - Q1: "Have you considered moving to North Dakota?" => question is unrelated to post
	    - Q2: "What is the resale value on homes in Minnesota?" => question is relevant and specific; text_that_is_more_relevant=2
- Likely to help post author rewrite post
	- Example post: "I got offered a job on the border of South Dakota and Minnesota. From various real estate sites, it seems that similar houses are considerably cheaper in Minnesota. Are there any reasons I should not look at Minnesota as an option?"
	    - Q1: "Where are you moving from?" => question will encourage author to provide more context that could help decide whether to recommend one location over another
	    - Q2: "Are you seriously considering South Dakota?" => question is rhetorical and less likely to yield new information from author; text_that_is_more_likely_helpful=1

2. Read each post ("post") and the questions that were written in response to the posts ("question_1" and "question_2") in reader_group_ground_truth_data.tsv. Each of the questions was written by an author from a different reader group: e.g. "question_1" was written by a "non-expert" reader while "question_2" was written by an "expert" reader. You should select the reader group that you believe matches the author of "question_1", e.g. if you believe that "question_1" was written by an expert, write "expert" in the blank.
- Expert vs. non-expert
	- Example post: "I currently have about 3k in the bank and just got my first real job out of college, in NY state. It pays about 70k/year. Im looking at purchasing my first car to commute there (a 2018 mazda 6). Should I buy it?"
	    - Q1: "What is the car's average mileage?" => question asks about specific detail of car, which requires background knowledge about how cars work
	    - Q2: "Roughly how much does the car cost?" => question addresses simple aspect of car ownership, probably written by non-expert; question_1_group_label="expert"
- Fast vs. slow response
	- Example post: "I currently have about 3k in the bank and just got my first real job out of college, in NY state. It pays about 70k/year. Im looking at purchasing my first car to commute there (a 2018 mazda 6). Should I buy it?"
		- Q1: "How often do you plan to drive the car outside of commuting to work?" => question considers complex/long-term aspects of car ownership, likely written more slowly; 
		- Q2: "Is the 2018 model better than other models?" => question addresses basic information from post, probably written quickly; question_1_group_label="slow"
- US vs. non-US reader
	- Example post: "I currently have about 3k in the bank and just got my first real job out of college, in NY state. It pays about 70k/year. Im looking at purchasing my first car to commute there (a 2018 mazda 6). Should I buy it?"
		- Q1: "Does your workplace have parking available for your car?" => non-US readers may not know that many work places in US provide parking
		- Q2: "How much would it cost to lease the car?" => US readers are likely familiar with lease payment plans; question_1_group_label="non-US"
