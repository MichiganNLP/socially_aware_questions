7py853	legaladvice	"Turning to the experts at reddit!  I'm in a battle (and losing) with Cap One. Had their credit card for over 8 years.  They recently flagged my account for fraud (although there were no fraudulent charges).  To clear the account they want copies of Nevada DL and SS card emailed to confirm my identity. I am not comfortable sending a credit card company hard copies of my SS card.  So I sent my DL and redacted the number.  They would not accept stating needing front AND back and number of DL.  Next I emailed them a copy of my Passport, copy of DL with numbers redacted, and a copy of my SS card with first five numbers redacted.  They would not accept. Next I had an ""Affidavit of Identity"" notarized which included the numbers for my Passport, DL, and SS card.  I mailed (snail mail) the original to Cap One.  They would not accept.  When I asked why they would not accept a legal notarized document, the manager's response was ""we have the right to ask for SS card due to the Patriot Act"" and ""anyone can become a notary"".  After all this I requested to close the account.  They will not close the account without a copy of my Soc Sec Card.  The Fraud Dept manager informed me the account would remain in ""suspended"" state indefinitely.  Furthermore I would be responsible for paying the yearly account fees of $39 even though I cannot use the account....or close it. In addition, they also have $95 in cash back rewards that is also ""suspended"".Last week on 1/4 I paid the remaining balance in full.  However, two days ago they charged the yearly fee of $39. I do not understand why a credit card company needs to have hard copies of my Driver's License and Social Security card on their servers.  They have me by the short hairs.  Any help/advise greatly appreciated!!"	LOC	I would not give them your physical card but why won't you email them a copy of your SSN card?

814t9v	personalfinance	My wife, over a year ago, thought she submitted three paystubs to qualify for deferment for a year. We currently work overseas, and never received an email or phone call about her loans that she hadn't ever actually done that. Incredibly stupid of us not to double check that everything was OK, but here we are. The first message we received (sent to her mother, which we have listed as our physical address in the US) was that her loans had been sent to a collections agency. Her loans are about 22k. Is there anything that we can do to properly get her loans deferred, or is it too late at this point and we just have to deal with a collections agency? 	LOC	Are these all federal?	Is she in school?

8m1fzh	personalfinance	My small business recently went under the water unfortunately and I am currently working on liquidating all remaining assets.However, due to the US tax system I'm still expected to pay 2 payments of quarterly taxes on profit that I will most likely never earn. (I have enough cash to pay for the one due on June 15). I can technically afford to pay them, but that would require the further selling of various stocks I've invested in for the long term, which would incur capital gains tax.I'm wondering if there is anything I can do, like reach out to the IRS and explain my situation. I do have a CPA but she charges 250/hour so I thought I'd ask here first, thank you for any help you can offer.	EXPERT	What kind of tax payment?	What does that mean?	expert vs. novice	-1

8meh2y	legaladvice	A little background: several months before filing divorce I moved a couple hours away from my stbxh. Due to financial issues we opted to use the same lawyer and split the cost. My divorce was to be final this week. I called the courthouse to make sure they have my correct address on file to send the final paperwork. Surprise! They don’t have the paperwork. The lawyers office never filed the second notice. The paperwork I signed three months ago.  I called the office and the paralegal told me that they have 90 days to file the paperwork and the court will backdate the paperwork to when I signed. Is this correct? Or will I have to wait another 90 days for this divorce to be final? The clerk in the county prothonotary’s office couldn’t tell me.

8oi6pf	legaladvice	Title says it all, my parents have taken out $15,000 in debt in my name that I never authorized and they explicitly told me didn’t exist. Is this criminal or civil? Where do I start to get this money back? It’s spread across several loans, all handled online, using usernames and passwords they stole from me. Also, how enforceable are oral contracts in RI?

8p4uwz	Advice	Was in the midst of a panic attack over some terrible news I had received and accidentally bumped the front of a parked car trying to street park. Left a smallish dent.

The title is a bit hyperbolic but I'm really at the end of my rope. I'm 24 and feel like I'm trapped in my home. Here's kinda how things went:I was a pretty stellar student until about my sophomore year of highschool. My sophomore year, my parents decided to get into daily yelling matches. Call me a pussy, I'm fine with that, but this absolutely was not the norm for 99% of my life up to that point. It shook me up big time.Starting my sophomore year, my grades began to plummet. I was terrified at school worrying about what I might come home to. I thought about trying to get my license and trying to find a job just to be out of the house as well as having spending cash. My dad would kinda do the whole ""Oh well it can wait."" Blah blah blah. Fine. Whatever. I had ALWAYS planned on taking a break after highschool. I needed it. So after my grades plummeted, I was able to get my ass in gear to focus on schooling again. I graduated and was pretty happy. But the stresses of my parents fighting constantly for 3 years was just too much.To make things worse, my mom had to quit her job because she lost a leg to a random blood clot.Well of course, my dad started hammering me on getting a job. The issue is that he owns a furniture repair business. He REALLY wanted to force me to work for him. For free. The idea being that he feeds me and houses me and all that. I get it. But I dunno it felt a bit ridiculous. He used to HIRE someone else to do all of that. These are things I'm fairly certain you can pass off onto customers OR the new opening in work load can allow you to take on more business I would think. Of course, I didn't look too far into it so I could be way off. It seems like, now, he's constantly gating me off of improving myself. I want to get a job, get a license and improve myself. But every time I bring it up, my dad gates it behind the idea of like ""Why work for someone else when you can work for me and take over the business?"" or ""As soon as you get a job I'm gonna expect you to start paying rent and stuff."" It's not that I think the paying rent is unreasonable but if that's the case, I'd rather just have my own place. It'd prevent drama and arguments over things. I don't use tv in my house for example so paying for cable would be a waste of money.I thought about doing Job Corps but I'm not totally convinced it's the best route for me yet. I still have several months to decide on that anyways if I've exhausted all other options. I feel like my biggest struggle in life is finding the route to get started.

Not so much from a moral standpoint, but more in terms of how little PTO I have, and how difficult it is to use. At this point, if I use any more after my interview next week (for which I took half a day, called it a doctors appt.) I'll go into debt with the company for time. If iI do end up taking a new job, I'll have to pay that back when I leave if I haven't accrued it yet. That's not a huge deal for a few hours, but if I'm interviewing with 3-5 companies, I can see a lot of time going into it. Is there a good way to convince hiring managers to do phone or after-hour interviews? It's relay my only shot at casting a wide net. For reference, I'm in IT, 24, mid-level experience (7 years), and looking for a NOC/Systems engineering/technician role. I understand I won't get an offer through phone interviews alone, but I'd like to be able to at least cut down on the time as most of these will have multiple interviews per position.

8tb0np	legaladvice	[This was my initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8t5yko/21_year_old_with_upcoming_hearing_for_restraining/)It’s not appearing to be very likely that I’ll be able to afford a lawyer in time for the hearing, but I don’t want to just not show up because I know I’m innocent &amp; I won’t be able to make it a whole year without my son. Are there any more affordable alternatives? I live in smalltown South Dakota so lawyers are very limited &amp; they all want basically the same amount, $1200 give or take a hundred. Between tuition, bills, etc I can’t scrap up the money by mid July. Do I have ANY chance at fighting a restraining order by myself, versus her, her family, &amp; her lawyer? Like I said in my first post, I can’t really present anything to prove that I’m not psychotic or worthy of a restraining order. At the same time, her evidence is pretty weak, sighting just a few of the text messages when we’d argue &amp; some of my consecutive phone calls when she’d leave with the baby unannounced.Is it likely for the judge to actually hear me out, or will I basically be dismissed automatically when I show up without a lawyer. This is my first time in court so I’m not familiar with much of anything. Anything helps. Thanks.	EXPERT	How much is your child worth to you?

8u2s3l	personalfinance	A bit of background about me. I’m a 25 years old System Administrator mainly working with Linux but also have some experience working with other UNIX systems. I have 2 years of experience as a sysadmin and before that I used to work as a developer. I honestly don’t know how long I have been coding, I started coding in university but my degree is in unrelated field. I probably have been coding since 2011 or 2012. So few months ago my company accidentally leaked document which implies that they are planning to close branch I’m working at. They have been closing smaller branches for past year or so. A third (!!!) of people already have gotten notices and either have been fired or will be fired until end of the year. I’m safe for next 6 months or so… Needless to say I have been looking for a new job for a while now. First I even tried to write down every company I’ve applied to in a spreadsheet but I gave up on it. At this point I have applied for over 100 positions. I have tailored both my CV and my CL for those positions. What frustrated me is that a lot of them have unrealistic requirements, like 5+ years of experience with dozens of technologies for a JUNIOR position. Of course for a junior salary. What’s more I’m feeling betrayed in my current job. A while ago I realized that my company doesn’t give a flying fuck about employees. Most of my peers make more than I do, even juniors make more. One of my managers admitted (when we were out drinking) that I don’t make more because of my lack of social skills... Well, that's how his manager justified not increasing my salary. Right now it seems like company is wanting for us to quite. All overtime has to be pre-approved by someone waaaaay up in management chain. Due to ‘budget reasons” and they have implied that we should not expect any salary increased anytime soon.   At this point I just like a complete failure. At first I even tried to write down all positions I was applying for and how long it took them to respond. I gave up after first 50 or so...   TL;DR: I guess I just wanted to rant…	EXPERT	Are there specific skills you could develop that are in demand?	Are we talking History or Philosophy?	expert vs. novice	-1

8uajem	pcmasterrace	Hello, I was curious as to what kind of stuff is in my pre-built, so I opened my computer. I checked the PSU, GPU, and cooler. Then I couldn't see the text that was on the RAM stick, so I spent 5 minutes trying to remove it. I looked at it, and put it back. I then powered the pc on, and heard beeping tune. I turned the pc off, unplugged it, opened it up, and checked the ram. It was in the wrong way. I quickly corrected that, plugged my pc in, and turned it on. Everything works except my monitor.

8vbsaa	legaladvice	This happened in Boston. My friends and I (4 women) were coming back from the bar at closing time. One of us was being kind of loud and obnoxious, but the rest of us were fine. While on the trip, I noticed that there was a display screen next to the rear view mirror showing both what was happening in front of the car and the passengers inside. I told the driver that this made me extremely uncomfortable. He claimed that it was legal because 1) he had posted signs and 2) it didn't record audio. There was a sign he had made on the side window next to us about no smoking, eating etc. that included a notice about audio and video recording in progress. But I  hadn't noticed it and it was hard to read at night. I told him I was a law student (not in MA) and that it made me very uncomfortable. He claimed it was for his own protection. The rest of the ride was basically an argument and at the end he told us to get the fuck out of his car. Am I right, that his camera is illegal? I don't like being recorded by strange men like that.

8x033j	pcmasterrace	I recently added 2x8 GB of RAM to my setup, which already had 2x4 GB. Instead of selling my old 8GB I decided to use them both creating a total of 24GB. I'm not sure if this was the right choice or not. I've been told in the past that problems may arise if all the RAM sticks aren't the exact same size and make.

8xz8hi	Advice	Is it weird for a guy to lose virginity at late 23? Also, is it weird that I only had one girlfriend until now, and dated (for a few months each) about 3 other girls? I did feel pretty bad about it, and my current girlfriend (who I lost my virginity to) makes it pretty hard. If I try to make her feel special and loved, she just tells me that I’m saying/doing those things because she’s my first one. It’s so frustrating because I love her, but I can’t seem to make her feel special, whatever I do. Also, she often snaps and makes me feel like a weirdo because of this, like I missed out on stuff and like I could never make her feel like her previous boyfriends did, just because of this.I’m trying so hard here, but I can never rise up to those standards, because I can’t change my past.

8yb80r	Advice	Over the last 18 months my life has somewhat imploded. Our dog (only 2 years old) had a series of unforeseen medical problems that have resulted in a lot of stress. Currently he’s being kept alive by a load of medication, a state that I don’t agree with but my mother refuses to put him down as to her ‘a life is a life’. But seeing him in the constant lethargic state instead of the energetic puppy I knew is desperately sad to me and it’s something beyond my control.I had a 6 year relationship that ended 5 months ago as I discovered my boyfriend had started another relationship behind my back, and eventually when confronted he chose her over me. To go from a promise of moving in together and an imminent engagement to having the life I thought I would have being ripped away is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. I’m getting better, but the pain does still rear its head.The most stressful thing however, is my father. He is extremely mentally unwell with what consultants believe is paranoid schizophrenia, however he refuses to accept any treatment. He has been kicked out of the home as he has become aggressive and erratic, and that behaviour has become directed at us. We have been placed on a police victim list (meaning we have a dedicated worker as they feel there is a real threat of harm), and my father has taken to stalking myself and other members of the family and sending threats of physical harm to us or himself. This often happens in the middle of the night and the constant looking over my shoulder and worry for him as a human being means that I’ve fallen into a deep state of anxiety. We’re working with the police to hopefully get him arrested and assessed with the ultimate aim for him to be committed in a mental institution for treatment even if it is against his will. There's just a lot of bureaucracy involved so the process is slow.The culmination of these things have spun me into terrible anxiety and near depression. My sleep habits have become poor and I’ve lost a ton of weight due to the stress. I look terrible and often I feel like I’m present in life but not ‘really there’. Unsurprisingly this has bled over into my work life.I go in and perform my duties, I think it peaks and troughs on whether I’m having a good day or a bad day, but I know my performance has been patchy. The main issue though is that my work places emphasis on joining in with ‘office culture’ and being friendly to everyone, apart from a guy my own age who knows about my problems, I’m not particularly friendly with any of them. I’m nice of course, but when they’re laughing and joking with each other I feel like I’m outside looking in as I can’t bring myself to ‘snap out of my funk’ so to speak. It's like I'm watching these happy interactions but my own mind is fogged and I can't think of what to say even if I wanted to join the conversation. I’ve heard in bits and pieces that my boss isn’t too keen on me for this reason, and I can tell that along with some others she doesn’t particularly care for me at all. I will say that the people I am friendlier with seem quite fond of me, but those who I’m disconnected from seem to have little positive feelings towards me. I know this is my own fault for letting my situation get the best of me and I deeply regret that this is the situation and it does make me uncomfortable knowing that people don't particularly like me.My appraisal is coming up in two weeks and at the bottom there is the obligatory box for ‘is there anything else you’d like to discuss’. I’m debating whether to request a brief conversation regarding my personal circumstances to assuage the feelings around it and give them confidence that I’ll make steps to try harder in future. But I know there seems to be a stigma around divulging this type of information at work, so I’m unsure. Is this something that I should bring up do you think, even if it’s just to acknowledge it? I know my boss and others are aware of bits and pieces, but I don’t think they know how deeply it has affected me or how serious it is. Things are finally starting to look up and I’m feeling happier than I’ve been in a long time but I feel stuck in this awkward rut I've created for myself. I’d very much like to be part of the office culture as we are a small team of about 20 people, but I’m wondering if it’s too late to explain and try again. Especially where these situations have been going on for a long time it might be a case of there’s no point in mentioning it as people are too set in their opinions. I’m not in danger of losing my job, but just to increase my happiness at work I’m wondering if it’s a good idea? Would my boss sympathise and understand me a little better? And what could I even say that would remain appropriate for a work environment even if it is a very casual one?	EXPERT	My next thought was, what do I hope to achieve by talking to him?

8zog29	personalfinance	Throwaway because I don't like to let most folks know about my financial situation.As the title says, I'm 25 years old, and inherited a large sum from my grandfather when he passed away. He passed when I was around 9 years old, and to my understanding, the account was somewhere in the $500k range at the time. By the time I gained control of it, it was just over $700k. Since then, I've used this to pay for two years of community college, a surgery, a reliable car, and a 20% down payment on a modest house. I've also been living off of it, almost entirely. The only other income I make is on my own attempt at starting a small business, which, in all honesty, only makes me a couple hundred bucks a month. The money has been in an Edward Jones stock account for years, and I left it there when I gained control of it. To my understanding, they have it in some sort of diverse stock portfolio, where they automatically move things around based on the level of risk I decide on each year. It's at a low-moderate risk right now. I have about $105k in a single account, and about $310k in an IRA. Thing is, I know... nothing about money. My parents never taught me anything about finances, even knowing what I was sitting on for 15 years, and I guess I just never knew where to start in learning. I know that's almost entirely my fault, but now I just have no idea where to start. I feel embarrassed asking my Edward Jones rep, because I've been sort of trying to pretend I know what he's talking about for four years. He seems like a good financial advisor and he seems to have the best interest in mind for my money (probably because the more I make, the more he makes), but I've just been blindly trusting that he's doing the right thing for years.The money has been sitting steady at $415k since I purchased my home, which was in November of last year. I take out $2,500 per month for living costs, and the accounts gain enough that it stays even. However, I know this money has the potential to gain a lot more, but I feel clueless on how to make better use of it. I don't want to end up slowly dwindling it down to nothing before I'm even 40.

He doesn't want to take out a loan in case he gets sick and can't work to pay for it. Mind you he has worked all these years and in the process lost 1 home to bankruptcy another home to foreclosure and doesn't own the property his business sits in cause he took a loan against it. But has a lifetime stay. Second option he doesn't want to sell what our brother worked for all his life. Ok I get that. He's being greedy.

92xilj	personalfinance	My wife and I have done the math, and it makes the most sense for us to buy. Problem is, we're in a very active and expensive housing market that has us intimidated about buying. Think $450k for a 3br 2 ba, 1650sq ft with a yard (and that's a steal). Our main question is how much house we can afford.On my end, I feel like the 28% of income for housing rule is too conservative for us, as we have no other debts and high potential to earn more in the future. My wife is more risk-averse, and I understand, especially since it feels like our area's housing prices are overinflated.

92xilj	personalfinance	My wife and I have done the math, and it makes the most sense for us to buy. Problem is, we're in a very active and expensive housing market that has us intimidated about buying. Think $450k for a 3br 2 ba, 1650sq ft with a yard (and that's a steal). Our main question is how much house we can afford.On my end, I feel like the 28% of income for housing rule is too conservative for us, as we have no other debts and high potential to earn more in the future. My wife is more risk-averse, and I understand, especially since it feels like our area's housing prices are overinflated.

93gycl	legaladvice	I am currently enrolled in a summer class at a small state school here in the state of Kansas. It's a sociology course, and we had a class earlier this week that was in regards to hate speech. We frequently have similar conversations where students are able to express their opinions on different topics and in many cases these topics are relevant political issues in today's news. Usually I am quiet, but as a supporter of freedom of speech I was pretty attentive to this one, because it was about racism and hate speech. A student got up and basically it should be against the law to say words like the N word and other things if you aren't apart of that race. After that I then said my opinion which was essentially being a free speech absolutist. We had a back and forth completely non threatening in any way and I didn't raise my voice at all or make any movements or anything. Eventually I started asking what words were and weren't okay. This was in an attempt to show how ridiculous this could be. I said and used examples and said them these words were Honky, Coon, Wet Back, Bitch, Chink, Uncle Tom just to name a few although I don't know how many others I used (Not many). That was pretty much the end of the discussion some people were clearly uncomfortable, but I honestly didn't care. I didn't use any of these words to refer to other students, or in a demeaning way. I was just asking about what words were okay and what ones weren't. This was yesterday morning when this class took place. I am supposed to have class again tomorrow, however I got an email from my instructor saying she had gotten contacted by a number of students who said they were uncomfortable with the language I used, and she doesn't think I should attend class anymore. She also stated that she had set up a meeting with me, her, and her boss (I believe the dean) about how to move forward from here. She told me she could kick me out of class if that was necessary. This class is just about over. The final is next week. I think this is unfair, and I would argue illegal. I plan on attending class tomorrow, and I've called my boss to tell her I will be late because of the meeting. If they continue with the threats of kicking me out of the class should I call a lawyer?  Should I try to get one to be present at this meeting? Should I at least record this meeting?

95u09v	personalfinance	"Hey all, I'm a 19 yo who just started his swim into the great world of adulting and I want to swim out to the open waters and settle down in another reef, so to speak.A bit of backgound info about me:My credit history runs for just over a year now, with a total of 5 accounts (4 credit cards, 2 of which are retail, and a Self Lender credit builder account). My current scores hover around the 720-730 range. I follow religiously by the 30% rule, and I don't have any derogatory accounts, no major debts nor am I in danger of going into collections. I also have a total revolving credit limit of $7,000 (split 50/50 between the two retail cards and my two general cards). The self lender account is a $545 loan locked in a CD until 11 months from now.My family came from the Philippines and I am a first generation child here in America. Because of this, I don't have the sort of $10k lying around from Mom's investments accounts or whatever the story may be. We manage to get by with a little wiggle room for luxuries. That being said, communication with my parents isn't the best, which will come to play later.As of right now, I'm currently working a retail job, with a annual gross pay of roughly $19k, given my current wage and average hours. I have just under $2,000 stashed away in savings. I recently started investing with Stash, but I don't expect to see any huge gains until I'm in my early mid 30s and I've got actual money to invest and not get mere penny returns. Currently, I have regular monthly payments of roughly $210, for my phone bill, public transport and the self lender account.So here's my situation:I want to move to an entirely different state. I'm currently in Hawaii, looking for an apartment and roommates in the SF Bay area or an outlying city, with the plan to have a lease signed and have at least one roommate by the end of the year. I want to move for both personal reasons, and for career/school reasons. I currently am not in school, and I don't plan on returning until I settle in (or have my dreams of moving completely shut down), so I have time to focus on getting me the sweet cash money. I have thought about just dorming for the moment while I plan out a more permanent move plan, but I don't want the burden of student loans bringing me down in the future.Because I'm a first generation American, there's quite a bit of culture differences between how my mom and I see things, and communication is shaky a lot of times (I live with my mom and step father, both from the Philippines, and my step father is an ass so he won't be involved). I have expressed this need to fly out of the nest; both to grow as a person, and in pursuit of a potential career. But due to the general lack of funds and shaky communication, I don't expect much financial help from my mom. Though she is willing to help, she won't be able to contribute much in the way of finance, nor is she a source of guidance for me (sorry mom! Love you, but your comments of ""how come you wanna move"" and ""don't you know it's expensive"" without really... guiding me isn't going to help).

9d03up	personalfinance	Hi everyone - I'm 50 years old and have about half a mill in my retirement savings with probably another 8k in other retirement accounts.  I have another 10k in my HSA and 22k in a bank savings account.  SSA.gov predicts I'll get 1500 or so monthly, and I might inherit some money as well.  These are my only assets - I have no house and my car is worth a few thousand at best.  I have zero debt.  I worked as a registered nurse for 25 years and left due to burnout.  Originally I was going to take a year off but it's going on two.  I am working as a package handler which takes care of the few expenses I have (I live with my elderly parents) and provides excellent health insurance, but of course I haven't put anything in my retirement since I started.  I probably will go back to nursing eventually but it will be on a part-time basis, both to take care of my parents and because being a nurse is very difficult.  Am I on track for retirement even if never put another dime in?  I live very frugally but I don't want to be a burden to my daughter.  Also, what should I do with my 22k?  I know it's dumb to keep it in a savings account, but I want to keep it liquid.	EXPERT	Is the 500k pre or post tax savings?	SS of $1500 at what age?	expert vs. novice	-1

9gzh87	personalfinance	Long story short, I work in a cozy office for a University. I am on a team managed by one woman. Last week I made a couple mistakes in my work and things weren't really going my way. I noticed that my boss started to act passive-aggressively towards me: Not saying hello in the morning or making eye contact when I try to talk to her, trying to do my work ahead of me having a chance to get to it, piling on work asking “Where do things stand with this” and adding short turn-around deadlines—basically setting me up for failure. After a couple days, I had enough. Late into an afternoon I walked into her office and asked if I could speak to her. I came off entirely unaggressive and said something to the effect of “I’m not really happy with the way things have been going and it’s making me a bit upset. I don’t think I’ve been quite as effective as a could be, and I would like your help to improve” to which she says something to the effect of “I agree you haven’t been doing well” and nothing more.  She let the conversation die and I stared at her, eventually saying “well I hope I can find a way to improve” and I walk out.This week I had hoped her attitude would be a bit better but she is no different. She continues to ignore me while socializing with other team members. Today, we all had planned 1:1 meetings with her. She ran a bit late on the first one then had the second one. I was suppose to be third in line at 3:00pm. The 2nd meeting got out a little late so I sent her an instant message “if you are tired and would like to reschedule for tomorrow, that is okay with me”. She didn’t respond, and instead hosted the final 4th meeting. She then rescheduled my meeting until tomorrow.Now I am a bit annoyed. I have a cool and calm composure and I can handle a little tension—that’s fine but this is just petty. She is blantly going out of her way to passively toy with me and is ignoring me from a professional standpoint. I am still a solid performer, I know I am. I churn work all day and I try my hardest but she continues to act like this. I’ve considered bringing this to the manager above her, but this honestly does not bother me enough yet. I am not annoyed from a personal perspective but professional. How should I handle this situation? 	TIME	Do you not have an HR dept?	How bad was your work?	fast response vs. slow response	-1
9gzh87	personalfinance	Long story short, I work in a cozy office for a University. I am on a team managed by one woman. Last week I made a couple mistakes in my work and things weren't really going my way. I noticed that my boss started to act passive-aggressively towards me: Not saying hello in the morning or making eye contact when I try to talk to her, trying to do my work ahead of me having a chance to get to it, piling on work asking “Where do things stand with this” and adding short turn-around deadlines—basically setting me up for failure. After a couple days, I had enough. Late into an afternoon I walked into her office and asked if I could speak to her. I came off entirely unaggressive and said something to the effect of “I’m not really happy with the way things have been going and it’s making me a bit upset. I don’t think I’ve been quite as effective as a could be, and I would like your help to improve” to which she says something to the effect of “I agree you haven’t been doing well” and nothing more.  She let the conversation die and I stared at her, eventually saying “well I hope I can find a way to improve” and I walk out.This week I had hoped her attitude would be a bit better but she is no different. She continues to ignore me while socializing with other team members. Today, we all had planned 1:1 meetings with her. She ran a bit late on the first one then had the second one.

9hton6	Advice	As the title says, I have a girlfriend. Will be 5 years soon. I really do love her. We live together. I know her family well, we have been through everything together. Unfortunately, it includes her slipping up and kissing another guy that she met for drinks. &amp;#x200B;It was 6 months ago. She told me how she was feeling neglected by me (which is fair, to her credit) and was lonely. Another guy reached out to just hang out and have a drink or two. They ended up kissing. She left immediately and on my request, has cut contact. She told me the next day, told me everything I wanted to know. And I believe in forgiveness and that everybody does make mistakes. And that does not make them a bad person.&amp;#x200B;But i really am struggling. I have been everyday for 6 months. I am the kind of person who does take something like this very personally and it eats me alive that someone who I have given that much of my life to would kiss another guy. And I know its just a kiss and it's not a big deal. I'm the guy that she relies on, that she lives with, that she kisses everyday and that she loves. But the thought of her being committed to me and still kissing another guy kills me.&amp;#x200B;IDK if anybody can relate to this, or has ever had something similar in their life, but i'm hoping that time heals.

9j2dn5	personalfinance	"23, poor af, community college, send help&amp;#x200B;So I recently got a job at Lockheed Martin. They want me to finish my electrical engineering degree before putting me on any client jobs, which is more than understandable, so I dont really have any income from them. The problem is that school has left me \~$14,000 in debt, normally this wouldnt be an issue because of student loans, but my bank (and all I've looked into) dont offer student loans for students attending 2 year colleges. Here's the *real* problem: My first account of borrowing for school was when I went to a program through my community college at PSU for a nanotechnology degree. Here I borrowed \~$6,000. My banker told me to put it on my credit card (I know, red flag) so that I could come in at a later time and not borrow more than I need; A big fuck no went off in my head, but I'd been banking with him through my adolescence - present and didn't think he would do me wrong, also my dad went to the bank with me and he wasn't really phased.After placing that and my next semester on my credit card I went in to transfer my debt to a loan. Well, even after having an appropriate income, a good credit score (\~750) and working with them for the entirety of my life, they denied me a personal loan due to ""not enough credit history"". At this point my banker that I trusted gave me some sketchy af options, so I dont think I'll be working with him again. So basically I need a way to keep my head above water until I start working on client jobs in a year. I'm working part time to pay bills, but my finances are staying stagnant. I dont care if I rack up $100,000 in debt, I just really need help getting it off my cc.

9jelvh	personalfinance	Hi, longtime lurker, though I seldom post. I recently interviewed for a job at a company that is a closer commute to my home than my current position, and I would end up making substantially more money. As this is my first job after getting a couple years of experience on my resume. However I have an acquaintance who held this position in 2013, at the time he would’ve had a year less experience than I do now when he was hired in. As his base pay he received  $72,000, in my offer letter they are offering me 60,000. Are they lowballing me because it is expected that in this day and age people negotiate a higher wage? I mean on the one hand I’d be making way more than I am now, so am I crazy to even be complaining about it. But if I settle for a lower start pay it would be years before I even reach the other amount let alone even higher. I guess I’m just nervous about trying to bargain for better pay and get the offer rescinded. And even though it’s a closer commute I’d still be commuting an hour and that adds up over time, could I include that as a reason for negotiating a better pay? I guess I am looking for people opinions on the matter and the best way to come off professionally when negotiating, as I’ve never done it before. Any help is appreciated!Ps. Glassdoor does not have a salary listed for this position for this company, but paysa does, but I’ve never heard of that site so I wasn’t sure how reliable it was. But paysa says that $58,000 is the 25%, whereas $72,000 is the average.	TIME	Or plain made it up?	will that happen every time?	fast response vs. slow response	-1

9jr1fh	personalfinance	Hello, I’m a 19 year old guy that’s getting ripped to shred by my car and auto insurance. A few months ago I was Active Duty, making roughly $1900 a month and driving a beater. One day I was sitting at a red light and my beater decided to catch on fire, not joking. I really could not go without a car and I had just enough to make a down payment. I walked into the nearest dealership got a 13,000 Loan and drove off with a used 2016 Dodge Dart SXT. My monthly minimum payment is $247.00 at a 10% rate, it was the best I could find with no credit history on the insurance side I was looking at $184.27 for monthly full coverage insurance with a clean record. Fast forward to now I have been medically discharged from the military, starting school Oct 23, working 15 hours a week, making roughly $200 every two weeks  and I just found out today my insurance is doubling due to the state I live in. Now I am looking at my $247.00 car payment as well as my newly discovered $360 insurance bill. I have looked at other insurance companies and this is the best I can get, crazy to think that.I have absolutely no clue what to do, my classes start October 23rd and are 7:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. and I will work 5:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. I currently work three nights a week and that will increase to five nights a week through the holidays but still only nets me $528 every two weeks. That is as far as I have gotten in trying to crunch numbers, any help or advice I can get is greatly appreciated.	TIME	Do you have any savings at all for a beater car?

9ohp1z	legaladvice	OK here is the long and the short of it. I was dating my former partner for 10 years up until this fall when our relationship went south. 3 years prior, we had purchased a to-be-built home in a new suburb. When we bought the home the money came from 3 sources mine, his, and his Aunts. His aunt was willing to help us out and was looking to invest some extra cash. The cost was split 3 ways divided like this mine=1/4, His=1/4, His Aunt= 1/2. All costs were split this way, except living costs (heat hydro ex.) those were split between me and my partner alone. Now we are selling the home but I’m facing one big issue, I don’t have any legal document saying I’m part owner of this home. I fear that if things turn more hostile between the ex and myself (fyi I’m not in any physical danger and I’m 100% safe) I might not have any legal right to part of the sale of this home. That cannot happen; I need this money for my own future. So my question is can someone point me in the right direction in terms of legal advice? Like what kind of lawyer would I need to talk to make sure I get what is mine? Edit: their names are on the deed.Any information would be super helpful.We live in Ontario Canada.

9ozhqy	personalfinance	So this past week, my fiancee and I found a vehicle we though we would like to purchase for around $23,000 sticker price, and we were aiming to negotiate to around $20,000. The car was used, but only 11,000 miles, and was 6 years old. Research of the vehicle put its fair price at around 19 - 20 thousand. Combined we have enough income to easily cover the price of the auto loan if we financed for 72 Months at around a 5%-6% APR, with $1000 down. I know that we both have very good credit, anywhere from 750 upwards for both of us, however, its is not extensively established. My longest line of credit has been open for about 5 years, but is not continuously used, and my other lines are around the 2-3 year range, also not continuously used. Hers were even less. We have no current mortgages or other liabilities. I know my first mistake was relying on the dealer to work through financing for us, but when they ran our credit reports they expected us to take on a loan at 15% APR! Being a finance major getting ready to graduate, I knew this was absolutely ridiculous for an automobile loan, and was never going to accept a 15% APR, no matter what monthly payments were. I expected a much more reasonable rate seeing as I have excellent credit standing, even without 10 years or more of establishment.So I guess my question to all of you who have gone this before, how were you able to finance your automobile purchases? Does extensive established credit matter that much for an automobile loan? Why did our situation end up this way when we were trying to work out a deal?Thanks All!

9ozhqy	personalfinance	So this past week, my fiancee and I found a vehicle we though we would like to purchase for around $23,000 sticker price, and we were aiming to negotiate to around $20,000. The car was used, but only 11,000 miles, and was 6 years old. Research of the vehicle put its fair price at around 19 - 20 thousand. Combined we have enough income to easily cover the price of the auto loan if we financed for 72 Months at around a 5%-6% APR, with $1000 down. I know that we both have very good credit, anywhere from 750 upwards for both of us, however, its is not extensively established. My longest line of credit has been open for about 5 years, but is not continuously used, and my other lines are around the 2-3 year range, also not continuously used. Hers were even less. We have no current mortgages or other liabilities. I know my first mistake was relying on the dealer to work through financing for us, but when they ran our credit reports they expected us to take on a loan at 15% APR! Being a finance major getting ready to graduate, I knew this was absolutely ridiculous for an automobile loan, and was never going to accept a 15% APR, no matter what monthly payments were. I expected a much more reasonable rate seeing as I have excellent credit standing, even without 10 years or more of establishment.So I guess my question to all of you who have gone this before, how were you able to finance your automobile purchases? Does extensive established credit matter that much for an automobile loan? Why did our situation end up this way when we were trying to work out a deal?Thanks All!

9w2cdf	AmItheAsshole	I (28M) was in a relationship with a girl (27F)  in my medical school since the last 5 years.  We both loved each other and thought we had a future together.  It was my first serious relationship and I gave it everything I had.  Now coming to the physical part of the relationship.  I was a virgin when I met her, and after 5 years I'm still one.  I understood she didn't want to have sex during the initial days but I gradually grew more frustrated.  We made out a few times but even then I felt like I was forcing her.  She's totally against premarital sex and although I was accomodating at first,  my resentment grew.  My behavior started changing and she broke up witb me.  She thinks I was with her only for sex.

9wez0l	legaladvice	My grandfather built a cabin in northern Arizona in the 60's. As a child in the 90's it was my favorite place in the world. To this day it is the single  most nostalgic place on earth for myself and my two brothers (and is very likely the sole piece of inheritance we will ever get from my family). In 2012 the cabin was getting to be too much of a burden on my (then 84 year old) grandmother. She deeded the cabin over to my aunt (who was the one taking care of the property at the time) and her husband. My grandmother has told me several times over the years that she did so on the condition that my aunt put myself and my two brothers (the only grandchildren she has) as heirs in her (my aunt's) will.Sadly my aunt passed away last year. Her husband (who originally was married to her sister until they ran away together) says he never heard anything about passing the cabin to us and suspiciously can't find any will. My grandmother (now 90) calls him and tells him that the cabin is for her grandchildren. He basically tells her to F-off and is now selling the cabin fully intent on keeping all the money to himself.Is there anything I can do to fight this legally?

9wglur	pcmasterrace	So I'm a 22 yo woman who grew up with a gaming brother and we used to stay up late to play Wow, counter strike, hitman etc. So much fun. At that time getting a pc wasn't expensive and you didn't need to splash out a lot of cash to play the latest games.So, years have passed since I gamed on a pc. I have a PS4 but I was looking into getting a gaming pc because I want to play some fps games and don't really enjoy them on a console. But just overall the gaming experience seem to be much better on a pc and I miss having a keyboard and a mouse.To my surprise, a decent gaming pc costs around 1500$ now a days. That's an awful lot of money for a student like me. On top of that, a good graphics card cost around 500-1000$. That just seems insane to me.

9wzuqo	personalfinance	My [24M] wife [23F] and I are just getting started with our careers, and we almost have all of our debt paid off. Our credit scores are great, and we could live off of my salary alone fine, but she will probably be making more than me starting in two years once she finishes law school and gets a job. We are both pretty risk averse, and I’ve always been leery of the way Americans buy a $400k house for a 30-year mortgage (pronounced “debt”) and then end up paying much more for that house over that time period. So, we have been talking about staying in our apartment for a couple years longer than originally planned and trying to buy a house... in cash. Even if not the whole thing, maybe putting like 60% down or more, and trying to have it paid off within four or five years. To me, it’s about cash flow and getting things paid off as quickly as possible so that if something were to happen to one of us (disability or illness, lose our job, etc), we wouldn’t be screwed and living in a bigger house than we can afford. I’m big on not having debt - it terrifies me.I told my friends about it and they thought it was a very dumb idea. They said I should put 20% down or so - however much is needed to get the lowest interest rates possible - and then invest the rest. They said I would get better returns through investing, and it hedges against the risk of your house burns down or property values plummet. I get that, but a) isn’t that what insurance is for, and b) the beauty of owning a house outright is that if the property values plummet and the economy tanks... we wouldn’t really care because we own that house. To me it still makes sense to try to buy a house in cash even if it isn’t the best “investment” decision.Thoughts?	TIME	Do you have tools/knowledge/skills to maintain it?

9yrk4g	legaladvice	Location: NJ, USAHi, everyone. I recently made a few orders online at this outerwear company because they were having some crazy deals. The company is well known and popular. I used the browser extension Honey, which automatically applies coupon codes to your cart. I ended up getting items at around 10% of the retail price. I took screenshots of my receipts after ordering online just in case. I was originally charged on my credit card the amount that the receipt showed, which was the amount I agreed to pay. A few days later, the items were confirmed and shipped. In that shipping email, however, the price was different from what the website had shown me and what my screenshots show. I had a few orders, and each order had a different price increase, so it doesn’t really make sense. One of my orders went from $7 to $20, and another went from $40 to $500. At first, my credit card still had the pending charges of the original price, but when I checked this morning, they had posted higher. What should I do here? If I call the company and argue that since I have screenshots of my orders clearly showing the lower prices, should I be reimbursed? Will screenshots hold up? Can I call the bank and dispute it?Tldr: bought items online for a great deal, took screenshots of receipts on website. Was shipped those items, but then charged more than what I agreed to pay.

a1rw81	personalfinance	Recently around September I purchased a fairly cheap used car.

a8ak9c	personalfinance	We've taken our daughter to a really well known gymnastics class starting when she was 5.  She started in the Kindergarten class there in the fall of 2017.  She's 6 now and moved up to their level 1 recreational class.  Its only an hour and a half, one time a week.  She loves it.  Its $100 a month.  She makes friends there, the coaches are great, she's learning a lot of self confidence and fitness, which are the primary reasons we wanted her there.  It was actually her idea to do gymnastics as opposed to Soccer or Dance or anything else that we showed her.  So, she's happy and the price and time commitment are reasonable.  &amp;#x200B;So, last night my wife and I were there watching out daughter and we started chatting with some other parents there.  Their daughters were 7 and 8.  One is on their competition team, the other is on the pre-competition team.  So, their time commitment is 2 weekdays of 3.5 hours, 4 hours on saturday and on top of that, they have to go to a dance school one night a week for the floor routine.  Time commitment aside, the one blurted out that its $3,000.  We're not sure if that is per quarter (which is what they bill, ours is $300/qtr), semi annual or annual.  We didn't wanna ask because our jaws were already on the floor.&amp;#x200B;Now, there is no guarantee that our daughter will even want to do that.  She might want to just stay on the recreational side and just have fun.  But holy shit!!!!!!  That cost is astronomical, as i'd lean that it is most likely per quarter.  My wife and I are on the Dave Ramsey 7 step plan.  We're working on paying off debt, which we're doing well with.  But even if we paid off our debt before this, we'd be on a diet of rice and beans.  &amp;#x200B;I wanted to ask some others here, parents, who the hell do you do this?  Are there any tips or tricks that i could learn to make this more manageable?  How would you even consider this if you have a second or third child, let alone a kid in daycare.

I hadn’t followed through on that and when I came home today I had a brand new credit card in my name. Apparently my mom opened it for me using my information. Unfortunately this isn’t a card I would have chosen and I was very upset that she did this without asking me. What are my options as far as closing the card are concerned (it is a discover card that I have not activated)? Will this damage my credit?

ab0ip9	personalfinance	**Some context:** (Sorry if this doesn't belong in this sub.) In October I stopped working in NY and sort of coasted off of my savings until this December. My boyfriend who lives in WI had the option to terminate his lease early and took it so that we could move in together. Right now I'm going to be working here for ~9.50/h full time starting in January. The main problem right now is housing. &amp;nbsp;The places we've applied to so far seem to dislike us because I just moved and am not working yet or because my last pay stubs were from October and I guess that raises some red flags (I honestly thought me finding a job so quickly and having a decent credit score would be enough to show that I'm a competent tenant/not a liability but I guess I'm wrong.) &amp;nbsp;My boyfriend used his savings for his termination fee + other surprise expenses and I'm pretty much dry right now and coasting off of my credit card. I don't *think* this is too much of a problem right now because I can afford to take the hit to my credit and can pay it all off in January but that's only true if we find housing. So I need some advice/resources for finding housing.&amp;nbsp;**Some general info:**  * Both of us are 21  * My boyfriend's credit score is just above 650, mine is roughly 730 last I checked. * I have ~120 in my checking account, 120 in cash, ~1.2k available credit, and another ~0.5k available credit via Paypal Credit. My boyfriend doesn't have a credit card and as far as this post is concerned is basically dry.  * My boyfriend's last pay stub was from this month, mine was from October (or half way through this January since pay is biweekly.) * Our total monthly income would be somewhere around 2.1k before any reductions.  * Worst case scenario is he moves back in with his parents and I move over overseas to start fresh, but this would have a strong negative impact on his health and composure. We're both obviously trying to avoid this.&amp;nbsp;Right now it looks like either the both of us are going to be staying in a hotel until things get better or he'll move back with his parents and I'll stay in a hotel until can get things sorted out. I can (barely) afford to stay at a hotel alone while I work here (I'm going to have a electric burner to cook on and utilize the free breakfast to try and cut down on food costs) but this is obviously a short term solution and I can't seem to find a place that doesn't view me as a liability. Plus between the hotel/food expenses and my income those application/holding fees are going to start adding up *really* fast. Could you give me some advice?

ac5m7o	personalfinance	 I've found that I have issues with spending money...on myself. I've always been a bit on the frugal side. I've paid off my annoying loans, only things left are my wife's car and my mortgage. I'm building a nest egg...I've got 3k on hand in savings, always between 3-5K in checking, and looking to grow another 12k this year as my oh shit I lost my job emergency fund, probably in an investment account somewhere. No issues with debt:income ratio. I don't mind buying stuff for my kids or wife, but I feel guilty as hell buying things for myself. For example, on a whim I bought my wife and kid a Switch (Pokemon themed) on launch day for Lets Go Pikachu/Eevee (they are both huge Pokemon fans, I couldn't give a poke less). $400 spend, no fuck given. But I sit here kicking my ass about spending $30 on a video game for myself, or Gods forbid, thinking about a VR setup at home that would cost about the same as the Switch did.Last week I got an unexpected decent check from my mortgage company due to an escrow overage. $850. I could easily have it be fun money...but naw, my first instinct was to squirrel it away and get some maintenance done on the wife's car, because it was easier to do that mentally then to even consider what I could just blow it on.How do you justify spending some cash on yourself?

ady61s	AmItheAsshole	I need some help, Reddit. I’ll try to be as unbiased as possible and present both sides as fairly as I can.Presently, I [M27] am the sole provider for my family’s finances. I work tech support from 7am-4pm on weekdays, and I’m on call with a second job every weekend (Sat 9am-4pm and Sun 9am-9pm). My wife [F28] is a stay-at-home mom for our daughter [7], and she regularly keeps the house tidy, does laundry, often makes dinner, etc. She also hasn’t needed a job since we got married, as my salary has always covered us well enough. We have a modest house, a single used-car payment, and have decent finances compared to other low/middle class families.But lately, our finances have been getting worse than we’d prefer. We have several thousands of dollars in credit card debt (all from necessities, gas, groceries, etc), and only enough savings to last us a month (with roughly the same amount in our checking account). Long story short, we’re spending slightly more than I’m making, and it’s causing some strain.We’ve already made some of the simpler lifestyle adjustments (no unnecessary spending, less fast food, etc), but we’re still hurting financially. My proposed solution to this problem is for my wife to find a part-time job in town to work while our daughter is at school. As an act of fairness, I’d step up and help with housework appropriately. It’s not a perfect situation, and we’d definitely need some adjustment, but adding a part-time salary would relieve our entire financial situation in a few short months, and we’d build savings after that with her added income.The problem with my proposal is that my wife doesn’t want a job.Her proposal instead is for me to find a better/higher paying job. That way, things can stay as they are, but I’d be making more money. Right now, I’ve had the same position at my company for three and a half years, and it’s a great company, but I’ve tried to “climb the ladder” many times over the years with no success. As a response to this, our financial situation, and my wife’s desire, I’ve been considering switching jobs lately. My wife is hoping for me to get a position in management to increase my salary (though I don’t have the skills for management just yet, so that’s not really an option).The issue with her proposal is that I’m already near the salary ceiling for my position/skills. We crunched the numbers, and if I switch companies/jobs, I won’t be making any more money (or much more) at all.  Another consideration is that I’m pretty established in my current company (I was employee 14 in what’s now a growing 75 person startup), and if I move to another company, I’d be starting from square one in terms of tenure/reputation/impact. My wife and I have been having discussions about this on and off for a few months now, and she’s applied for three positions in that time, but because she doesn’t actually want a job, our conversations about it have become unfortunately intense.I want her to get a part-time job to help with the finances, she wants me to get a different/better job to help the finances, and our conversations often devolve into fights where one of us eventually leaves the room. Her resistance to help with the finances is weighing down on me, my pressure for her to work is weighing down on her, and our fights are weighing down on us both.

All this is fine, don't care not my issue.&amp;#x200B;I have been requesting that they buy my share of the house out as I am tired of the two of them living off my credit while I am forced to live in an apartment. They have been making all mortgage/insurance/utility payments since 2016 (which I had to go to a lawyer to get done but again, not my issue here). The house is deteriorating under their care. It is currently listed on the market, but as the real estate market has tanked here I am not very hopeful of the chances. They deny that there has been any deterioration of value under their care and claim that they are not financially able to take over the mortgage and remove me from the title.&amp;#x200B;My questions come down to this;&amp;#x200B;\-What are my options here? Is there a case to be made that they are impeding my ability to move on with my life and if so what is the best way to go about expressing that to a court?\-Does her consistent expression of unwillingness to leave the house during our separation and alternatively her consistent expression of intent to ""buy my share out"" weigh in my favor?&amp;#x200B;Thanks for the help I hope to discuss this with you all soon.&amp;#x200B;"	TIME	How long has it been since you left?

aevnrw	legaladvice	I work as a condo property manager in Illinois and was told to hire someone to clean up a portion of the property I manage. I was expecting it to be around $500, but because it was a more extensive project with over 300 man hours it turned out to be $7500. I've taken ownership of the issue and my boss said the association will be looking to recoup this money and the management company I work for won't want to pay it so I should think about how I can make it right. They then asked if I was open to a repayment plan.It may be a moot point since I'm moving and already gave my notice, but can I be held financially responsible for my epic fuck up?

af4j22	AmItheAsshole	I kinda feel like an asshole here but I want to know what you guys think. My wife's best friend is having infertility problems and none of the treatments are working. She asked my wife if she could be a surrogate out of the blue and after days of thinking about everything she decided that she's gonna help her friend. I understand that their bond is huge and what she is doing is noble but I really don't wanna be a part of this.  I have a couple of reasons:  1- My wife is gonna be pregnant with a kid that's not mine.    2- There could be complications or there is a possibility that she can have severe problems or outright die due to her existing conditions (Anemia).   3- I don't want to be helping her carry the baby for nine months just to give it away.    AITA here? Honestly I tried telling her in the most gentle way possible that I'm absolutely not on board with this but she is stuck calling me a sexist and an asshole.

afypod	legaladvice	For a bit of background: My husband was a naval aviator and then a commercial airline pilot. Due to some health concerns (high risk pregnancy for me, our resulting newborn, and a heart condition on his end) he decided to start looking for a different career. As his background is in engineering, he found a phenomenal job in his field as a private contractor for the Federal Government.  This of course means all of the background checks, etc., to allow him clearance and access into the place is he’ll need to go to perform his job.This is where things get tricky. A couple of months ago, my husband stopped into thegrocery store to pick up some onions.  For some reason, our debit card wouldn’t go through. More than likely he just entered an incorrect pin, but regardless he texted me to make sure I had transferred money into that account. I stated I had, but by the time I replied he said he had already put the onions back and left the store.A couple of weeks later he received a call from the local police department. The store had reported him for shoplifting. The officer stated that they had my husband on camera. This was very baffling, as my husband said he clearly walked the bag of onions back to the produce section and replaced them. The officer replied that it wasn’t the onions, but when my husband walked from the checkout stand to the produce department he had something red in his hand, and when he left the store he no longer had that in his hand. Guys, our debit card is a bright red Wells Fargo card. My husband informed the officer of that, and asked what they thought of the red object was, exactly? The officer couldn’t answer that, but advised my husband and the store had looked in other areas of the store where he had shopped and it appeared that a box he had been looking at had also been opened so it must have been one of the things from the box. My husband asked what was inside this box that was red and the officer did not know. Regardless of the store not actually being able to say what they think my husband took, the officer issued him a citation and gave him an optional court date for the 28th of this month. As a result, my husband has had to leave his temporary-pending-clearance role at his job until he goes to court and the charge is either dismissed or he is found innocent.This was over a week ago now, and even after the court date it’s possible that it will take him several more weeks to get his clearance back. The salary for his position breaks down to nearly $60 an hour, and even under the best of circumstances he will be out a month’s wages at that rate.First of all, what is the best way for us to approach this shoplifting charge? Anyone who knows my husband knows it’s completely bogus, and frankly it doesn’t sound like the store has anything other than paranoia and some poor video driving their case.Second, is there any way to go after the store for lost wages? After our myriad of health issues all hitting at practically one time, our family really needed this money. It’s in credulous to me that a business could throw out such a flaky accusations and a literally cost a family thousands upon thousands of dollars to deal with it.**TLDR**:  my husband was accused of shoplifting by a local grocery store, after their security footage caught him carrying out his own debit card and they thought it was a product from inside the store. Due to the pending charge and court date, my husband cannot work at his position which requires he have a federal security clearance. First of all, how do we deal with this flimsy charge?

aglogu	AmItheAsshole	My ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.A few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.The one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.This was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.Was I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?

One we are only paying 5/mo on to get out of default. Her parents have angrily, and begrudgingly taken on the majority of these payments as we cannot afford them. The true total of the loans is not known, but I believe it's north of 120k. The interest rates are not known. * Bills are 700+ (food, diapers, phones, car insurance, electricity, sewer, garbage, internet, gas $/bus fare, and therapy because suicide ideations/mental breakdowns). Income * 39k total, before tax. One income is 34k (no degree), the other is 5k (very part time, one day a week she works at a thrift store so we are able to get clothes for a few cents each) * the only government assistance we're on its WIC* visit food pantry weekly* prenatal care and some of babies medical were covered via nonprofitWithout taking on the vast majority of the school loans, we are still $500 under water every month. Genuinely confused how we are making it (are we?) without going into more debt each month. Scared to look at debt consolidation options, not sure what's real vs a scam or how to tell the difference. Her parents cosigned on the loans, they own a house. They are very difficult people, in general. Any discussion of the loans does not go well. They've only been in the house a few years, refinanced last year. Will they lose the house? How can we get out of this? 	TIME	What is the total of the loans?

ans8wm	legaladvice	"Right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. Here is the story.&amp;#x200B;Last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. While we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. My brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what I know it's one of his biggest hobbies. Well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal&amp;#x200B;Well, until yesterday. My brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and I needed to return it immediately. I honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. Well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a Boba Fett figure from his collection. He confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.&amp;#x200B;I was furious and took it from him. Here is the problem though, after I confirmed with my brother it was his I found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. Apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. So my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. Well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. I told him I would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. &amp;#x200B;Honestly, what are my options here? I can't afford to pay him back right now. If he does go the police will my son get arrested? He's only 15. It was very wrong of him to do but I think my brother is over reacting.

He was very sweet, and I liked spending time with him. He lived an hour and a half a way and would drive up all the time and stay at my house. My pet had a vet appointment near him (long story but no exotic vet in my area) and he came up for a day, we drove down the next, and drove back the day after so my pet could heal from surgery. My nana died the day we drove down and I wasn’t in the best mood. The day after this was my birthday. So at this point we had spent the last four days together. For my birthday we got lunch and went to dinner with my family. Then i wanted to go to a bar with my best friend. He got very upset that I didn’t want to spend my birthday with him (even though I did, and several days prior) and stormed out of my house. I angrily texted him at like 3am a little drunk that I was mad at him for making my birthday about him. He ignored me for four days until he called me last night and broke up with me (the day before Valentine’s day.) I understand that he drove a lot for me, and I thanked him a ton and offered gas money, but I feel like this is a weird thing to be dumped over?

at2j2l	personalfinance	I don't even know where to start... I am at a really low point in my life. Which is saying a lot!! Well to start maybe a little background. I am a recovering Heroin addict and I have been sober for over two years. I know I will probably get a lot of negative responses from just that alone but it's fine. So in the past two years I had completely rebuilt my life. I went to a sober living home for 8 months, during that time I saved, bought a car, and got my own place. It was extremely hard learning how to do all of that for what was basically the first time in my life but I managed really well. I had a nice little set up for myself that I was very proud of. Well in the past two months my life has been completely turned upside down. It started with the transmission going out in my car. Being that I worked a minimum wage job I certainly had no savings to get it fixed. So it got repossesed. After that things went down hill a lot faster. I was relying on friends I had made through work to help me when they could for rides to work and I would walk to the store if needed. My former employer knew my situation so when rides fell through they were pretty understanding but eventually they had to let me go. Which I am not mad at them at all and I understand completely. Needless to say I was evicted shortly after that. Luckily my mother has let me sleep on her couch for right now. She works two jobs to provide for herself and my younger siblings and barely gets by as it is so she really doesn't need the extra stress of me being here. She definitely can not help with transportation to a job. My other family hasn't quite forgiven me for the wreckage of my past (and I don't blame them) so I have no outside help at all. I feel very stuck right now and I have no idea how to get out of this hole I am in. I had help the first time around from the sober living program I was in. I had thought about that as well and it is a place for people fresh in recovery so that is not an option. I know all of this is of my own making and I should have had my life together a long time ago.I just need all of the advice I can get right now. Where can I start?

auqnv1	Advice	"  This is a true story. Details have been changed to protect all parties involvedA colleague of mine recently submitted a request to work from home once a week. The circumstances are as follows: A few months ago, her one-year old son was diagnosed with a rare, terminal disease. After months in the hospital, her once perfectly healthy baby now has a breathing tube and feeding tube. He has multiple seizures daily or per week and calling 911 or racing to the hospital has become a norm. Home health aides, nurses and hospice care are in and out of their home daily. Her son will most likely not survive to the age of two.She and her husband have been on FMLA (unpaid leave – protects employment) since the first hospital stint… they did work on and off, in the office, from the hospital and from home.  Currently, she has returned to work in the office full-time. She lives 60 miles from the institution. Her department works on laptops. They do not leave their desks – no forward-facing work.The institution’s HR policy states an employee can work from home if *approved by their direct report/management.* In several departments, throughout the institution, working from home is common under special circumstances (Example: When a mother returns from maternity leave, a department manager may approve she can work from home one day a week, to assist with caring for her newborn baby.)The employee submitted a request in October of 2018 to work from home. She received her answer in February of 2019 (after several inquiries regarding the request’s status). She was not denied permission; however, it was clear her management team was not pleased with the request. She was told she can work from home every third Friday. If it snows, and the roads are bad, she must drive in or choose to stay home and take a personal day. (Please note: During inclement weather, nurses and home health aides commonly call-out, as they too have their own families.)Her management team stated, *“If we allow you to consistently work from home, other staff members may expect the same privilege.”*Then, my colleague contacted HR – hoping something else could done. HR’s response, *“If management is consistent with all employees, there is nothing we can do.""*My colleague is heartbroken, stressed, and feels defeated.I am posting this for two reasons:1. Is there any advice someone can offer for my colleague? She can’t quit, as her family needs health insurance (the medical bills are already astronomical) and finding a new job would be difficult under these circumstances.2. Perhaps, I’m bias or just a rational person with empathy or both! … but I need to understand *WHY?* Why did the management team keep the request for over four months, and then, basically deny it? Why would a leadership team show little to no empathy for their employees? What do they gain? And how does HR not see a breach of protocol and policy? Clearly, these are extenuating circumstances - the woman’s child is dying - and yet, working from home once a week is seen as a “privilege” by her management team? It’s revolting, and as an employee of the same institution, I am both horrified and embarrassed by their actions.

Currently, she has returned to work in the office full-time. She lives 60 miles from the institution. Her department works on laptops. They do not leave their desks – no forward-facing work.The institution’s HR policy states an employee can work from home if *approved by their direct report/management.* In several departments, throughout the institution, working from home is common under special circumstances (Example: When a mother returns from maternity leave, a department manager may approve she can work from home one day a week, to assist with caring for her newborn baby.)The employee submitted a request in October of 2018 to work from home. She received her answer in February of 2019 (after several inquiries regarding the request’s status). She was not denied permission; however, it was clear her management team was not pleased with the request. She was told she can work from home every third Friday. If it snows, and the roads are bad, she must drive in or choose to stay home and take a personal day. (Please note: During inclement weather, nurses and home health aides commonly call-out, as they too have their own families.)Her management team stated, *“If we allow you to consistently work from home, other staff members may expect the same privilege.”*Then, my colleague contacted HR – hoping something else could done. HR’s response, *“If management is consistent with all employees, there is nothing we can do.""*My colleague is heartbroken, stressed, and feels defeated.I am posting this for two reasons:1. Is there any advice someone can offer for my colleague? She can’t quit, as her family needs health insurance (the medical bills are already astronomical) and finding a new job would be difficult under these circumstances.2. Perhaps, I’m bias or just a rational person with empathy or both! … but I need to understand *WHY?* Why did the management team keep the request for over four months, and then, basically deny it? Why would a leadership team show little to no empathy for their employees? What do they gain? And how does HR not see a breach of protocol and policy? Clearly, these are extenuating circumstances - the woman’s child is dying - and yet, working from home once a week is seen as a “privilege” by her management team? It’s revolting, and as an employee of the same institution, I am both horrified and embarrassed by their actions. "	TIME	Why would a leadership team have no empathy for their employees?

awq7v4	Advice	I recently took a DNA test, not expecting anything other than some regular ethnicity stuff, but I was instantly matched with a person it suggested was my 1st cousin, that I didn’t know at all. (I was also matched with my sibling and distant relatives of all 4 grandparents, so I’m definitely still who I think I am.)This person had included a family tree on their profile that they’d put together based on personal research, not DNA, and NO ONE matched up among our families. After thinking up several scenarios, I did a comparison of distant cousins who actually share DNA with both of us, and it looks like this person HAS to be my uncle’s kid. My senior citizen bachelor uncle with no kids. He has lamented over not having children, so I genuinely believe he has no idea this adult child exists. The “cousin” has not logged into the service since I became a match, and I don’t know if they suspect that the entire paternal line of their family tree is incorrect. Is it at all my place to barge in and let either of these people know about each other? What if the mom of this cousin really didn’t want my uncle in their child’s life? What if I talk to one of them but the other doesn’t want to be connected? Do I just wait and see if the cousin notices me and WANTS to figure out how we’re related?

b2wgt0	AmItheAsshole	A few notes; I have a full sized truck, live in an apartment building, and have an infant still in a huge reverse car seat. Getting the kiddo in and out of the truck requires the door to be pretty far open and I'm terrified of hitting another car with the door so I park as close to the opposite line as I can without being on it. This leaves my passenger side with a crap ton of room and allows me not to worry. This doesn't leave much room for me to get out or the person next to me to get in so I always try to park in the last spot but it's not always available. I pull in my mirrors when next to another large vehicle to try and help with the spacing but am I still the asshole for knowingly giving the other person less room to get in and out if I'm still technically in my spot?

We would also be paying nothing out of pocket since they are gathering the entire stay's money to send to me, but they need me actually rent it because apparently you must be 25 to rent it out.I am obviously worried about things getting out of hand and something happening to the house because I would be responsible for the $500 damage charge. Also, they will be drinking while at this house and I don't want to be responsible for that kind of illegal activity. She says it's in a pretty remote location and no one will ever know. Is there a way to have this happen while also covering our own asses? Is there any other cautions I haven't thought of?	EXPERT	Are you familiar with how AirBnB works?

I asked what that was and after some explanation I knew that it was fake and a fad. I told her I would not accept her and would not use her new pronouns (xe xm) I have no clue how you even use them. she then locked herself in her room for 5 hours crying. this was last week and she is now not talking to me unless I use her xe xm pronouns.I found a camp for kids with mental health problems and thought I would sign her up. my parents are against it and my ex husband agrees with them.

When my son was a baby my FIL started calling him by his middle name. I asked him to stop, and told him how important the name was to me. FIL then said that he would always be known as C to him. I told him, mostly jokingly, that if he kept calling R that, then I would change his surname to my maiden name. Everyone laughed. Since then however, both MIL and FIL refer to him as C, but not around me, only around my husband. R doesn't like it, and has told them C is not his name.  My husband has asked them to stop, but there is a pretty strained relationship there so he's reluctant to rock the boat.

bg0cw3	AmItheAsshole	Just as a preface I work as a cashier for a pretty big grocery store, the job sucks most days because some managers are incompetent and like to either micro manage or do absolutely nothing. The job pays less than minimum wage because we have less than 25 employees but everyone still gets about 27 hours a week because people with seniority get the hours (which is fine). This September will be my second year working there.Now there is a system in place to request days off. Basically you just have to do it at least 2 weeks before the schedule is set but you can do it as far back as 5 months. I had a trip coming up in July that was very important to me. So last November I told every manager I could including the director at the time that I would like to request those days in July off as my vacation I get every year. All of them said it was fine. So I reminded them in December and January that I wanted them again. In February as soon as I could I requested my vacation week in July and reminded them again. I have reminded them at least once a month since. We even got a new director and he said it was fine. Now last week I was talking to a coworker and brought up that I requested these day and he say oh really I was actually planning some thing that week too, I asked him if he requested the days and he said no not yet I'll just wait till the end but they'll give them to me because I have seniority, he then told me that another co worker was going to request that week as well and that she also had seniority. Both these people only have maybe 1 to 3 years on me but seniority is taken very seriously at this job. I later asked the co manager( who makes the schedule) If I could still get those days off and she said she didn't know she would have to see because other people requested it that day. Usually taling a week off isn't a big deal but the problem is that 3 people want to so they may only let 1 maybe 2 go. So I thought if I don't get these vacation days then that's it I'm perfectly ok with losing this job. I drive for uber, postmates, Lyft, doordash, and uber eats, on my time off so I could do that until I find another job or just continue going to school.  So my question is, WIBTA if I just don't show up to work if they schedule me on the days I requested?	EXPERT	On a separate note, why the fuck are you taking less than minimum wage?

bg0yvp	AmItheAsshole	Hello,&amp;#x200B;I wanted to ask: AITA for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?&amp;#x200B;Last month I took part in a retreat. The location's internet didn't work, so we all just had our mobile data. There was a deaf participant from Russia, and he couldn't access the mobile network with his phone. So he asked me if I could give him access through hotspot so he can communicate with his family.I have limited mobile data, I get 500mb per month and from there on, I pay 5 bucks for each 100mb (it's pretty expensive here). I only use mobile data for WhatsApp and maybe sometimes to check my schedule. So I agreed to give him hotspot under the condition that he only uses it for WhatsApp. No videos, no excessive photo transmissions because it's limited. He agreed.&amp;#x200B;But when I got lasts month bill I was kinda shocked: he apparently used over 6GB additionally. I was able to track it down to him because this huge amount of data was consumed during these two retreat days. But before confronting him via Facebook, I asked a friend who was his roommate, if he noticed anything. He told me that this Russian guy did sign language videochat the whole night through with his parents. I asked my friend if he had the impression that it were an emergency, but he said that their chat seemed very lighthearted and included lots of laughing.&amp;#x200B;So I don't know what to do. The bill is over 60 bucks, my budget doesn't really allow it. And I told the deaf guy in advance to only use WhatsApp, but I didn't get a warning that he was using so much data, so he maybe didn't even realize it. In addition, my friend told me that I should give him the benefit of being disabled where videochatting is often the easiest way of communication...

bh1ax4	AmItheAsshole	"So, I met a girl on a dating app this past weekend. Since the start of our conversations, something felt a bit... Off.First, her profile stated that she was 26, but she said that she couldn't be out too late because of a curfew. I blew it off as maybe she lives with her overprotective parents. I planned on asking more about it on the date. Next, she wanted to meet up on Easter. I don't personally celebrate, but I know that most places are closed and families usually have plans. There would be almost nothing to do. Finally, before we decided to meet, our conversation within the app disappeared, meaning that she blocked me or temporarily deleted the app. Today, the conversation reappeared and she apologized very purfusely and asked to meet up today. She said she was ready *at that very moment*. At this point in sketched out as hell, but I also have a tendency to overthink things so I decided to meet up after I finished my errands.I went to pick her up from her house and when I pulled up there was a white car with two guys in the front seat. It was about 60 degrees F and they both had on coats with their hoods pulled up, looking down and obviously avoiding eye contact and making sure to cover their faces. When she came up to the car I locked the doors and rolled down the window. I asked her who the guys were and she said ""They're my friends, they are just smoking."" I looked back at the car and one guy looked up and back down quickly, then closed the driver's side door, which was previously open. There was no smoke coming from the car, not a cigarette or any weed in sight. I told her it was too sketchy and I left. She later texted me that I was an asshole and her friends were minding their own business.So Reddit, lay it on me. AITA?"	LOC	Did I mention NTA?

I planned on asking more about it on the date. Next, she wanted to meet up on Easter. I don't personally celebrate, but I know that most places are closed and families usually have plans. There would be almost nothing to do. Finally, before we decided to meet, our conversation within the app disappeared, meaning that she blocked me or temporarily deleted the app. Today, the conversation reappeared and she apologized very purfusely and asked to meet up today. She said she was ready *at that very moment*. At this point in sketched out as hell, but I also have a tendency to overthink things so I decided to meet up after I finished my errands.I went to pick her up from her house and when I pulled up there was a white car with two guys in the front seat. It was about 60 degrees F and they both had on coats with their hoods pulled up, looking down and obviously avoiding eye contact and making sure to cover their faces. When she came up to the car I locked the doors and rolled down the window. I asked her who the guys were and she said ""They're my friends, they are just smoking."" I looked back at the car and one guy looked up and back down quickly, then closed the driver's side door, which was previously open. There was no smoke coming from the car, not a cigarette or any weed in sight. I told her it was too sketchy and I left. She later texted me that I was an asshole and her friends were minding their own business.So Reddit, lay it on me. AITA?"	LOC	How would you feel if she did that to you?

bhbizh	personalfinance	I recently just accepted a job within walking distance of my apartment in DC.  I still owe $5,200 on a 3 year old vehicle that has a current trade-in value of $18,000.  I pay $480 / month on the loan and about $90 / month on insurance (total monthly cost of $570).  Now that I'll be able to walk to work and would likely only use my car for weekend trips, is it worth keeping?  Since I'm still in my twenties, I was thinking of selling it and taking that monthly expenditure and routing it to a Roth IRA.  Thoughts?	EXPERT	Can you rent out your parking spot?

bhcit5	Advice	I've been really depressed and sick lately and have been spending a lot of time alone because of it, usually in bed or on the computer. My husband gets really angry at me for not going places with him to the point where he physically throws things at me (usually it's just things like plastic/paper/cardboard but sometimes he throws things that could actually hurt me). He also threatens to destroy electronics that I use, I always try to calm him down but he never does and I get scared that he will hurt me. I just don't know what to do.

bi10jn	Advice	Hi all. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Some background: I (17F) have been babysitting since I was 12, and have been babysitting for this particular family, which consists of 3 kids (currently ages 3, 6, and 9) since I was 14. I adore the kids and the family. I babysit for them often, even staying over night a few times.Where I live, according to care.com, the rate is about $14.50/hour for all the things I do as a sitter (keep the kids ofc, clean, drive kids around, homework help, cook, give baths, etc.), and i always charge &amp;10/hour, which I think is fair. On to the situation. The mom reached out to me asking if I could keep their youngest all day when they take their oldest to the beach to celebrate her birthday. She asked me to come at 7:30 AM and estimated they would be home around 9:30 PM. So, 14 hours. I agreed. So the day comes (yesterday), and I show up at 7:30 and it turns out I’m keeping both of the youngest kids. Okay, no problem. Wish I knew before hand, but, no problem. The mom told me he would be with the neighbors a lot throughout the day (his best friend lives there). The middle child was also already awake when I got there.Throughout the day, I spent about $17-ish dollars of my own money on them, as they didn’t leave any spending money (despite that all their suggestions of what we do with the day included going out and spending money). I honestly didn’t mind though because I figured I would get paid adequately. I made sure the kids had a blast, we went to the park, got donuts, went to the play place at chick fil a, played outside for hours, etc.. The only times that the middle child spent any time with the neighbors, it was in the front yard and I was monitoring (unlike the mom said). I think it’s also important to note that the 3 year old is kind of going through a “terrible 3’s phase”, and she has been very difficult and defiant lately, which makes things quite difficult. The parents know and acknowledge this). After giving them a bath (not to mention we used a bath bomb I bought them) the kids finally went to bed at 8:30. I cleaned the house till 9:00, and they got home around 9:30. They were very appreciative like always. The mother wrote the check, folded it in half and gave it to me (she normally did this). I left, and when I got in my car I noticed I only got $100. That’s $40 less than what I expected for working for 14 hours. This has happened before with this family. There have even a couple of instances where they would underpay me like $10-$15, but I always let it go because although they aren’t poor, they defiantly aren’t rich. Another very important factor is that the mother is my moms co worker, which is how I met the family in the first place. They both work at a preschool, and they are good acquaintances. I don’t want to just never babysit for them again, because they are where I get most of my money because they ask me to babysit so often. It would be a huge toll if I stopped. I also have to be delicate because I wouldn’t want to make things awkward for my mom at work. I want to address this, perhaps over a text message because this is our main form of communication all the time. What the hell should I say???	EXPERT	Is the $10/hour rate still alright with you?

bi3tz2	AmItheAsshole	My husband values material things highly, and gets upset if something he owns gets damaged in any way. And I’m not talking large, expensive items. If the spine of a paperback book is opened all the way and cracked, it’s ruined. He once returned and reordered a DVD from Amazon 4 times because there were minor cracks on the case. This past Christmas, my parents gifted us a new Apple TV. The remote is glass. We have two boys, a very rambunctious almost 3 year old and a 1 year old. In January, the 3 year old picked the remote up off the couch and dropped it, causing it to crack. I was immediately worried because my husband had been having a terrible week. Let me preface the next few sentences by saying that my husband has never been physically abusive in any way toward me or our children. My husband’s fuse is short. He is angered easily, and he is not a calm angry person. He screams and shouts and says cruel things. Every little thing the 3 year old did that week was setting him off, and I was starting to see the 3 year old being afraid of him. So I told my husband the baby did it. The baby was in a phase of grabbing and throwing anything he could get his hands on, so it was totally plausible. I had assumed that my husband would realize that a tiny defenseless baby would not have done it out of malice, and that he would be much easier on the baby than on the 3 year old. I was wrong. I should have just told him I accidentally dropped it. He would have been furious with me, but that would have been the end of it. From that day on, my husband has shown an obvious and strong favoritism toward our 3 year old. He’s even said on occasion things like, “3 year old is my favorite.” And, “I don’t like baby.” It has honestly broken my heart. The baby feels everything bigger than his brother, and babies are perceptive. Even my mom has commented that she thinks the baby can sense that his father dislikes him. Now to the event I am asking about. Last night, I was cooking dinner, and my husband was supposed to be getting the baby down to sleep. He was getting a cup of milk ready for baby when I noticed baby was crawling around with the Apple TV remote in his hand. I mentioned it to my husband so he could go grab the remote from baby. My husband responded with something along the lines of, “What does it matter? He’s already ruined it.” I responded with, “funny story. It’s actually 3 year old who broke it.” My husband lost it. He called me a liar and said that he couldn’t trust me. He blamed me for his dislike of baby, saying, “you’ll have to live with the fact that YOU are the reason I don’t like baby!” He then told me that I owed him an apology for lying. I absolutely refused. I told him that I would not apologize for trying to protect my child (the 3 year old). Now he won’t even talk to me or be in the same room with me.

bkdol0	personalfinance	Hello everyone, as the title suggests I will be graduating college with over 120k in student loan debt. My parents and I made the decision to go to this school because it offers very good placement into Econ/finance which is what O have been aiming to study. Due to our family income level we are considered the lowest end of upper-middle class so we paid full tuition over the four years. My parents were able to contribute a total of 100k over four years and took out 80k in loans. I am responsible for the remaining 120k. I’m graduating with a double degree in Econ and CS and I will be starting as an entry level consultant at a medium sized consulting firm in the Boston area. I don’t think I would have been able to get this job without the opportunities I got at my college. Of course, on the other hand, I’m saddled with so much debt.

bl7d35	AmItheAsshole	I always knew my daughter really liked to draw but she always liked to draw mythical creatures like dragons. I never expected anything vulgar from her until today when she was rushing out the door for school I noticed she dropped her sketchbook so I went to bring it to her and to my surprise- there was multiple pages of nude drawings of men AND a women. I was appalled. Don’t get me wrong I understand the concept of this for artists and that it’s normal for artists but my daughter is only 14. She has absolutely no business with these types of drawings. She was out the door before I could say anything. Obviously they cannot allow nude models in school so the only other explanation is that she has been viewing the images on 18+ websites. I did what I had to and went on her laptop (which her father and I paid for, btw) to see the history and as suspected a website full of adult nude models and even google searches for specific poses. I waited until my daughter got home and confronted her, i tried to be calm as I could and explained that she has no business viewing 18+ images and those models can get in big trouble if the police find out and underaged girl is viewing them. I told her I would then be confiscating her sketchbook and laptop until she agrees to draw something more age appropriate. i think that this is fair as she can have her stuff back immediately once she agrees, but she is mad and refusing to give in. If she need to practice drawing humans she can draw them from her head not from an adult websites. AITA?	EXPERT	YTA, have you forgotten what it's like to be 14?

I was appalled. Don’t get me wrong I understand the concept of this for artists and that it’s normal for artists but my daughter is only 14. She has absolutely no business with these types of drawings. She was out the door before I could say anything. Obviously they cannot allow nude models in school so the only other explanation is that she has been viewing the images on 18+ websites. I did what I had to and went on her laptop (which her father and I paid for, btw) to see the history and as suspected a website full of adult nude models and even google searches for specific poses. I waited until my daughter got home and confronted her, i tried to be calm as I could and explained that she has no business viewing 18+ images and those models can get in big trouble if the police find out and underaged girl is viewing them. I told her I would then be confiscating her sketchbook and laptop until she agrees to draw something more age appropriate. i think that this is fair as she can have her stuff back immediately once she agrees, but she is mad and refusing to give in. If she need to practice drawing humans she can draw them from her head not from an adult websites. AITA?	EXPERT	YTA - What the fuck is wrong with you?

bqflu9	AmItheAsshole	Married 5 years, no children. So I have some baggage, first and foremost. I was the oldest of 5 and my mom was an abusive alcoholic. Dad not in the picture. I was forced to raise my younger sibs as a result and hated it. I really had no childhood and went back to college in my late 20s because I never had the chance to focus on myself. As a result I really cannot stand children until the age of 14. I can’t stand their shrieks, their erratic movements, their whining, their sticky hands, their drool. I can go on. My husband and I are both childless and we’re happy that way. Two years ago my husbands brother and sisters started popping out children nearly at the same time. He now has a niece and nephew both under 2 year old. They live about 30-40 minutes away. My husband wants his sister and her baby to come over during the day (he works from home) so they can have lunch or walks together. He needs to stay at ours in order to work, but they like the idea of spending an hour together in the middle of the day while my SIL plays with her baby for 2-3 hrs. I really don’t feel comfortable with this and have told him so. There’s something deeply uncomfortable with having young children in my living space, even when I’m not there. I would hate coming home to the smell of diapers or baby food or spit up. We’re fighting because my husband thinks I’m being unreasonable to ban all children from our home even when I’m not there. I think since it’s our shared home I should get a say on which guests can enter. AITA?	LOC	YTA - you're stopping him from seeing his family, how is this even a question?	Tired of diaper smells??

bygnly	legaladvice	We bought our home in 2004 on a one acre lot in a suburb in Virginia. In 2014, our next door neighbor who had lived next door since our houses were built, passed away. In 2015, a young family moved in. In 2016, we had a survey done in order to build a fence. The surveyors found that a 3x 3 foot area of neighbors driveway is on our property.Consulted a local real estate attorney recommended to us by the attorney who handled our wills. He recommended that we kindly approach new neighbors, discuss the situation, and ask them to sign a “permission of use” letter stating they have our permission to use the part of their driveway that is on our property.They refused! Mumbled something about a family member recommending they not sign it.Went back to our attorney who said “huh that is very strange. Nothing you can do now but take them to court, which could lead to hard feelings”.My main (only) concern is that we don’t want any trouble if we try to sell in a few years.

c17hpk	AmItheAsshole	  My boyfriend Cam and I have been dating since early this year. It’s been great for the most part, but for the past couple of months we’ve been having arguments about his friend Lauren. Lauren and I don’t really get along. She’s like a sister to Cam so I tried to befriend her when we started dating, but she was always aloof to me. She’s very friendly with other people, but whenever I tried to talk to her, she would just answer with a few words then talk to someone else or leave. She would also make me feel out of place whenever we hung out with Cam’s other friends by bringing up things from their college days so everyone would be talking or laughing about something that I don’t know. I told Cam how I felt but he said that I must be misreading the situation because Lauren is not that kind of person. He said that I should give it more time, that maybe Lauren doesn’t know me that well yet that’s why she doesn’t talk to me a lot. But I know that she has befriended people who were introduced to her after I was, like Arlo, Cam’s friend from his new job which he started in March. The three of them play online games for hours while she hasn’t spent 3 minutes talking to me. More than once I asked Cam to talk to Lauren about why she doesn’t like me, but he refused. He said that unless Lauren was ignoring me or talking shit about me, she technically isn’t doing anything wrong by not being besties with me, and it would just make things awkward between the three of us. One time I told him that would talk to Lauren myself, and he said that I was making a mountain out of a molehill.Last Friday was Cam’s birthday so I threw a small dinner party at his favorite restaurant for him and invited our friends, excluding Lauren. I figured that I’m the one throwing the party so I should be able to invite who I want to, and I don’t want to invite and pay for someone who has shown time and time again that she doesn’t like my company and is not interested in being friends with me. Cam was really happy about the surprise at first, but when he learned that Lauren wasn’t going to be there, he pulled me aside and said I was an asshole for leaving Lauren out. He said I should’ve thought about how Lauren would feel if she learns that I invited everyone except her. I was shocked that he would say that when he knew how Lauren has treated me, so I told him that I just gave Lauren a taste of her own medicine and maybe now she’ll know how I feel when she leaves me out of conversations. Cam got really angry and said that he can’t be with someone who would treat Lauren like that. He stormed out of the restaurant and we’ve only talked once after that. I texted him yesterday to apologize and he said we should meet in person today to talk about this. I don’t even know what I should say to him.Am I the asshole?

c1gr3n	AmItheAsshole	I was in the TSA Precheck line where people are generally cognizant of the regulations. Unfortunately, a woman with her 3 children somehow ended up in this line. I have no patience for people who hold up the TSA screening line. This woman had to fish out all her feeding bottles from her 3 or 4 poorly organized bags and empty them before putting her belongings through security screening. As a result, she held up the security line for a long time. I finally had it and told her she should have been aware of the rules about liquids before getting in line and should have prepared for security screening before getting in line. I suggested that she step aside and let other travelers through and my suggestion was met with a few cheers. She seemed really embarrassed but didn’t apologize at all. After I passed the screen I mentioned to the TSA agent he should manage the queue better. When a traveler was holding up the line he needed to step in, and he failed. He apologized and I moved on.

c1wmya	AmItheAsshole	Sorry, English isn’t my first language.I’m gay, my boyfriend is bisexual.I’m admittedly insecure and occasionally have jealousy issues. My boyfriend is insanely attractive and, while I’m not “ugly” by any standards, I’m nothing compared to him.It bothers me that he can virtually have anyone of either gender. I’m afraid that he will leave me for someone else.It’s always bothered me that he is also attracted to girls. I don’t really get it. Why is he attracted to other people (of the other gender) when he is dating me (who is a guy) ?I’ve never really gotten the whole “bisexual” thing. Maybe I’m shallow.We were watching a movie with another friend (his friend, who is a lesbian) when his friend made a remark (to him). She pointed out that one of the girls in the movie was “hot”. My boyfriend kinda shrugged and said that “she’s cute”.I don’t know why, but that really bothered me. I didnt want to make a scene, so I waited until his friend left. We had already talked about him and his attraction to women. I’m not saying that he can’t be attracted to women, just that I personally don’t “get” it, and I don’t want to know about it either.He apologized, said he forgot and that he was just responding to his friend. That’s understandable, but then he said that he “can’t just stop his attraction for women”. Which started a whole argument. I told him that he shouldn’t be attracted to other people when he’s in a relationship, he said otherwise.He said that its okay to find other people attractive, just as long as you don’t act on it. I said that he only thought that because he was bisexual, and that all bisexual people think like that. He said that it wasn’t true, and I told him that he should just pick a side at this point. He is a guy, dating a guy, so he should just he gay. There’s no need to be attracted to women unless he has the intent to cheat on me.I guess that made him upset, because he told me that he wasn’t going to talk about this with me and he left. I really couldn’t tell if he was mad or not but he just left. His sister called me a few hours ago and told me that I was being a jerk. This isn’t the first time this has happened. She said she doesn’t even know why my boyfriend is still with me, implying that I’m *always* a jerk.I don’t think I said anything wrong.

Why is he attracted to other people (of the other gender) when he is dating me (who is a guy) ?I’ve never really gotten the whole “bisexual” thing. Maybe I’m shallow.We were watching a movie with another friend (his friend, who is a lesbian) when his friend made a remark (to him). She pointed out that one of the girls in the movie was “hot”. My boyfriend kinda shrugged and said that “she’s cute”.I don’t know why, but that really bothered me. I didnt want to make a scene, so I waited until his friend left. We had already talked about him and his attraction to women. I’m not saying that he can’t be attracted to women, just that I personally don’t “get” it, and I don’t want to know about it either.He apologized, said he forgot and that he was just responding to his friend. That’s understandable, but then he said that he “can’t just stop his attraction for women”. Which started a whole argument. I told him that he shouldn’t be attracted to other people when he’s in a relationship, he said otherwise.He said that its okay to find other people attractive, just as long as you don’t act on it. I said that he only thought that because he was bisexual, and that all bisexual people think like that. He said that it wasn’t true, and I told him that he should just pick a side at this point. He is a guy, dating a guy, so he should just he gay. There’s no need to be attracted to women unless he has the intent to cheat on me.I guess that made him upset, because he told me that he wasn’t going to talk about this with me and he left. I really couldn’t tell if he was mad or not but he just left. His sister called me a few hours ago and told me that I was being a jerk. This isn’t the first time this has happened. She said she doesn’t even know why my boyfriend is still with me, implying that I’m *always* a jerk.I don’t think I said anything wrong. I feel like what I said makes sense, but his sister doesn’t agree. AITA?	EXPERT	What is wrong with you?	What is wrong with that person?	expert vs. novice	-1
c2cmv9	AmItheAsshole	To start this off, I love my sister. I support her 100%. When she told me she is trans I got behind it immediately. I referred to her with the correct pronouns privately and used her chosen name for a full year before she came out. I fought for her when members of our family rejected her and I would and have immediately cut anyone off if they are in any way hateful towards her. When she came out she was embraced by many but rejected were loudly by enough people for it to be absolutely devastating. As a result we became very close and spend much more time together than we did before. Now, for the shitty part. Ever since she came out she’s been getting progressively more annoying. She FAKES stupidity, like will actually put on a 2000’s style Paris Hilton ditzy act. She’s taken up cattiness that she never ever had in her before and just recently I caught her pretending not to know how to put windshield wiper fluid in her car. Like, she actually created this whole scene where she was confused and needed help doing a task I know she can do because she taught me to do it when I got my license!A cousin eventually said something to her which resulted in a lot of tears and her calling that cousin transphobic (i know he’s not but he did come on really strong telling her that she was being fucking annoying) so I know that I have to tread very carefully.Now I’m wondering if this is just kind of like her going through the same self discovery I went through as a teenager and it will pass?

He didn’t speak a word to me and I thought he was very shy. The mom just told me that I would have to look after the house and feed him. And she told me the hours I had to work and I gave an hourly rate. She was doing a tour of everything and showed me his room. When I was in there I noticed a box of diapers in the corner, one diaper on the dresser and a box of wipes. I got a little concerned and asked her about it. I thought she would just say the diaper is only because of nightly bed wetting. Turns out her son has autism, he is not really verbal and not potty trained. I told her that I charge more when I have to give that much care. She got angry and said she was going to report me to the website. And that it’s illegal and discriminatory to charge her more for her sons disability. My usual rate is cheaper than most. I only do older children that I basically just have to be in the room with. I do homework and study for classes for majority of the time. I’ve only had like 4-5 special needs clients and they required more care so I charge more. The other parents were upfront about the child’s needs and what my duties were (diapers, hitting, spitting, bitting, cleanups, constant monitoring)  She never mentioned her son being special needs since we’ve been talking that’s why I told her the cheaper price.She also threatened to report me to the board of nursing, even though I didn’t get hired as a CNA.

caiqdh	AmItheAsshole	My wife has a younger brother (29) who has been in a relationship with his high school sweetheart (who's also a 29 year old male) for about 12 years. I think of both of them as my family, they're my children's uncles, we spend a bunch of time together and we get along great. I recently had a vasectomy, I'm 44, we have 3 kids and we aren't planning on having any more. After one Sunday lunch with our BILs, we sent the kids away and us adults had some drinks and started talking about my vasectomy. At one point, I said how great it was to finally not have to worry about protection, and how great it felt without it. And I said I almost feel sorry for them not experiencing it. My BIL laughed and said: What are you talking about, we haven't used protection since high school.I was going to reply something, but the kids came running in so I dropped the topic. I later thought about what he said and talked to my wife about it, saying that I don't think it's safe for them to be having sex without condoms, as a couple of gay men, and my wife laughed at me. Apparently, just because they've been together for a long time, it's safe? She told me to drop it and let them live their lives however they want.I thought it was ridiculous of her to have that reaction to her own brother not using protection and realized she wasn't going to tell them anything about it. So I figured I would buy some condoms and give them to my BILs and tell them I was worried about their safety and that they should really rethink not using protection.A couple of days ago, we had another lunch together, we sent the kids away again, and I gave them the condoms. I rehearsed a whole speech about how I wouldn't want anything to happen to them and that they should stay safe. But, rather than seeing my gesture for what it was - a gesture of care - they were offended. They asked if I am suggesting they shouldn't trust each other? They said they had never slept with anyone else their whole lives and if they managed to have an exciting enough sex life not to cheat on each other for 12 years, they'll probably manage the same in the future. And my wife's brother also said that, by the same token, I should be continuing to wear condoms despite having had a vasectomy. After shouting at me for 10 minutes, they just left. My wife has been incredibly mad with me and demanded I apologize to them, but I refuse to apologize for caring about their health and safety. I don't see how what I did was THIS horrible. They could have just declined the condoms. And their arguments are ridiculous. So what if they've been together for 12 years? People have cheated on each other after being together for longer than that.	EXPERT	Wtf is it with people feeling the need to take unilateral action without talking to the people it would impact?

I later thought about what he said and talked to my wife about it, saying that I don't think it's safe for them to be having sex without condoms, as a couple of gay men, and my wife laughed at me. Apparently, just because they've been together for a long time, it's safe? She told me to drop it and let them live their lives however they want.I thought it was ridiculous of her to have that reaction to her own brother not using protection and realized she wasn't going to tell them anything about it. So I figured I would buy some condoms and give them to my BILs and tell them I was worried about their safety and that they should really rethink not using protection.A couple of days ago, we had another lunch together, we sent the kids away again, and I gave them the condoms. I rehearsed a whole speech about how I wouldn't want anything to happen to them and that they should stay safe. But, rather than seeing my gesture for what it was - a gesture of care - they were offended. They asked if I am suggesting they shouldn't trust each other? They said they had never slept with anyone else their whole lives and if they managed to have an exciting enough sex life not to cheat on each other for 12 years, they'll probably manage the same in the future. And my wife's brother also said that, by the same token, I should be continuing to wear condoms despite having had a vasectomy. After shouting at me for 10 minutes, they just left. My wife has been incredibly mad with me and demanded I apologize to them, but I refuse to apologize for caring about their health and safety. I don't see how what I did was THIS horrible. They could have just declined the condoms. And their arguments are ridiculous. So what if they've been together for 12 years? People have cheated on each other after being together for longer than that.	EXPERT	How do you not see that?	What is wrong with you?	expert vs. novice	-1
cal8qq	personalfinance	"My wife had some blood work done with her cardiologist back in October of 2017.

I love my day job but it is stressful and I am finding myself thinking “I don’t want to go to work today” more and more as the weeks go by.

caw3km	AmItheAsshole	We’ve been friends for about 4 years. She’s a great woman and I love her but I’m also emotionally exhausted. She called me after the most recent incident, I told her I wasn’t in a good place mentally to be her emotional support system. She’s incredibly upset with me and our group of friends think I’m being cruel. Here’s the backstory, she’s been dating her boyfriend for 10+ years. They have 2 kids together. He cheats on her every few months. I can list at least 15 different women/incidents that he has cheated with in just the 4 years I’ve known her. That’s not an exaggeration and those are only the times she has definitive proof of. She won’t leave , she’s never going to leave. I try to be understanding but I’ve also told her I don’t understand why she stays, her response is always a different variation of “Men will be men” and that she loves him. I’ve always been there for her, usually she catches him late at night. Going through his phone while he sleeps. She’ll call me hysterically crying, I’ve always dropped what I’m doing and either talk to her on the phone for hours or go get her and talk in person. This drama typically goes on for 1-2 weeks of me basically being her on-call therapist. I feel as if I put in more effort to help her recover emotionally than he does.I’ve offered every bit of advice and resource I can possibly think of. At this point I’m exhausted. She is a sweet person and a good friend to me and I understand the hurt of being cheated on and I know leaving isn’t easy but I honestly just don’t want to hear about it anymore.

I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.​Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.​Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""Me: ""It's John.""​Ted: ""What?""​Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack.

I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""​His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""​Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.​Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back.

The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.​I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!""

We have managed to work it out until now, but I feel like something is absent. She will always talk about future plans, like moving in together and marriage.

I am not sure if I want the things she wants, or if I don’t want them with her. Another part of our relationship is that she does not really have anyone she is close with besides me. Her family is tough, and she spends most of her time with me. I am afraid if I leave her she will literally have no one. I guess what I am asking for advice on is: 1) is me not wanting the things she wants a red flag based on the stage we are in life and relationship (I am 21, she is 20). 2) how do I distinguish genuine love and care for someone compared to caring about them not being alone.

cd9tqr	Advice	"I originally posted this on AITA wondering if it would be wrong to flat out cut her from my life, but there were a few replies on other ways to go about our friendship so I figured I would ask you guys for your opinions.I was at my tennis club waiting for my  mate to get there one day so we could practice a bit, when he texted me  and said he couldn't make it. No big deal, there is normally someone  there I can have a hit with or at least sit and watch for a bit. No such  luck, the only person there was a 12 year old girl all by herself. This is weird because we don't have any junior teams but I figured why no  ask her for a hit. We got a talking a bit and I found out that she's  newish to our city and her parents just dropped her off there and left,  and she was just going to walk home whenever she wanted. This struck me  as unusual, but I did similar things at that age so it didn't ring too many alarm bells tbh.Eventually some other guys showed up and I introduced her as the lost child she  was and they joined us for a bit. After a few sets they wanted to go and  practice for real, and I don't have that much stamina so I was looking  to head off. I asked her if she had any friends she could play with  normally and she told she doesn't at school, she was just planning on  coming to the club and seeing who she could find. This is where I  suppose I made a risky judgment call and gave her my phone number and  said to text me if she ever wanted a hit.Fast forward a few months and I would consider us friends. We go out once a  week for a hit of tennis, she tells me about her life and me about mine.  I made some calls to my junior club and managed to get her signed up as  a fill-in for some teams, and even once got her dinner once because her  parents were off god knows where.This is the main point of contention. Her parents don't know I exist and  tbh, I don't know that they exist with 100% certainty, I've never seen them nor spoken to them. They are very much absent a lot of the time  (not abusive though, I've done all the phone calls and whatnot) and I  can tell it weighs heavily on her. This makes me extremely uncomfortable  as I am well aware of the implications of hanging out with a 12 year  old girl as a 19-20 dude. At the same time though, I'm her only friend  at the moment. I've done my best to help her make new friends her own  age and with similar interests, and at some point I feel like for both  of us it's best we part ways.I just want the best for her, she's extremely intelligent and capable and  I do legitimately care for her, and only being friends with a grown ass-dude is not the best thing for her. I just wonder if cutting her off  now would make me an asshole and do more harm than good. I have asked friends and they give me a  mixture of ""what are you waiting for"" and ""how could you even think  about it"". Maybe I should wait until she makes at least one other friend?"

I made some calls to my junior club and managed to get her signed up as  a fill-in for some teams, and even once got her dinner once because her  parents were off god knows where.This is the main point of contention. Her parents don't know I exist and  tbh, I don't know that they exist with 100% certainty, I've never seen them nor spoken to them. They are very much absent a lot of the time  (not abusive though, I've done all the phone calls and whatnot) and I  can tell it weighs heavily on her. This makes me extremely uncomfortable  as I am well aware of the implications of hanging out with a 12 year  old girl as a 19-20 dude. At the same time though, I'm her only friend  at the moment. I've done my best to help her make new friends her own  age and with similar interests, and at some point I feel like for both  of us it's best we part ways.I just want the best for her, she's extremely intelligent and capable and  I do legitimately care for her, and only being friends with a grown ass-dude is not the best thing for her. I just wonder if cutting her off  now would make me an asshole and do more harm than good. I have asked friends and they give me a  mixture of ""what are you waiting for"" and ""how could you even think  about it"". Maybe I should wait until she makes at least one other friend?"

cdkcm8	AmItheAsshole	I (23F) recently went to a dealership to get new wipers put on my car. I was there for all of 5 minutes while a guy who worked there (late 20s M) put the wipers on. We had a short, friendly conversation and then I paid and went on my way, thinking nothing of it. However, later that evening, I received a text from a number identifying himself as the guy from the dealership. He basically said he had a great time talking to me, and was hoping that we could meet up some time to talk again in the future. This made me really uncomfortable because I never gave him my phone number. He must have gotten it from my profile with the dealership. I feel like that’s a breech of privacy on his part, and if he wanted to shoot his shot he could’ve just done it while I was there in person. So WIBTA if I report him? I would have no doubt about it if he had made me uncomfortable during our irl interaction, but we had a pleasant conversation. I don’t want to get anybody in trouble, but it just really sits the wrong way with me that he has access to so many peoples information and is willing to use it in that way.

ce3499	AmItheAsshole	"Okay, hear me out.  I saw a similar story to mine on this subreddit and I decided to make a throwaway to talk about it.  Last summer we finished building a treehouse in our back yard for my 10 year old son to play it. One day he went up there with his friend and ran to me telling me ""our neighbor doesn't have any clothes on"".  Apparently our neighbor, whose family is friends with my family, was sunbathing without a top. I used to be close friends with her husband, but we've definitely drifted apart after this whole situation.   Anyway, this happened a few more times so I told my kid to stay out of the treehouse until I could talk to her.   I texted her husband (my friend) asking if they could text me before she bathes topless in her backyard so I could make sure my kid was inside or at least out of the treehouse.   Within an hour, she came storming to my house knocking on the front door. As soon as I opened it she was screaming at me to mind my business and to tell my ""perv kid"" to keep his eyes out of their yard.   In my opinion, she completely overreacted. I didn't push it further than this though. I just boarded up the window on the treehouse that faces her yard. It was a different story for my wife on the other hand. They ended up getting into a huge argument and are no longer friends. Eventually her husband started to ignore me as well and we haven't golfed or done anything together to this day.   I feel like thanks to me our entire friendship has been ruined. I wish I would've just said nothing and boarded the window up in the first place.  AITA?"

While my daughter is married and graduated college, she is not... mentally healthy. That's just the truth.She was a deeply disturbed child. Always unhappy, always on the edge of freaking out. I tried to help, but she never wanted to hear it. She displayed some distressing traits, but not regularly enough to get it reported. She could never focus on anything and still can't. I am shocked that none of the places she's lived in her adult life have ever burned down, because she frequently started fires as a child out of negligence.She has always rushed for substances to cope with anything unpleasant in life. As a teenager, I had a suspicion that she was abusing cough syrup, but was never able to prove it. She has always drank too much. I'm sorry, but when you're regularly drinking entire bottles of wine and daily need a shot of liquor to ""fall asleep"", you have a problem. But she was ""doing well in school"" and then ""had a good job"" so I wasn't able to comment. I know now that she's likely just a functional alcoholic. She's always flirted with Xanax, but was never given a regular prescription.She always wanted children.

I told her honestly that she needs to get herself and her partner in order before she should even think of getting pregnant and that a woman popping pills every day and washing it down with alcohol is in no way a fit parent.

cel7lr	AmItheAsshole	I always wanted one of each gender when I set out to have a kid. Our goal was to have three kids total, but I wanted at least one boy, one girl, could care less what the third would be. Our first two were boys. Then we had our third and ended up with another baby boy. Don’t get me wrong, I love all my sons. I wouldn’t trade them for the world or change them and make them girls. They’re amazing, wonderful kids and we are a happy family. I cannot stress that I love these little boys more than words can say. I also know that even if I had a girl, there’s a chance that she could identify as trans in the future (and I’d be 100% okay with that). Even so, there’s a part of me that just feels like there’s something missing. I know I’d feel the same if I had three girls and no boys.My husband and I were talking, now that our youngest is 3.5 years old. I said I really felt like I wanted a little girl. He said that he felt the same. However, we knew that even though we’d love and accept a fourth boy, we wanted to do what we could to have a girl. I had heard of a process to select the gender of your child through IVF and we’ve been looking into it. We also haven’t ruled out adoption, either. Nothing is official. We’re still in the looking stages and saving stages as well, as both of these things would be costly, but it would be worth it.I was telling my mother about this, as we are very close. At first I just mentioned that we were planning on having a fourth baby, either through pregnancy or adoption. She got very excited, until I mentioned that we wanted to make sure that we would have a girl. She got upset and said that she thought it was selfish. She said that my older two sons are old enough to understand why I want that and that I’m being selfish.

Strangely enough, we did receive a royalty check years ago for a hefty amount, $20,000 and would like to know if there is more we are entitled to.

When we spend nights together (up until last week, 5-6 nights a week) we spend them at his place because he has dogs and it's a closer commute to work for both of us. His commute is 5 minutes, mine is 10. Three weeks ago I switched jobs and now we both start work at 7 am (I can really walk in around 7:15 though). It used to be 8:30. I'm quick getting ready so I can be out the door in 20-30 minutes. This means I'd ideally wake up and shower at 6. My boyfriend though, wakes up at 5:40 and doesn't get out of the bathroom until 6:20. Every single day. That's fine. Not even an issue, still time for me to shower and get to work.Except. For whatever reason. And I will never be able to understand this. He doesn't shower until 6. Ever. Never ever. But he turns the freaking water on at 5:40 when he goes in the bathroom and let's it freaking run until 6 am. He uses the time to trim his beard (every freaking day), go pee, wake up, check his phone, whatever. Which not only is a tremendous waste of money and a fucking strain on the environment, but it means that my showers are ICE COLD. I've complained a billion times. He says that it's his routine and he's been doing it since way before he met me. He basically said that if I don't like it, wake up and take a shower before him. Which would mean waking up a full hour earlier than necessary considering there is plenty of time to get ready after him. I complained about it for two weeks, then woke up one week ago today and checked for hot water and it made me so mad that he'd done it again that I told him that I'll no longer be spending the weekdays with him because I'm not going to continue to inconvenience myself and start every morning off of a bad note with an ice cold shower over something that could easily be fixed. I offered to spend Friday and Saturday evenings with him, but have made it clear I'm going home every Sunday afternoon. For a week I've stuck to this. He texted me this morning telling me that he's looking forward to seeing me today but that he thinks I'm being very overdramatic about the situation and need to get over it before I ruin our relationship over something ""so stupid"".

I complained about it for two weeks, then woke up one week ago today and checked for hot water and it made me so mad that he'd done it again that I told him that I'll no longer be spending the weekdays with him because I'm not going to continue to inconvenience myself and start every morning off of a bad note with an ice cold shower over something that could easily be fixed. I offered to spend Friday and Saturday evenings with him, but have made it clear I'm going home every Sunday afternoon. For a week I've stuck to this. He texted me this morning telling me that he's looking forward to seeing me today but that he thinks I'm being very overdramatic about the situation and need to get over it before I ruin our relationship over something ""so stupid"". So he thinks it's my fault. I plan to spend tonight and tomorrow with him and go home on Sunday just like I did this week. AITA?Tl;dr: I refused to stay with my boyfriend until he stops wasting all of the hot water in the morning. AITA?"	LOC	Are you dating a literal person?	How long have you guys been dating?

ciw8o4	AmItheAsshole	I work at a summer camp where you drop your children off in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon after your work. The camp is funded from the state so the parents have to pay only about 30 USD per week while we take care of their children. It is an IT camp, children from 6-15 are taught how to work with 3D printers, build and code lego robots, make youtube videos, use computers, etc. It was required that the children have some sort of relationship to these kind of things or at least take interest in them. On wednesday we had a new kid show up because he was sick the first two days of the camp. His mother told me how he's only 6 but he's clever as a 9 year old at least. Also she told me how great he is with technology and how awesome his lego building skills are. I believed her and was very happy that we have such a kid. So I take him to the classroom and show him his computer. That's when he tells me that he doesn't know how to read and has never been on a computer, smarthphone or a tablet - basically everything this camp is about. Well, I gave him some lego robots which he could build. He came to me every 2 minutes saying that it's too hard and he can't do that. So basically there was nothing for him to do for the whole week. Later when I talked to the owner of the camp he told me that the mother signed him up for two weeks and he allowed it after she told him her lies. I was really pissed at the kid's mother for abusing the price of the camp and using it as a really cheap daycare. Me and the girl who works there with me persuaded the owner to kick the kid from the camp for the next week because there was nothing for him to do and his mother was lying about his skills.  Now my friend and my girlfriend think that I'm an asshole for this but In my opinion work with children is really exhausting and I can't give all my attention to this kid. So AITA?   tldr; Mother lied about her kid being a second coming of Albert Einstein to get him to IT summer camp. We found out he can't even read and has never used a PC. We kicked him from the next week of the camp.	LOC	As a process around how to address skills mismatch?	Do you have a degree in education?	US vs. non-US	-1

cj19fa	AmItheAsshole	Hi, all! I’m (26F) struggling with a gym issue. I joined a gym 2 months ago and after a gym staff member became friendly with me. He has been inviting me to come to the gym near closing so we can work out together after closing to be workout buddies. I declined because I don’t want to work out alone at night with someone I don’t know and I like to workout alone. Each time, I’ve been more and more uncomfortable because he watches me workout until it looks like I’m free to talk. I politely asked him to leave me alone during workouts so he started stopping me at the door on my way out.  2 days ago, he asked me if I would be interested in joining him for lunch so we could get to know each other better. I told him I’m married but could get lunch as a friend. His face turned red and he accused me of lying because I wasn’t wearing a ring. I explained to him that my husband and I don’t wear one because we think the money is spent better elsewhere and I never mentioned I am married because it was never relevant to the conversation. He started to go on this rant about how he just knew I was the perfect woman for him and if I gave him a chance I’d also realize that. I repeated that I am happily married to X (his name is clearly Asian). He claimed as a white man he could make me happier than my Asian husband.That’s when I lost it. I am Asian and received plenty of “me love you long time” shit from all types of men all my life. Not only that, I am angry this man insulted my husband and our race. I called him a racist creep and I’d never even consider dating someone like him and I was sure his d*ck must be withered from all the steroids he’s been on to build his swollen body puffs. He walked away after that, and some other members told me I’d crossed a line. Only one person told me he could understand my anger. I’ve also been banned from the gym for being inappropriate and body-shaming (which also makes me think I may have taken it too far by what I said and I am horrified I have body-shamed someone).My husband is fully supportive of me putting in a complaint. A friend of ours told me it was harmless and the guy probably just thought I was attractive but didn’t handle rejection well and my words were hurtful to my friend (“someone like you”) because they could be confused for refusing to date a white man due race. Well, this also upset me because I don’t think our friend understands and took an unrelated situation and applied it to himself (he is a white man married to an Asian woman). He asked me to post this for judgement.AITA for insulting the gym staff member? WIBTA for reporting his previous behavior now that I’ve been banned?Thank you, I will be so appreciative of any comments.	LOC	People said you crossed a line after all that?

cjpin4	AmItheAsshole	To give some context: I broke up with my ex-husband about 4 years ago, things were pretty hostile for several years but have been better for the last 6 months. Before this event we were able to talk like grown ups, mostly. We have a boy together, He is 6.It all started about a month ago, I enjoy going to McDonald's for breakfast. When I don't have my son I go once a week before work, because that is the only time I can go. Well I have started taking him with me for breakfast once a week before dropping him off at school when he's under my care. He always gets what he would normally get, a burger, fries and a frozen coke. The problem is my ex completely exploded over this when I picked him up, He said it's completely irresponsible to be taking him for fast food for breakfast, and that he is complaining and refuses to eat the crappy food my husband serves him for breakfast, and only wants McDonald's. He thinks I don't care about his health at all either.We both ended up completely screaming at each other in a car park over this. I'm so sick of dealing with my ex. I don't see how this is an issue, it's once a week, it's not my fault he gives him yuck food for breakfast and he doesn't want to eat it.	TIME	He shouldn’t be giving him yucky food?

However, I am experiencing some sort of corruption from landlords that are charging my roommates and I full month's rent for a month that the lease ends in the middle of the month (14th of AUG). My roommates are simply bending over and accepting this, however, I believe that there is something we should be able to do, given the fact that we are simply not staying for the full duration of the month.

Please read the story after the question for context; thanks for the legal advice.For those familiar with the Philippine laws, is there a Republic Act that states that all companies and owners of arcade game cabinets (e.g. World of Fun, Quantum Amusement, Tom's World) are required to maintain the cabinets to be updated (to the latest versions) and maintained constantly for the customers?Here's why. There is a branch of World of Fun amusement arcade in a Walter Mart mall where they have a Pump It Up Fiesta EX machine (which is already old \[8 years to be exact from this post\], because there were like 5 versions newer than this, with the newest being Pump It Up XX \[20th Anniversary Edition\]). In the last 2-3 years, the P1 and P2 pads in the cabinet were malfunctioning - with P1 pad with some or all of the buttons not working or squishy, and P2 pad either shaky when using the bar or the back buttons not working consistently. The worst part is that in those the cabinet is still there today with little to no repair, and with NO update at all; I played there every once in a while to see if the pads would be fixed at least - but they did not, which is frustrating for avid players.I brought this problem up to the branch's maintenance crew, and despite them promising to repair the pads or to upgrade the game to the newest version, they did little or nothing at all to alleviate the problem. In my opinion, they could have just pulled out the game altogether, sold the cabinet and saved tons of money so that they can either buy a new PIU game or fix the other arcade games (there are others not working as well).

cpvoug	personalfinance	Dear redditorsSo I am in a bit if regret, up until last week i never regretted buying my car. I was very happy that I will pay it off soon and be done with the monthly payment. I make 75k a year so and I live rent free, so making a $871 a month wasnt bad. I have always saw houses as good investment, so recently i saw a really house that was going on sale and I was 100% into it once I saw it duing open house. I really want to take out a mortgage and buy it (listed for 250k). I was doing the math and mortgage calculators online I relized that my high monthly payment on the car is literally stopping me from affording it. I have a pretty good credit score (750) My first thought was to call my bank and ask if I can refinance the car to lower the car payment but reading online, people have said that taking a new loan is just going to damage your credit score and you may not even be able to get 250k from a lender.

cri9nw	AmItheAsshole	I have a pretty decent paying job, he lost his job at McDonald’s back in early May. We have a mortgage to pay, bills, groceries, and all that normal stuff. I’ve also paid his credit card bill, traffic ticket, and put money into his overdrawn checking account. I’ve been the only one financially supporting us since he lost his job and it’s been really really stressful, especially since I detest my job and am miserable at it but I can’t afford to find a new one and take the pay cut right now.Money was becoming increasingly tight as time went on. He applied for unemployment a few weeks ago finally, but still hasn’t gotten any money from them. And he just got a job offer from the one place he applied to and starts in September.The main issue/fight:This guy is addicted to his energy drinks, he’ll have 4-6 per day and buys them two at a time from the gas station. He would just take my card from my wallet and my car without asking and go buy some and/or snacks. It got to the point where that was too much and I asked him (multiple times) to stop. I couldn’t afford it. Couldn’t even afford the gas he was using. I had to start hiding my wallet from him.Now he will be starting a new job soon, he’ll still get the backpay from those few weeks of unemployment whenever it goes through, and I was forced to work a buttload of overtime at my shitty job this past couple weeks and will be getting a pretty hefty paycheck next Friday.I’ve been really extra depressed lately, mostly due to the financial stress and hating my job, so I bought a PC game ($30) on my CREDIT CARD to give me something to keep my mind off things. Then I MENTIONED to him that I wanted to buy a cheap new PC because right now I just have a shitty old laptop. I’ve been setting aside $20-40 per paycheck for a few months to save up to eventually assist him in buying my engagement ring. I have $300 from that already, and I’d need $130 more out of my checking account to purchase all the computer parts. And again, I haven’t bought it yet, I was asking what he thought about it.His response was salty as fuck and he bitched me out for wanting to spend MY money on ME (now that I can finally afford to) but not wanting to give him $15 every single day for energy drinks anymore.. when all he’s been doing is staying at home and sleeping all day. And he said “just don’t expect me to ever spend another cent on you... except for the bills and your engagement ring whenever that happens.” I countered with “don’t even bother” and left for work.AITA?

ctvpr0	legaladvice	Posting for my brother. He lives in Texas. Recently, he was involved in an accident and the insurance company declared his vehicle (2007 Lincoln Navigator L Ultimate) a total loss. In case it matters, he was hit by another drive, but because the other driver lied to police, the police listed my brother at fault.Based on NADA/KBB/local comps, his vehicle was worth between $10,000 - $11,000, but the insurance company is only offering him $7,100. They’re using non-L (L is the designation for physically longer versions; he has 6 kids and can’t fit everyone in the standard size SUV) versions of his vehicle with fewer options as the basis for their valuation.After my brother emailed the adjuster back with the details that his vehicle is an L version, and a laundry list of options that his Navigator had that the insurance company’s comps did not have, they insist that the payout for his total is $7,100. One of the reasons they cite is that the payout is “the lesser” of either 1) what it costs to repair the vehicle or 2) what it costs to replace it. It would cost less to repair, so they insist they can only give him the repair amount.I know insurance companies are highly regulated, but he’s getting nowhere at this point.

cu2eyk	AmItheAsshole	"I met my boyfriend (2+ years) through his best friend, \*Andy, who was also a close friend of mine.  Andy is dating \*Becky.  Once when I was with my boyfriend, Andy called and I -- completely unintentionally -- overheard Andy say that he had cheated on Becky with his ex.  My boyfriend and I exchanged a glance about this.  Andy talks about his ex a lot and admits he has feelings for her.  I've been cheated on several times, and hearing that a close friend did this to someone I knew and liked admittedly upset and disappointed me.Becky is much younger than Andy and I.  In addition to the cheating, I feel that Andy is kind of a dick to her: for example, after just a couple of weeks of dating and her spending several nights, he started demanding that she pay rent and split groceries that he would buy.  She capitulated, even though Becky still has her own place, and they still do their grocery shopping separately, etc.  So, sometime in February, Becky and I start chatting on Facebook and I end the conversation with a lot of supportive generalities: ""You are so smart and beautiful.  Andy can be a dick sometimes.  You shouldn't feel insecure or think that anyone has the right to push you around.""  That kind of thing.  She thanks me effusively for being so encouraging and nice, and that's it. Months pass, and I learn that Becky has accused Andy of cheating on her, alleging that she found out because I had drunk dialed her in the beginning of May.  My boyfriend and Andy are furious at me.  However, Becky's story is conclusively not true: 1- I was out of the country, backpacking with my parents, both teetotalers, at the alleged time of the call, so I was definitely not out drinking or making weird international calls; 2- I have never had Becky's phone number; and 3- My boyfriend, at my insistence, looked at my phone records on the Verizon site during this time and was able to see that I didn't call Becky (he knows her number).   I honestly wish I'd told her about the cheating, but it seems like she's been suspicious of Andy and used me as the fall person. Andy has blocked me completely, he's poisoning our friend group, and my boyfriend -- who now believes my version of events -- refuses to give Andy my side.

cubq3j	AmItheAsshole	The setup: I’ve known this guy for a couple years and we’ve worked together occasionally. We’ve had a couple dates before. We split the bill without any discussion or issue. He Snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. I say sure.I forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied “pizza and a movie” and he replied “yeah see you soon!” It was just an innocent phrase but I didn’t eat that day and assumed we’d get food together.I show up and he has the movie. I say “so are we getting food?” He says “I already ate. But I’m sure you have apps on your phone if you want something.” Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.I sit there awkwardly. This guy previously talked about being a men’s rights guy. A normal one, not an incel dickhead. He also mentioned he’s low on cash. But isn’t it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? If he was too broke I’d obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn’t the vibe I got since he bragged about a new game he bought. He returns and turns on the TV and turns off all the lights. Then he goes into the kitchen, which I assume is to get alcohol. I call out casually “what do you got to drink?” He calls back “Do you like tap water?”This is not some red pill bullshit. I know this guy, he’s serious. There’s nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. I call out, “Yeah, sure.”He brings me back a glass of tap water. He winks at me.I’m starving. I haven’t eaten since 8am. I say “Hey, I don’t wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza.” He says in a sympathetic tone, “Oh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn’t clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.”This is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn’t offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. After the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he’s weird with money and I’m uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn’t think my pizza was his responsibility. Then he asks me to have sex with him.I decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.I don’t expect or need people to buy me things, but I think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners.

cv9lxs	AmItheAsshole	"So let me preface this, I don't agree with what happened as I believe recreational use of marijuana should be legal. I've been living at my current complex for about a year, it's a very small complex where everyone is cramped up together.

I've initially left messages asking them to try to filter it better or at least do it somewhere else. We don't have windows we can open, so there's no way them or I can let it out.After still dealing with it for a month, I spoke to management and all they did was say ""no smoking on premises"" in an email.Smells persisted.Now I have family come by alot, and I do my best to give good impressions....but with the constant smell they don't want to visit anymore since they think the complex is full of druggies.So I did the unthinkable, I filed a complaint with police on kids smoking weed. They stopped by, and essentially did a sweep of the complex. Note, this IS NOT what I requested. I just wanted them to tell the kids to do it elsewhere or just stop smoking in the complex.They busted two different tennants, one was in the process of lighting some up and apparently had a personal bag big enough to be considered distributable.The second Tennant was actively dealing from what I overheard, he was busted with a few bricks but did not actively smoke.AITA for essentially ruining these people's lives all because of a bad smell?

We don't have windows we can open, so there's no way them or I can let it out.After still dealing with it for a month, I spoke to management and all they did was say ""no smoking on premises"" in an email.Smells persisted.Now I have family come by alot, and I do my best to give good impressions....but with the constant smell they don't want to visit anymore since they think the complex is full of druggies.So I did the unthinkable, I filed a complaint with police on kids smoking weed. They stopped by, and essentially did a sweep of the complex. Note, this IS NOT what I requested. I just wanted them to tell the kids to do it elsewhere or just stop smoking in the complex.They busted two different tennants, one was in the process of lighting some up and apparently had a personal bag big enough to be considered distributable.The second Tennant was actively dealing from what I overheard, he was busted with a few bricks but did not actively smoke.AITA for essentially ruining these people's lives all because of a bad smell? I tried to tell the officers I didn't want them arrested, just to be spoken to to stop or go elsewhere to do it."	TIME	How do you know it was a bad smell?

cvqmp6	personalfinance	This may be anecdotal, but it felt worth mentioning. I went to a popular chain for a $57 new patient exam, cleaning, and x-rays. They found multiple cavities and I spent $600 on getting them fixed. I could only afford to do half of them at once, and was going to come back to finish on another day. In the mean time, I got a new job that offered dental insurance. So I went to a private dentist office instead to finish up the work. They said I had zero cavities or problem teeth. I went to a second office just to be safe, and they said the same thing. It seems pretty scammy to me. Just be careful.	TIME	How is this scammy?

This is the daughter writing the update. My mom didn’t know how to do an update post and asked me to write it for her. We’re both here to respond to comments if you have any.I saw that a few people asked what my aunt’s opinion was after the verdict was given on this post! Here is the answer to that question: My aunt said that she had told my cousin from the beginning that excluding me was going to hurt my feelings and suggested to her that I be a bridesmaid instead of my mother. My cousin turned down this suggestion but would not say why. I also saw some people wondering if something had gone down between my cousin and me that I wasn’t telling my mom. This is definitely valid question! The answer is no, she and I haven’t had any problems prior to this (that I know of, at least). She has always been like a sister to me. If she ever had a problem with me or anything I’ve done I would hope she would tell me.Another question I saw was about my relationship with my father. He and I have a very tense relationship due largely to some mental heath problems that he has. Prior to all of this I had confided in my cousin a lot about this. This made her decision to include him over me hurtful in a very poignant way.After reading all of your comments and some more deliberation, my mom ended up staying in the wedding party. I appreciate her desire to stand up for me but I really did want my cousin’s wedding to go smoothly (despite my feelings being very hurt). My mom respected my wishes. She is an amazing mom all around and I am lucky to have her in my corner. After the conversation I had with my cousin (described in the last post) I was on the fence about attending the wedding. I then heard from other relatives that she was concerned that I would “sabotage the wedding” if I were to attend. I found this comment to be bizarre and confusing. At this point I decided that it would be best to remove myself from the situation entirely. I told her that I wouldn’t be attending and left it at that. It was a hard decision to make, but your reactions to the original post made me feel more confident in my choice.The wedding did end up going smoothly. I heard from multiple sources that there was plenty of extra room in the bridal suite. I wish I could have been there with my family to support her on her big day. She and I have both been part of each other’s major life milestones for as long as I can remember. I still haven’t figured out why I was the only one excluded but I have come to the conclusion that she and I must not be as close as I had always thought we were. At this point I’m not sure that I want to be. Your feedback on the original post played a large part in me realizing that.Thanks to everyone for reading and for all of your responses!

cz4z9j	AmItheAsshole	My dad has two small companies, one is selling/laying tiles and the other one is room rental.I started working in the first one about a year ago when I got out of school. He had a woman doing all the management for the second one but after a huge argument she left and I had to replace her (FYI, I don't have any training in that field at all). So for the past 6 months I am in charge of everything. Sales, marketing, customer service and managing the rooms. I'm his only office worker (he is responsible for the construction sites) and having to manage two companies at a time has been very stressful in the last few months. As you can imagine, when you have so many things to keep an eye on you tend to make some mistakes. And when I make them, even if they're little, I get absolutely destroyed with words. I'm not saying he's an asshole for yelling at me because let's face it, almost every boss is strict, that's how the world works and I'm not expecting to have a nice and understanding boss in my next job. Still, being called an idiot is not fun, especially when you're doing your best to keep your fathers company afloat.Now here's the thing, as a father he is actually great, he was always there for me, even after losing custody over 10 years ago when my parents divorced. You could say maybe he is doing all the yelling and inducing stress to help me become a man, and I respect that. But I can only endure it this much, I'm fresh out of school after all.He never tells me this personally but what I've heard is that he always talks about how he couldn't keep going without me, that he had to close the company if I were to quit suddenly. That's why I've already told him that I will probably quit soon and that he should start looking for someone to replace me, but so far he has not made an effort to look for new employees.I can't keep up this level of stress much longer, It's making me physically and emotionally weak. Selling tiles is something I could imagine doing, but I absolutely hate the other job. WIBTA if I quit the job, risking the company?TL;DR: Working 2 jobs at a time with maximum responsibility and high stress. Thinking about quitting it, meaning the company could go bankrupt.

czaetj	AmItheAsshole	So I recently saw a post that described an issue similar to the one my girlfriend and I are having right now, so I figured I'd share.For context, I'm a guy who tries my best to keep it pretty clean. Thankfully I'm not naturally very hairy, and regularly shave my arms, legs, chest, and armpits (partly due to personal preference, and partly the result of habits I developed when I swam in college).I also just cannot stand body hair on women. Sorry if that statement makes me an asshole, but I just can't get over it. Yes I understand women can do what they want with their bodies, and I respect their decision if they choose not to shave. But no amount of posturing is going to sway me on this one (and I think most guys would admit to feeling the same if you put a gun to their head). So I feel that if I keep myself clean shaven, I'd have more of a leg to stand on if I were to ask a woman to do the same. Anywho my girlfriend and I have recently arrived at that stage where we are living together and are comfortable being disgusting around each other (shitting while the other's brushing their teeth, etc.). She's also stopped shaving her armpits as frequently, which has really gotten on my nerves. I politely told her that this is an issue for me, and asked if she would shave more often. She replied by saying that it's 2019, and that women shouldn't be stigmatized for having body hair. Yea I suppose she's right, but it still bothers me, so I am refusing to shave my ass/around my asshole until she relents, which has in turn really gotten on her nerves. She thinks I'm an asshole, but I'm merely trying to get her to see things from my perspective.

czn08t	AmItheAsshole	My ex and I were high school sweethearts and we were together for around 6 years.

Weddings are hard enough when you're single and I really just wanted to celebrate and enjoy my friend's wedding in peace. I didn't want to stress about running into my ex and his new wife all night. They understood and they did not invite my ex to their wedding. Recently I was hanging out with some friends and my ex got brought up and someone asked why he missed the wedding. The bride explained he wasn't invited because of me. I saw some of the other people exchange glances with each other like it was weird. But no one actually said anything to me.One of my best friend is getting married at the end of the year on NYE and I'm a bridesmaid and I asked her to not invite my ex to her wedding for the same reasons. They haven't sent out invitations yet but as far as I know he will not be invited.I feel like since I'm in the wedding party it's not unfair of me to ask my friends for this favor so I don't feel uncomfortable.

We were both a little drunk and I though this could be a good moment because I wanted to hear opinion about that from someone close to me for a long time now.

d0rwl9	AmItheAsshole	My friend and I both have a moderately dark/edgy sense of humor, and often joke around when we're hanging out. We have a handful of youtubers we both like who make similarly edgy jokes as well, and we often reference stuff we found funny from their videos, mostly just because it makes us laugh.My friend shares an apartment with a good friend of his and said friend's girlfriend of several years. I've never gotten into it with either of them before, we're not particularly close but have generally had a decently friendly relationship. The other week we were hanging out at his place, and naturally, some edgy jokes came up, nothing out of the ordinary for us.Generally whenever I'm hanging out at his place, both his roommates are out of the house, so we normally don't have to worry about bothering them, but his friend's GF happened to be in the house for part of the time I was over. We tried to keep things a bit quieter so as not to bother her, but apparently she overheard a few jokes we said from the other room, and got pretty upset, though we didn't find out about this until later.None of the jokes we make are intentionally mean-spirited, everything's all generally good natured.

d0rwl9	AmItheAsshole	My friend and I both have a moderately dark/edgy sense of humor, and often joke around when we're hanging out. We have a handful of youtubers we both like who make similarly edgy jokes as well, and we often reference stuff we found funny from their videos, mostly just because it makes us laugh.My friend shares an apartment with a good friend of his and said friend's girlfriend of several years. I've never gotten into it with either of them before, we're not particularly close but have generally had a decently friendly relationship. The other week we were hanging out at his place, and naturally, some edgy jokes came up, nothing out of the ordinary for us.Generally whenever I'm hanging out at his place, both his roommates are out of the house, so we normally don't have to worry about bothering them, but his friend's GF happened to be in the house for part of the time I was over. We tried to keep things a bit quieter so as not to bother her, but apparently she overheard a few jokes we said from the other room, and got pretty upset, though we didn't find out about this until later.None of the jokes we make are intentionally mean-spirited, everything's all generally good natured.

d1btlg	AmItheAsshole	I’m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don’t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I’m assuming my dad has told her I’m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I’m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. I just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I’m justified in saying no.

To start with a little context; all my life I've thought of my father as a kind, hard working and honest man that wanted nothing for the best for his family. Unfortunately my perception of him has changed recently though a part of me still believes this. My older brother has always had problems with our dad. Various different things over the years some my brothers fault and some dads. I never really understood. It was only until the last year or so where my brother (26) had really started hating dad even disowning him as a   father which broke dad's heart. I'd always be on dads side as I didn't fully understand why my brother would overreact like that. My brother won't ever speak to him again as he is known to hold a grudge. It's only now I know the reason but I'm getting there. Dad and mum split up 10 years ago and about 6 months after that Mum moved in with a new boyfriend. They were technically still married. One night Dad showed up to their place (boyfriend wasnt home) and proceeded to rape my Mother. I had no idea what happened at the time as I was 9 but my brother was the one who told me this recently. How he found is complicated. I straight up did not believe him at the time and thought he was making stupid and wild accusations out of his hate for dad. I was completely convinced my own father would be incapable of doing something like this as I thought him as the most honorable and loving man. In some respects he still is and has always been a great father to his sons which make this more difficult for me. I live with Mum these days and Dad lives a few hours drive a way. Before this I kept in contact with him. Anyways I asked mum next to hear the truth. I know I shouldn't have brought the memory back up with her but I needed to know. She confirms it did happen as in her words ""he felt it was his given right"" because they were still married. I said it's no ones right to rape anyone. I was so angry. Keep In mind this happened 10 years ago and they still spoke afterwards. She just accepted it and moved on with her life after and I can't fault her for that. I haven't dealt with dad yet and he's been trying to call me as I haven't spoken to him in a while. I'm scared to face him. He doesn't know I know and mum said to just leave it. How can I but?

d2fq6q	AmItheAsshole	I feel pretty comfortable with it but some recent posts in r/insaneparents have me questioning myself. Backstory: I have three teenagers and they are all GOOD. Like, they talk to me, don’t lie or sneak etc. (that I know of, of course, but I’m pretty sure). We have very open relationships, they are good students, have jobs, talk to me if they are going to a party where people are drinking etc and never ever drive under the influence. I have a full time job and sometimes we don’t connect until nighttime. So. I love having them on location services for a couple of reasons. First of all, i don’t want to be a helicopter parent who says “where are you” all the time. A quick check lets me know my son is at work or my daughter is at a friend’s house and then I don’t bother them. No calls or texts, all is well. I also think about how fast we move around and if something bad happened I’d be able to find them ASAP. One of my kids was in a car accident and I was able to get there immediately without having to ask for directions. Another kid went off to college and it gives me so much pleasure to see him in another city without getting in his face and asking what he’s doing. It makes me feel connected without bothering him. That said, a lot of people are saying this is a huge invasion of privacy for a young adult. None of my kids seems to mind (maybe because it makes me call them less?) but people online seem to think it’s horrible. so... AITA?	TIME	Would you have been ok with this when you were their age?

d4grrh	AmItheAsshole	live with my best friend and his girlfriend in a 2 bedroom apartment.Everything has always been smooth and our arrangement works out fine for the most part, everyone split rent evenly. We have 2 bathrooms so one they use in their room and I took over the other one.Last night it was my turn to do laundry and I needed to switch everything over but my boy’s gf still had clothes in the dryer. She was at work and forgot so she texted me if I can just dump her clothes on top of the dryer and she will take care of it later.I had no problem with this but when I started taking her clothes out I saw these button pad things in there. I was kinda weirded out because they looked like diapers so when she got home I asked her what those are for.She told me they are washable pads. Like for her period. I wasn’t mean or tried to be rude but I asked her if she’s seriously washing used bloody pads in our communal laundry. She said yes. I was honest and told her that’s a little gross and that I thought pads were meant to be disposable for a reason. She got upset and said there’s no reason why she shouldn’t wash them with the rest of her clothes and if I expected her to go to a laundromat. I told her no of course not but maybe to hand wash them next time in her bathroom.She told her bf about it and he said I crossed a line and to apologize. Just to keep the peace I did but she’s been giving me attitude since. I don’t think it was unreasonable to ask her to just clean them in her bathroom because they are essentially covered in blood. I would never ask her to pay money or make a trip to go to the laundromat but at least wash private things like that in private. I’ve always been uncomfortable with blood and it makes me uneasy.

Just to keep the peace I did but she’s been giving me attitude since. I don’t think it was unreasonable to ask her to just clean them in her bathroom because they are essentially covered in blood. I would never ask her to pay money or make a trip to go to the laundromat but at least wash private things like that in private. I’ve always been uncomfortable with blood and it makes me uneasy. We all pay rent and I would never do something that made her uncomfortable	LOC	Do you realise how gross that sounds?	YTA - why do you even need to ask?	US vs. non-US	-1
d59br7	AmItheAsshole	I (22f) and my friend (21f) recently booked an Airbnb apartment for a week long holiday to the beach. We both brought along our boyfriends, who we have both been with for around 3 years. We talk often about sex, what we're up to, issues if we have any, just normal girl stuff. I've confided in her before that me and my boyfriend don't really have sex anymore because of work and he's on antidepressants, and it really gets me down. The last time I told her about this was a couple of months ago. She often tells me little funny things that happened while she was having sex, and if anything happens to me, I tell her too. When we went on holiday, I assumed that she wouldn't be having sex with her partner.  My boyfriend has always made it clear he finds it weird to have sex in hotels/not his own house or mine, and he was my first partner so I assumed it was a normal view. I have to admit, I also didn't want to risk hearing her have sex because I'm really insecure that I'm not, and also because, to be honest, I feel like my relationship is going downhill and I'm jealous that after the same amount of time, her relationship is near perfect (from her own words). I think it's normal for relationships to not be as exciting and sexy as they were at the start and I honestly think that because hers seems to be, they're probably forcing it or actually unhappy. Anyway, the first night we were away I went downstairs for a glass of water (their room was ground floor, ours first) and I heard quiet moans from their room. I was immediately super pissed. I had tried it on with my bf in the shower earlier (I thought he would be ok with that because the mess would just wash away) but it hadn't worked. Without really thinking I opened the door and told them to shut the fuck up. She immediately looked horrified and covered up, and said they weren't being loud. I rolled my eyes and said that it was 'gross, disrespectful to me, and honestly just weird' and then went to bed. Things are not the same after this but I can't believe she would do something like that. AITA?	LOC	What do you think parents are planning when they go on trips away from their kids?

d5sbd2	Advice	 I'm adopted, was adopted at birth, my adopted parents are great, my whole family is smart and great. My 'sister' is their biological niece they adopted. She was adopted at 13 because her father abused her physically, sexually, mentally, and we were legally unable to look into her locked file at DCYF. let's just say her father was known as the town psycho. Her mother was mentally retarded and didn't date my father, who was in love with her. He married her sister instead aka my adopted Mom. How ever, my sister looks so much like her bio Mon that she could be her twin. And said sister has ruined our family relationship. She called mom sobbing that our kissed her on the lips, reported how he groped her, would pull her into his lap when she watched cartoons with him. And he said he would fuck her if given the chance. She made it so he couldn't hug her and caused stressed in the family. Yes it's true he did it but to tell others is slanderShe then at age 20, ran away, packed her jeep and found a home. Now, while we're dealing with my dad now with cancer, she's going on trips to Florida, Japan, Korea and blocked us on everything. We don't even know where she lives. She also went to the psych ward cause of stuff. Dad treats me differently than her cause I was adopted at birth.

d5yy1d	legaladvice	So before I was going to put in my 2 weeks at my old company I went on vacation to use up my hours because they won't cash it out do to policy. I took off August 19th through the 27th because I had about 60 hours so I only used 56. When I got back on the 28th I put in my 2 weeks and the next day I get a call from HR saying they're shortening my resignation notice and that they over paid me hundreds of dollars because I took too much time off. I asked how do you have negative vacation hours and if that was possible, why was my vacation approved? They said they would look into it and I never heard back. I called and got ahold of HR because I didn't receive my last check for my vacation plus the one day I worked before they basically fired me. She was asking why I was expecting a check for last Friday the 13th and when I kept asking for documentation on the vacation policy and every time I used my hours she would deflect staying that another member went over this with me on the phone. I had to ask 3 times for it in written form and it had the feel that they didn't want to give me that information.  So would I have a case?

d8yjen	pcmasterrace	Just a few weeks ago I had an ROG STRIX 1070Ti die on me, kinda sucked but I just assumed it would be a good time to upgrade seen as it died and so I upgraded. However, I'd hoped I could RMA the 1070Ti to get a repair or replacement as the card is well within their 36 month warranty period and using it for another build or backup would be great.So I contacted ASUS, they referred me to the Australian RMA/Service centre and I proceeded with the RMA, even happily paying shipping. They got back to me within a few days saying repairs are done and it's been shipped, awesome! Come the day the GPU arrives at my doorstep and to my surprise, it's still broken! So here I'm trying to explain to ASUS that it's still broken, and the only option I have is to pay shipping a second time for them to check for problems again? Is this standard, that the customer pays a shipping fee twice to get a repaired product? Once I understand, but twice? Surely not.

d9m02m	AmItheAsshole	About two months ago, my husband and I got “married” in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it’s their only daughter’s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn’t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he “proposed” (something I didn’t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren’t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn’t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I’ll call her Carol) and I aren’t close. She’s fine enough in low doses, but...We’re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must’ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a “gift grab” (our wedding website stated that someone’s presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband’s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I’ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes.

dh9dfp	AmItheAsshole	My boyfriend and I [both 25M] have been dating for almost a decade. For the most part, our relationship is pretty great. But my boyfriend is a very sensitive person and has a lot of emotional baggage. He’s had a bit of a difficult life and can get spun out over minor inconveniences pretty easily. This is not usually in a toxic “taking it out on me/others” kind of way; more so he becomes too upset to function normally and needs a lot of support/comfort. This especially happens in the Fall, since he’s experienced a lot of loss around this time of year and tends to be a bit fragile.Every year, he visits his grandfather’s grave on what would have been his grandfather’s birthday. The grandfather passed when we were in high school (so about 7 years ago) and I attended the funeral at the time. Several years have passed, but they were close so my boyfriend always tends to get pretty upset around this time of year.Skipping forward to this week, my boyfriend had a very bad day at work and was spinning out about how he hates this time of year and how he was upset. As usual, I was giving him an outlet and trying to cheer him up. While doing so, he asked if I would visit his grandfather’s grave with him and his mother this weekend. As mentioned earlier, I had attended the funeral 7 years prior. But I had never gone to (nor been asked to) go to the grave with him before.I told him him that I would prefer not to visit the grave with him and that doing so would make me uncomfortable. He asked me to clarify, so I explained I’m not a big fan of cemeteries (not that I’m creeped out by them, but just being there makes me uncomfortable and I feel no connection to the deceased by being there) and that I don’t even go to my own deceased family’s graves.

dh9dfp	AmItheAsshole	My boyfriend and I [both 25M] have been dating for almost a decade. For the most part, our relationship is pretty great. But my boyfriend is a very sensitive person and has a lot of emotional baggage. He’s had a bit of a difficult life and can get spun out over minor inconveniences pretty easily. This is not usually in a toxic “taking it out on me/others” kind of way; more so he becomes too upset to function normally and needs a lot of support/comfort. This especially happens in the Fall, since he’s experienced a lot of loss around this time of year and tends to be a bit fragile.Every year, he visits his grandfather’s grave on what would have been his grandfather’s birthday. The grandfather passed when we were in high school (so about 7 years ago) and I attended the funeral at the time. Several years have passed, but they were close so my boyfriend always tends to get pretty upset around this time of year.Skipping forward to this week, my boyfriend had a very bad day at work and was spinning out about how he hates this time of year and how he was upset. As usual, I was giving him an outlet and trying to cheer him up. While doing so, he asked if I would visit his grandfather’s grave with him and his mother this weekend. As mentioned earlier, I had attended the funeral 7 years prior. But I had never gone to (nor been asked to) go to the grave with him before.I told him him that I would prefer not to visit the grave with him and that doing so would make me uncomfortable. He asked me to clarify, so I explained I’m not a big fan of cemeteries (not that I’m creeped out by them, but just being there makes me uncomfortable and I feel no connection to the deceased by being there) and that I don’t even go to my own deceased family’s graves. I also explained that I’ve been stretched pretty thin at work lately (which he is aware of) and didn’t want to give up 3-4 hours of my weekend.We didn’t have a big blowout over it or anything. But we did have a back-and-forth where he said he could use the support from me and I explained that I felt like I’ve given him a lot of support these last few weeks and that I need to draw the line at some point if supporting him puts me in an uncomfortable position.

dhrhuw	AmItheAsshole	Healthy eating is super important to me. I have small children at home, and a large part of my mental space is occupied by thinking about how I can ensure that my family has a generally healthy diet. I'm not completely obsessed. The kids eat cake and ice cream at parties. We take them out to ice cream now and then. I give them a few pieces of chocolate in their lunches. We do a special breakfast once a week where the kids can vote on pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc. But I see healthy eating as one of the most important values that I can instill in my family.The kids usually choose crepes for their special breakfast. These are the richest and least healthy option. I make pancakes and waffles with wheat and oat flour, but crepes I do by our traditional family recipe--butter, sugar, white flour… It's a special treat, and I want them to enjoy it. The only filling we use is pure maple syrup, and the one thing I ask is that we don't use a ton of it. Crepe batter is super rich, maple syrup has lots of sugar, and it is very expensive. I tell them a little goes a long way. Plus, it's healthier to use just a little!We roll our crepes like a burrito, and just like putting ingredients in a burrito, I ask everyone to apply a single line of syrup down the center along the roll rather than pouring haphazardly all over the surface. Not only does it help us use less, but it’s reasonable given the burrito roll method. (When you cut it into small sections, each bite will have the same amount of syrup in the center.) The kids get the rationale, and I make sure that I lead by example.My wife can't get behind the single line of syrup thing though. She likes sweet things and uses lots of syrup on her crepes. She pours in a spiral over the whole surface, using about 3x what anyone else does. For a long time, when she helped the kids fill their crepes, she refused to pour a single line, instead slathering syrup all over. I think it was a sort of protest, as she sees me as being too nitpicky. After a lot of complaining on my part, she did change, but it was a real headache.I want her to jump on board with the syrup thing so that we can send a consistent message to the kids. I have suggested this to her on various occasions and explained my reasoning carefully. I don't think it's unreasonable or irrational to think that we should have a family policy around this, and I have trouble understanding why this should represent a significant problem for her.She thinks I'm being unreasonable and irrational in asking this of her--that it's purely a matter of preference and that I shouldn't be pressuring her in any direction. I want us to be a team on this. This is the only breakfast for which I feel the need to have such family standards--I don't say anything specific about pancakes, waffles, etc. (you need to spread syrup all over the surface of those, although I do still want people to be modest about syrup use).AITA?

I just wanna give a quick example, we went to my cousins wedding and had to sleep over my sisters house the night before. My son had a blanket on the couch, and left it there while he went to go make breakfast. Laura, when she woke up, looked at the blanket, then asked him furiously ""are you going to fucking pick this up? You're just going to fucking leave this here like some slob? Pick it the fuck up"" at a volume that most of the people in the house could hear. My son doesn't even want to talk back to her for fear of escalating her anger, so he just did it. Another example is that my son left a pan in the sink to soak before washing it, and she flipped a shit and started calling him lazy and a brat and all this stuff. Over one pan. One time she asked my husband to do Yoga and he didn't want to, and she basically started berating him for being unhealthy and making his refusal to do yoga into this big thing. One time my son was having a migraine and had to cancel going to his aunts dinner, and Laura just absolutely berated him and insulted him for not 'sucking the pain up and going'. That is a microcosm of how she acts, not only to them, but to us as well, and her boyfriends and friends. If she finds even the slightest thing wrong with someone, she will point it out, viciously.

e5vobu	personalfinance	In January 2017 I opened a Bank of America account and deposited a paper check from my employer through the app. It was a payroll check, made out to me, endorsed by me on the back. It hadn’t cleared for about a week, so I called and they said it had been flagged as fraud because it was the first deposit to my account and it was a large amount ($1300) and my account would be closed. I went back and forth for about 2 months with fraud prevention dept. and they said a cashier’s check would be sent to my address. They couldn’t provide me a tracking number, wasn’t being sent via certified mail (so it didn’t have to be signed for to be released) or couldn’t send me any kind of proof that it was being sent. I was traveling for work at the time, so quite honestly I just forgot about it until recently. My question is: am I in the wrong here?!

e89nna	AmItheAsshole	I moved in with a friend about four months ago. Things had been going pretty well with the exception of her making a chore chart for us without even consulting me. I have a boyfriend of about a year and a half. He comes over/sleeps over about three days a week. He’s a shift worker so he gets off around 2 pm and sometimes I am not home at that time. So occasionally I’ll give him my key the day before. One of these days my roommate was home and was alarmed he had a key. I explained the situation to her and she said that if he was going to stay over a lot, she was uncomfortable and that he would need to pitch in for rent. I felt like both of these requests were slightly ridiculous. When we moved in together, I told her my boyfriend comes over often (although she claims I said two days a week). Additionally, he’s in my room 99% of the time. It’s not like he’s hanging out in the living room or taking her food or anything crazy. However, I am not a confrontational person and, in the moment, I agreed he would only comeover two days a week. I want to value her being comfortable and maintain that relationship. That being said, I pay just as much rent as she does and do just as much upkeep around the apartment as she does. After sleeping on it, I’m not sure just going along with what she says is appropriate.	EXPERT	So, your boyfriend never gets water?

e97v56	personalfinance	Backstory: My father passed away and left me some money. It's not an enormous sum but it's not small either.   The estate has been settled through a law firm in Australia. They asked me for my banking info to wire the funds to my account but then said their bank refused the transaction because my bank requires wires to go through an intermediary bank first. After doing some research it seems that all U.S banks have to use an intermediary bank for international transfers? Can anyone confirm this? Are there any U.S banks that receive international wires directly with no intermediary?  The only other option the law firm has given me is to have a bank draft couriered to me. This scares me for two reasons:  1. What happens if the bank draft goes missing en route? Does all that money just disappear with it?2. Is an American bank just going to allow me to walk into a branch and deposit a large amount of money drawn on a foreign bank?

ea4hnu	AmItheAsshole	"My (20) girlfriend (21) has a very severe phobia of cold things. We live in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.It's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is ""ridiculous"", and she needs to ""get some therapy"" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this.

eerl33	AmItheAsshole	So I (21F) am in my junior year of college. I’ve been extremely careful on not getting pregnant and have tried all avanues. My IUD moved and I almost died so I had to get it removed, the implant in my arm left a rash and started to burn so I had it removed, so me and my FWB started using the calendar and condom method which is basically when I’m not ovulating we would use the pull out method and when I was we would use a condom and a Plan B just for backup.Well, I’m pregnant. I found out in the beginning of December that I am four weeks along. I knew immediately I didn’t want to keep the baby. I considered going through with an abortion via the pill. I got them but couldn’t do it. I know that it was selfish, but until you’re in those shoes you never know how it truly feels.So I decided adoption. I told my friend that I was planning on delivering the baby and she told me about her brother and her sister in law back in her home state that have been struggling with infertility and have been desperately trying to conceive a baby for years without fail. We FaceTimed a few times and I think they would be perfect parents for my baby. They’re both well educated with well paying jobs and an amazing home they could raise a baby in. It actually made me excited to be able to know that the baby will go to a family that so desperately wants them. I decided they would be a great fit and since they’re so far away, it’s like it never happened kinda thing.I finally brought it up to my mom yesterday that I’m pregnant and everything else. My moms first words were “What about Sylvia? Her and Jon would love a baby”. My older stepsister is 28 and infertile. She’s known this for years and we aren’t that close so I didn’t know if she ever planned on having a baby through other means.I said no. Sylvia lives in the same city as me and I see her during holidays and any other family gatherings. I don’t want to adopt the baby into my own family circle and still have to be in some form of its life. I would basically become the step aunt? I just prefer the idea of having a closed adoption in a far away state with a picture every once in a while. My mom started gushing and called Sylvia immediately despite my protests who seemed really happy. She told my mom they were looking into an egg donor and a surrogate but this baby is so much less expensive and less of a hassle.I told Sylvia that I don’t want to give the baby to her for the reasons I listed above and kind of already “promised” another couple that they could adopt the baby. Now I haven’t went through any legal channels via the other couple so it’s not like I HAVE to do it, but I really want to. Sylvia got upset and asked why I would choose a random couple that I know nothing about versus my own “flesh and blood” (Our parents have only been married for 3 years and we never lived under the same roof as she was 25 then). She and my mom both called me assholes.	EXPERT	What if you disagree with their parenting?	Like wtf, you used other methods so you clearly are informed about bc but instead of always using a condom you decided to try the pullout method???	expert vs. novice	-1
eerl33	AmItheAsshole	So I (21F) am in my junior year of college. I’ve been extremely careful on not getting pregnant and have tried all avanues. My IUD moved and I almost died so I had to get it removed, the implant in my arm left a rash and started to burn so I had it removed, so me and my FWB started using the calendar and condom method which is basically when I’m not ovulating we would use the pull out method and when I was we would use a condom and a Plan B just for backup.Well, I’m pregnant.

ef23l3	personalfinance	I apologize in advance if this isn't the correct place to post!&amp;#x200B;I'm 23 years old and planning on buying a house in the next 5-10 years. My question is would it be a good idea to create and treat a Roth IRA solely as a down payment savings account? I'm already contributing/employer match to a 401k for retirement. My reasoning is it seems like a no-brainer if you can withdrawal your contribution plus the interest with no penalty or taxes for a first time home buyer. After the 5-10 years and I buy a house, I would then start to treat the Roth as another retirement account with my 401k.&amp;#x200B;Would this be a good option, or would I be better off using another method for saving for a home?&amp;#x200B;Any advice is appreciated!	LOC	Question 2 is pretty easy to answer; is the amount that you would be saving each year towards the home under the Roth limit?	By the numbers it seems like having money growing tax free for an allowable purpose would be a good thing?	US vs. non-US	-1

efe8fg	personalfinance	"Hi all,just a question I was wondering about recently as I am no expert on cars. Lets say I buy a car for 50k, how would I value / capitalize / depreciate my car overtime? The main questions are the following (assume that no accident / major damage has ever occurred):1. how much value does the car lose in value immediately after purchase (thus a certain part of the purchase price was normally the profit margin for the dealer, how much would that be)2. lets say I never use the car after purchase, at what rate would the car lose value (assume I still take care of the car in the sense that I drive it from time to time so for example the battery doesn't die. This implies an abnormal use of the car, but I am asking this simply as a means of control).3. Lets say I use the car normally, does the car lose value by kilometer / mile, or rather by its age or do the two factors interact?4. Is there a ""terminal value"" of the car where the car still has like a rest value and is no longer really losing value or rather the loss in value is marginal after that point?5. Is there something else I should consider that I did not write here?"	EXPERT	at what point does one start to appreciate?

Since then, he has become very financially abusive. He's threatened to kick us out of our place ***at least*** three times and turn off our cell phones more than that. My mom said he has always spied on her (early in their relationship he used to tape record her in the car) but since his name is on the phone bill account, he was able to go through the numbers my mom has called and ask them what their relationship is to her. She says she's caught him stalking her (no pictures of this) multiple times since he moved out. One time during an argument he told me to my face that my mom is a lying bitch and has instigated fights with her in front of my little sister whom he is the father of even though my mom tried to walk away. There are many different instances (he gave my mom a black eye once during a mutual altercation) I can go into but I'm trying to stay as vague as possible for fear of this backfiring on my mom and her case in any way. I don't think they've begun the formal divorce process. He also has a card to posses a firearm. The last time I checked, he has one in his possession however my mom says otherwise.Today, however, my mom confronted him about some precarious information she found about him and he has called me over 18 times, sent me a threatening text to once again cut off our phones (he uses the words ""tell her to stop playing with me"" though which scared me to no end), and has been stalking around our house for three hours now. He banged on the doors and windows. I suspect he's still out there as I'm typing this.I'm truly stuck here. My mom is not taking these things seriously. I'll admit, I have always been very anxious about/around men since I read a lot of stories about domestic violence ending in death and step-father's killing their families, but this seems like a textbook case for disaster. I'm not sure if any of this warrants an order of protection, I think it does, but I'd appreciate it if anyone can comment on that. Also, what further steps I can take to protect my family.
